The location is perfect and thanks to all the information and tips from Teresa you can experience Dublin from its best side! If we go back to Ireland or Dublin, then one hundred percent to Teresa!

It was my first week in Dublin and I had only good experiences. Close to the house there are some pubs, and a shopping center with two malls. The train station is 10 minutes walking distance and there is a bus stop in front of the house. Teresa and her husband are kind and very special people, they did everything to make us feel at home, starting with a good hot tea when we arrived.

Highly recommend the stay. : )"

The house and the room, we lived in, had everything we needed for a short stay in this wonderful city. The room was fully equipped as was the kitchen and the bathroom, everything is as given in the descriptions, it's tidy and really nice. 

Thank you for a lovely time in the ""holy cottage"" in Dundrum/ Dublin!
We loved staying there and would always recommend to also do so when going to Dublin!"
44077,504701668,8/8/2019,"Churchtown,  aka dumdum is about 15-30 minutes from the city centre of Dublin depending on which public transit you take,  which is so easy to get to within minimum walking distance. Ms. Teresa's cottage is quaint and very comfortable. You feel like you belong there automatically. Spacious one room accommodation that is clean and super comfortable. Shared space in the kitchen and bathroom for now more than six total guests at a time. Their backyard garden is amazing and so great to sit, enjoy a cup of tea with fresh fruit or toast and jam that is provided daily. Muffins and cereals as well are usually on the menu. This was such a great time, I can't wait to go back!"
44077,511231448,8/17/2019,"Staying with Teresa was the best decision we could have made. 
Teresa and her husband Hugh are incredibly friendly and really take care of their guests to make sure they feel welcome. They have lots of information about exploring the city, restaurants, pubs, things to do, public transport, you name it.
The room was bigger than we expected and very pretty with lots of attention to detail. The room, bedroom and kitchen were perfectly clean. Teresa offers a lovely breakfast as well, different kinds of bread, jam, nutella, cereal, tea, coffee... you name it. The perfect way to start a long day of sightseeing 
Our personal highlights were the fluffy towels and the heated blankets.
I would absolutely book this place again,  not only because of the stylish room but also because of the wonderful hosts."

85148,451269911,5/11/2019,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
85156,418489826,3/2/2019,Teresas place is a quite locality and is very stylish with very thoughtful touches. She and her husband are very respectful of the person staying at the property and at their toes to help when needed.
85156,420996820,3/8/2019,Hosts were brilliantly helpful. The house was amazing and near everything we were interested in getting to. Also Teresa is a saint. We had a minor scheduling issue and they worked through it with us without a complaint and were super kind through the whole thing. You wont find a more lovely couple in all Dublin and that is saying something. Everyone we met was super nice.
85156,425866323,3/19/2019,Very kind and sweet people. A pleasure to stay with them!
85156,431615187,4/1/2019,Teresa and Hugh are wonderful hosts in their cozy cottage in Churchtown. Great spot for launching into exploring Dublin.

85156,449311799,5/6/2019,"We had a wonderful time at Teresas place! The room and the house are neat and clean, the bed really comfortable! Teresa and her husband are really charming and will recommend you the best place of Dublin to visit. Thanks for all the advices and see you surely soon!"
85156,452573389,5/13/2019,"Despite the late hour we wer greeted super friendly. Our room was perfectly equipped,  clean and big enough for two people. Breakfast was included in the price and there was a lot of choice. The house is super cozy and the two hosts (Hughie and Teresa) are super nice and lovely. We felt right at home. With the bus or the train/tram one arrive within 20 minutes in the City centre. The connections are good. I would recommend the accommodation to anyone who doesn't want to live right in the centre of Dublin. You could also meet some other guest and have nice conversation with them. Dundrum is a very beautiful and idyllic place. Perfect holiday with a perfect accommodation :)"
85156,455170576,5/19/2019,"Very nice hosts, all good."
85156,456754300,5/22/2019,"Gorgeous backyard with plenty of seating, beautiful kitchen with 3 walls of windows, and free arking on site! They are very friendly people with a lovely home."
85156,464273207,6/5/2019,What a wonderful little home with warm and caring hosts! I could not recommend Teresa and her husband more; they were both happy to tell us about different places to visit in the area and were interested in learning about our lives back in the States. Our room was cozy and had everything we needed for our week-long stay. The Holly Cottage was the perfect home-away-from-home for our first trip to Ireland and we couldn't have asked for better hosts.
85156,469871589,6/15/2019,"Theresas place is fantastic - I stylish and tidy Irish house far from the city center but very accessible with the bus - the ride offers the possibility of capturing the citys beauty :) You also benefit of a breakfast with a view - part of the kitchens walls are made of glass and you can see the beautiful garden. 

She was very hospitable and offered a lot of information regarding places to visit as tourists. 

I would gladly return there!"
85156,471906714,6/18/2019,"T and Huey are so awesome!! Their house is sooo cute and very close to the 14 bus that takes you into town. They are also very helpful with tips around the town, and on what you should do. Highly recommend!"

85156,489721720,7/17/2019,"Teresa was very friendly and patient with us, although we had some unexpected changes in our travel plan. The flat was very comfortable, tidy and nice. The breakfast was also very good. During the night the water heater turned on every now and then, which was quite noisy and kept waking the sleeper up. However, we can highly recommend Teresas place!"
85156,494525920,7/24/2019,"Accoglienza calorosissima! Teresa ci ha guidati prima ancora che chiedessimo informazioni. Casa molto pulita, persone gentilissime."
85156,498739266,7/30/2019,"We spent a lovely week-end at Teresa's place. The cottage is very well situated, it's very easy to get to the city centre and Teresa and her husband provided us with all the information we needed about public transport, places to visit etc. The house is cosy and clean, the bedroom really nice, the only problem is the water heater which is really noisy and kept waking us up at night. But for the rest of it, it was a great stay and we thank Teresa and her husband for their hospitality !"
85156,500430084,8/2/2019,A great alternative to an expensive Dublin hotel. Teresa is so friendly and it is truly lovely to come back to a suburban atmosphere when travelling. Simple transport options into Dublin City.
85156,502870923,8/5/2019,"Such a welcoming place to stay near Dublin. The cottage was even cuter than we could have imagined, and the hospitality made us feel at home. Would definitely come again."
85156,509855809,8/15/2019,"The cottege is nice, a bit away from the city center. Bright kitchen where self service cold breakfast is served. Room not big but cozy.  Good value for money! Thanks!"
85156,518816323,8/27/2019,"Teresa and her husband have a wonderful small house in churchtown. To the City Center it takes you about 30 to 45 minutes.
We had a nice little double room. In the bathroom it can get a bit busy,  as three room share one bathroom with toilet. 
Breakfast is continental and good."
85156,523762967,9/4/2019,"Amazing place to stay in a superb location, hosts are lovely. Would highly reccomend."

85156,528132141,9/12/2019,"Teresa and her husband run a lovely B&B. The rooms, while modest, are comfortable and very clean. Their location is well situated to grab public transit and Teresa is wonderful with help to get out and about with suggestions and directions. The only suggestion I have is for folks that are light sleepers and that is to bring ear plugs. The cottage is lovely, but there are noises in the early evening with other guests using the common washroom etc. Not unexpected with common facilities."
85156,533336742,9/21/2019,"Teresa and Hugh were so accommodating! They're lovely home was always clean, and they looked after us very well! Definitely would like to come back again"
85156,543297249,10/7/2019,"We highly recommend Teresa's house. She is such a amazing host and her home is perfect. Everything was clean and she had basic food for breakfast (i.e. bread, peanut butter, cornflakes, milk, orange juice). Also she waited when we arrived and gave us useful advices. She is more than willing to make your stay as comfortable and convenient as possible. If you're on your way to Dublin I' recommend staying at Teresa's home."
85156,544438292,10/10/2019,"Great place to stay, lovely  home"

159889,425478077,3/18/2019,"Margaret together with her husband Gordon are wonderful hosts. I couldnt have asked to stay with better hosts especially as I was a lone traveller. 

Their home is within access to bus routes so it is cheap and easy to commute from airport and into the city centre (‚Ç¨3 one way to centre from the bus stop at the end of their road)  on one bus no. 16. 

Theres a super value supermarket across the road where I got a leap card to load with bus fare (‚Ç¨5 for card). Theres also a pub across the road. 

I felt totally at home here. Nothing was too much to ask. And so laid back I didnt feel like I was getting in their way. 

I will definitely be visiting again and highly recommend Margarets place."

I recommend."
159889,437255852,4/14/2019,"Small room & very comfortable bed! Perfect for the single traveler & for a short stay. I felt at home  Margaret & her partner are super kind & love to have a conversation. They also offer a small breakfast! It was a surprise to me as I was not aware of this genuine perk. They also were accomodating to my unavoidable last-minute late check-in. Communication was timely! 
As for location, it is close to the airport & a 30ish-minute bus ride to the center. I definitely recommend!"
159889,444765864,4/28/2019,Warmly and welcoming homelike place with a cozy and comfy bed.

159889,462811262,6/2/2019,"Margaret was very kind and welcoming, you get an authentic Irish family vibe from them it was lovely. She was very understanding of my need for rest from jet-lag and would check in to make sure I was okay. Both hosts are very kind and accommodating"

159889,473194537,6/21/2019,"Margaret and Gordon's house was a FANTASTIC place to stay on my vacation (holiday (-:). I arrived by taxi and the neighborhood was so cute. I was let in and led to my room, did a little unpacking, and then got to hang out with Margaret for a bit until Gordon came home. Right away I felt like part of the family. They are a delightful Irish couple with lots of hospitality, stories and tips to offer.  I loved watching the family dynamic and felt comfortable making myself at home.  We went grocery shopping together which was fun for me as a traveler. 

Gordon had lots of Irish jokes and songs to share with me and we spend ages laughing and joking. Margaret introduced me to her family living next door and I had the most delightful time playing with her granddaughter.  It was wonderful to have people to chat with at tea in the morning and dinner at night. 

Gordon and Margaret offered me tips for traveling during the day, suggestions of places to visit and to see, and how to get there most efficiently. Even which buses were the best. I had fun following their advice and it made me feel more confident on my day trips. Plus, I knew I could contact them if something went awry and I needed assistance. It was really the complete package for someone traveling on a budget.

Thank you both for the wonderful week in Beaumont and for your hospitality - I would suggest that anyone who wants a homestay experience in Ireland should stay with this delightful family.

159889,485253398,7/10/2019,"Margaret and her husband were incredibly helpful, provided everything I needed and made me very welcomed during my short stay. Thank you."
159889,490353926,7/18/2019,Margaret was a lovely lady so kind and it was a home away from home. Location is perfect for city centre and airport and she arranged taxi in morning.
159889,491405774,7/20/2019,"Small, but nice and quiet room in a qiet neighbourhood. Close to various bus stations. Very friendly hosts :-)"

159889,496339900,7/27/2019,I had a lovely time at Margaret's place. Everything went smooth and she's a very kind and generous host. I really recommend her place and I'd love to go back for another stay. I wish you and Gordon all the best Margaret. Regards from France.
159889,499348398,7/31/2019,"Friendly, efficient and hospitable service with a personal touch. Quick responses online and happy to work around you with check-in times. Clean and comfortable room, nice house in a quiet Irish suburb and all-round great craic"
159889,508068754,8/12/2019,Easy access to the airport and the center of Dublin from there. Margaret is a very helpful and kind host. Comfy bed and breakfast are a big plus!
159889,516372374,8/24/2019,About 25 minutes to City Centre by Bus 14 or Bus 16. Friendly guests and hosts. Good pubs in the area and a supermarket near. The Beaumont neighborhood where it is located is quiet and calm during the day and evening.
159889,525875987,9/8/2019,"Margaret is kind, accommodating, and quick to respond. Her place is in a safe residential neighborhood conveniently located across the street from a grocery store and restaurants. Its only a 15 min taxi ride into the city or 10 min ride from the airport (or very close to the bus stop!). Had a great stay and would return!"
159889,528986192,9/14/2019,Nice place to stay for the first days in dublin
159889,529164390,9/14/2019,"The house is nice. The room was clean, warm and comfortable.

It suited me perfectly."

159889,532294144,9/19/2019,"Margaret was a very welcoming and friendly host. We had some nice conversations too. She gave me some tips on where to go for food etc. I stayed with Margaret for just one night. The house is conveniently located in a quite neighborhood close to the airport. The bus stops around the corner and takes you to the airport in less than 15 min. Despite my short visit, I enjoyed my stay."
159889,534977457,9/23/2019,The room is ok when you expect to have a small room with a single bed. The mattress is very soft and I had problems to sleep on it. The location is not really central- you first need to go to the bus stop around 10 minutes and then it takes around 30 minutes to downtown Dublin. If you do not like smoke you should not stay there as it is a smoker house and you smell it strongly in the room. For 1 or 2 days the stay is ok but the room is very small.
159889,536665786,9/27/2019,Place was just as expected. Margaret and her husband are very nice and will definitely make you feel like home if you let them. Had a great time during breakfast with them and they helped me with tips to visit the city. The location is very convenient to get to the airport too.
159889,546935725,10/14/2019,The best part of my 2 week trip to Ireland was meeting Margaret and her husband.  They were filled with great suggestions for places to visit and eat and always made me feel welcomed.  They have one of the few Airbnbs that offer a light breakfast and it was nice being able to keep food in the fridge for meals and snacks .   I highly recommend this warm and wonderful Irish family to stay with for your trip.

His house is cosy, spacious and inviting - great value for money. I am sure we'll book him again as soon as possible."

162809,477472446,6/28/2019,"We had a lovely one-night stay at Robbies as we recovered from our jet lag. The house is even nicer than it looks in the pictures, and the large windows and high ceilings really make it seem huge! The beds were comfortable, and we all slept well. Robbie was an outstanding host, helping us with luggage, providing refreshments (and breakfast!!), leaving detailed instructions around the house, and including sweet touches like leaving a childrens book of Irish history on our sons bed. While not really in Dublin, this place was easy to get to and could make a nice home base for exploring Dublin, the East Coast, and beautiful Wicklow.  Highly recommended!"
162809,478784619,6/30/2019,Robbies place was lovely. It is right by the bus lines so it is very easy to get to the city center or anywhere else you might like to go. His home is spacious and Robbie is a friendly and welcoming host!

The bathroom is extremely clean, as are the bedrooms. The whole place is peaceful and calm and lovely. The beds are fantastic as is the quiet, darkness and fresh air, and I slept like a log. Robbie accommodated me and my parents in two charming proper separate rooms for the same price as one room. Much much better than a hotel and the cultural exchange aspect was such a joy. Robbies instructions and communication was extremely helpful and detailed. Airbnb legend!"
162809,527578538,9/11/2019,The beds are glorified camp beds that are rock hard with thin mattresses. No lock on bathroom door. Host is delightful and very helpful. Place is easy to find only 25 mins on bus to city centre. Very basic but clean and lovely breakfast provided.

Clean, beautiful apartment with full kitchen and large bathroom, washing facilities and television. 1 double bed, 1 single bed and 2 pull out couch beds make for close quarters since the bathroom is off the bedroom but nice if youre a tight knit group. Highly recommended!"
165828,472279615,6/19/2019,"We found the apartment fairly clean and well stocked. It was easy to access public transportation to access Dublin. There are several convenience stores nearby, as well as a playground. Unfortunately the wifi was not working during our stay, which was a bit inconvenient. Also the couch/sofa bed mattress was thin and uncomfortable and very squeaky, with road noise quite prevalent in the common area. Having a washing Maschine was nice. I would recommend this Appartement overall."
165828,485088864,7/10/2019,Very nice flat and easily accessible to most of Dublins attractions. I would recommend it ; )
165828,524647875,9/6/2019,"Very lovely place. Loved the living room the most, it was bright and spacious. The fireplace was a pretty spot considering we don't have them where we're from. 

Only thing - the floor was so thin, every step my family and I took would make such a noise to the point that we had a neighbour complain. We feel bad about that.

But all in all, everything else was great. Location, etc. Even provided a book to help us around the house."
165828,531394424,9/17/2019,"Great trip. Flat was nice and clean and there was everything we needed for cooking. Not  far from city center, 5 min. walk to tram and Tesco. Also very nice neigborhood and good pubs near."
165828,533867958,9/22/2019,We were very satisfied with the stay.
165828,535872317,9/25/2019,We stayed three nights in the house. It is well located and organised. Just two notes: the sofa is a bit uncomfortable to sleep and the burner is a bit slow. But everything else was perfect and clean!
165828,538832886,9/30/2019,"Comfy for no more than three. Beautifully appointed, nice area."
165828,552719429,10/22/2019,"We spent 5 days at Grainnes's place and we had a wonderful time. Downtown is not located far away, you can easily get there by bus or the Luas or you can try the local bars nearby, very much recommended. The welcoming was extremely nice, we got many tips where to go and what to see, in which order. This was beyond my expectation and I did not experience such a warm welcoming anywhere before. The flat is well-equipped, I would recommend staying at Grainne's place."
165829,454044200,5/17/2019,great location

178860,419961053,3/5/2019,"Danielle and Francois are tremendously kind hosts. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was fabulous. Danielle was very quick to answer my questions before the trip and after the trip was great when I forgot something and had I come back and pick it up! Their home is the definition of Dublin quaintness - quirky with different levels and bright colors. The room was very comfortable. They also have the cutest cat! He gives pets out for free. As everyone else has said, the crepes are divine and they made sure I was able to have them even though it was unavailable on their typical Saturday morning crepe time. Would love to stay with them again."
178860,422010551,3/10/2019,"The bed was cosy and comfortable, the pancakes were super and Francois helped me greatly with taxis. A very considerate host."
178860,425512557,3/18/2019,"Great stay for the second time at Danielle and Francois! 

Spacious room, great people, good location. 

Thank you so much again, would recommend this place to everyone!"
178860,434718398,4/8/2019,"Great Airbnb experience! Awesome location, host and house. If youre lucky enough to stay on a Saturday night dont pass up the crepes Sunday morning they were amazing. Will stay here again if Im in Dublin!"
178860,443641258,4/26/2019,Excellent place.
178860,449354080,5/6/2019,"Danielle's place was probably one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at! Danielle was very respondent to all my messages and was very understanding of my later than expected check-in. The house is very clean, and there are various teas and coffee to enjoy in the kitchen. She even gave me lots of local recommendations and really helped me enjoy my stay in Dublin! The crepes that Francois made were also really delicious!"
178860,460535129,5/29/2019,"We had a delightful time staying with Danielle and her family who were warm, welcoming and happy to chat/offer local advice or let us do our own thing. Danielle also provided us with a shelf in the fridge, fast wifi, a cat to give hugs to and a superb collection of herbal teas. The bedroom was simple but great: large bed, no external noise, heating and lock on the door. The location was perfect: only a minute or two from a Tesco Express, laundromat, bars, pubs and trendy cafes and lots of beautiful instagram-worthy Georgian houses/streets. It's also only a 2 minute walk to buses that go straight into the city centre, all the tourist destinations or to Dublin airport. I stayed the final night alone as a young solo female traveller and felt 100% safe in both the house and neighbourhood and would highly recommend it."
178860,463520301,6/3/2019,Highly recommend. Great location.
178860,471243733,6/17/2019,"Very friendly and nice hosts in Dublin, we can certainly recommend to stay with Danielle!"
178860,478630978,6/30/2019,"Danielle and Francois were excellent hosts. They were so welcoming and accommodating, their place was beautiful and clean and had everything we could possibly need for a lovely break in Dublin. The pancakes were much enjoyed by us both and we would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Dublin. The location couldnt have been better, out of the way of hustle and noise yet easy walking distance to all the local attractions. Danielle and Francois were available when we needed them but gave us the privacy that we wanted whilst sharing their home. Leo the cat was a very welcomed addition. Thank you for having us, we will be back in the future."
178860,484219731,7/8/2019,Great place! Great host! 10 stars!

178860,513312122,8/19/2019,"Danielle and Francois are warm, well-travelled people. I enjoyed my privacy, while also feeling welcome. The space is beautiful. The bathroom fixtures and bathroom tile might be original; I have certainly never seen the like. The upper bedroom itself was quiet and spacious. It was no problem at all sharing the bathroom or making a cup of tea in the kitchen. The location is very good, and Danielle is responsive to all concerns or questions. A great experience."
178860,515121717,8/22/2019,"You can expect kindness in a big foreign city. She and her family went out of their way to accommodate myself and my daughter.....open heart, open door and respect for the Airbnb true purpose!!!"
178860,522559734,9/2/2019,"Danielles place was just perfect for my first trip to Dublin.  The house is a charming Georgian with lots of character and located on a quiet street in the Portobello neighborhood - but within walking distance to the city center.  The room was much bigger than I expected, and the bed was very comfortable, indeed.  Most of all, I enjoyed the kind hospitality of Danielle and Francois.  And I highly recommend booking an extra day to stay with them to enjoy the delicious home-made crepes made special for guests just on Sunday :)"
178860,530861947,9/16/2019,"Danielle's place is centered in a lively and convenient area of Dublin - the location was central to many of the places I wanted to check out, while still allowing me to feel like a local. Her home is clean, quiet, and perfect for anyone traveling solo (I was). Danielle was so accommodating and gave me great suggestions/tips. Her husband and daughter are also lovely and very welcoming. Thank you for a great stay!"
178860,542427782,10/6/2019,"I had never really stayed within a family situation and was a bit concerned, even though I knew them as I stayed downstairs last year. Not to fret it was as though I was an independent member off the family. Coming and going as i did an yet knew if I needed something they would be there"
178860,546846169,10/14/2019,Danielle and Francois were very welcoming and friendly! Their home is beautiful and in a great location.
178860,552300084,10/21/2019,Really nice and charming place and hosts! Centrally located to the city. Comfortable beds. Overall a great stay and value for the money :)
178860,555976668,10/28/2019,"I really enjoyed my stay with Danielle and Francois. I was in town for the marathon and stayed for 2 nights. Lovely room, nice and warm and the bed was comfy. I was treated really well and the crepes on Monday morning were amazing! I will definitely be back to stay again. Thank you!"
178860,567292653,11/22/2019,"This is my second time booking with Danielle and Francois. I love staying in a beautiful late Georgian house with a view, across a quiet street, of other beautiful late Georgian houses. Portobello is a great little neighbourhood, very close to my favourite cafe and to multiple interesting restaurants, and an easy walk to the National Concert Hall, the National Gallery, Stephens Green, Grafton St, etc. The house itself is quiet, and it was wonderful to relax in the huge bathtub after my busiest day. I see no reason to stay anywhere else when in Dublinîunless someone else beats me to it!"
181823,427499697,3/23/2019,"Loved this class. Inna is warm, welcoming, funny, and has truly infectious enthusiasm for chocolate. If youre curious youll learn a ton î Inna is a scientist in her day job and is happy to dive as deep as youd like into the physics of chocolate crystallization, phase changes, etc. The class involved a lot of tasting, of course, plus you take home the chocolates you make. Highly recommend!"
181823,434052514,4/7/2019,Norah was excellent host. We spend a short time with her but she was very friendly. The house is more closer to the center than we expected and is clean and comfortable.
181823,435427536,4/10/2019,"Norah is very friendly and welcoming, cozy interesting house ,  would stay again"

181823,440411941,4/20/2019,Inna is a great host! She made it special for our group by adding a couple of more edibles and chocolaty treats. She also customized a bit to accommodate the recipes more kids friendly and gave more suggestions to make it even better on our own the next time.
181823,440411860,4/20/2019,Very interesting lesson. Recommended to all.
181823,452300505,5/12/2019,"We loved the experience. Inna answered all our questions patiently, we got an opportunity to learn and know the basics of chocolates. We definitely recommend it. The best part is that Inna made us comfortable enough to email her questions when  we experiment it ourselves."

181823,476710879,6/26/2019,I had such a wonderful time. I brought a friend of mine to enjoy the experience with me. Neither of us had me truffles before but we were  very interested in learning. You made it very approachable-very easy and understandable. Really fun and exciting-lots of hands on experience. It was great to have a little drink and sample some chocolates before we started. but were very interested in learning. You made it very approachable-very easy and understandable. Really fun and exciting-lots of hands-on experience and it was great to have a little drink and sample some chocolates before we started.   I would totally recommend this class. We left with 3 to 4 samples of each travel we made so a total of nine pieces of chocolate  which were delicious.  We met some lovely people. Her home was beautiful  and clean and she was very organized and ready for class.   Wonderful time!
181823,482689056,7/6/2019,"I really enjoyed the chocolate truffle making class. I loved a personal touch of having mimosas. This made the class relaxing and didnt feel like a jobù. I really enjoyed playing with chocolate and making my own first nakedù truffle: it is something that I can take and make at home. It is a great event to do with the loved ones, if you are vacationing or simply want to get away with friends."
181823,482688606,7/6/2019,Inna was lovely!!!! We had so much fun learning how to make truffles.  We left with a deep appreciation of how delicate chocolate work can be... And a recipe to try our hand at it for our kids

181823,500227262,8/1/2019,I had the pleasure of booking a class with Inna for my dads birthday.  He and I absolutely loved the hands-on nature of the class.  Inna was so friendly and generous with her knowledge.  She made us feel relaxed and welcomed us with plenty of truffles and champagnes.  We left our class feeling full from plenty of delicious chocolates and excited to try it at home.
181823,505799678,8/9/2019,"My husband, in-laws and I absolutely LOVED learning how to make truffles with Inna. She was a fund of knowledge about tempering chocolate, making ganache, and how to take several different kinds of truffles. I had basically no knowledge about working with chocolate, but came home with little bags of truffles I'd made! We have a GREAT time and I highly recommend this experience!"
181823,505799686,8/9/2019,"We had a wonderful experience.  Even with a little experience in making chocolate desserts, Inna was quick to take me beyond my knowledge and lead us on a very intensive course about chocolate truffles.  She was very well prepared to get us through a fairly complex discussion and completely participatory experience.  And we left with the fruits of our labors!  Lemoncello flavored truffles are spectacular.  I'm looking forward to trying for myself after I lose a couple of pounds..."
181823,511772921,8/17/2019,It was a great and fun experience. Imma was so accommodating and wonderful. So a delicious and fun way to connect.
181823,521357288,8/31/2019,"Inna was a wonderful host! We started off with a wine tasting where we tasted different ports and Inna told us about wine history. Then, she walked us through the truffle making process step by step, and we were able to get very hands on with the chocolate! In the end, we made several different types of truffles under Innas supervision. Overall, a really great experience and would definitely recommend for any chocolate lovers :)"
181823,521175249,8/31/2019,"This class is so fun! She is very knowledgeable and really makes the class with how cool she is! We made 3 different types of truffles, tried a bunch of other ones, and had mimosas! So fun and would recommend"
181823,525444130,9/7/2019,"Fantastic experience! Inna was very knowledgeable about the subject, organised the class in a structured, well prepared way, and made it easy to learn the skills required to make truffles at home. Highly recommend!"
181823,525444024,9/7/2019,"I surprised my fiance with this class for his birthday and what a delight it was! We learned all about the California wine industry, enjoyed delicious Port and snacks, and then got into the nitty-gritty of truffle making.  My fiance loved it. I loved it. Inna even offered a small gift to him and the other birthday in the room. It was a great experience and I'm now super excited to make our own truffles in the future."
181823,525444096,9/7/2019,"We had such a fun time making chocolates with Inna. She's friendly, knowledgeable, and gracious. 
I highly recommend this experience to anyone interested in chocolate making. 
And the chocolates were delicious!"
181823,525444102,9/7/2019,We loved this experience. Inna was a great host and I would highly recommend her to anyone!
181823,527844718,9/11/2019,"We had an absolute blast learning how to make truffles with Inna. The experience was hosted in her own kitchen and living room, which makes for a very intimate atmosphere. I was blown away by her hospitality, passion for truffle making, and cheerful disposition. I can tell that Inna put a lot of thought into designing the class to be engaging, and she also did a lot of prep work before the class to ensure that it would proceed as smoothly as possible. I felt that the class was just the right amount of participation - everyone got to contribute to the truffle making process, but she was there the whole time to guide us and make sure we didn't cause a disaster in the kitchen. The truffles turned out delightful. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone."
181823,530533193,9/15/2019,"This was a fun evening of wine, dark chocolate, and getting inspired to make truffles. The truffles we made were a delicious souvenir of the class that didnt last long ì But we also got info sheets to give us guidance on making truffles at home."
181823,541844797,10/5/2019,"It was such a treat to get to taste the different wines and enjoy some chocolates/cheese platter before we started the class. The methods taught can be applied in the everyday kitchen and it was so enjoyable (and delicious!) learning how to make three types of truffles. Dark chocolate for the win! The whole experience felt really fun and intimate - thank you, Inna, for your hospitality!"
181823,541845219,10/5/2019,"We loved Inna's class and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about chocolate making! We made 3 types of truffles and Inna made it so easy to follow and understand each one. She was very patient and did a great job  emphasizing the key aspects of truffle making vs the things that didn't make a big difference in the process. It was easy to focus on what was important, and  Inna made sure everyone got to try doing each step. The portion of the night about port wines was informative and a great addition, too. And of course you leave with a bag full of delicious treats you made  10/10 experience!!!"
181823,541844957,10/5/2019,"Wow! My husband and I chose this as our date night and Im so glad we did! Number one, I love chocolate and Innas chocolates are incredible! She is a kind and thoughtful host which character and knowledge. We did the port tasting and she prepared various cheeses and nuts to pair with them. The cooking is all hands on so you really get to make the truffles. She also has these tricks of the tradeù shell teach you which is priceless if you really want to be able to recreate the magic of the truffles! Definitely worth every penny!"
181823,542961631,10/6/2019,"Inna is a great teacher, and her recipes and techniques truly do create the best chocolate truffles! We enjoyed the port tasting and brief history lesson, as well as the hands on chocolate session. We highly recommend Innas course for a fun and delicious time!"
181823,545625102,10/12/2019,A bliss! Just go and do it!!!
181823,546571451,10/13/2019,My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our truffle making experience with Inna. She was the perfect hostess and we learned about the history of Californian wine and port. We were able to enjoy some port and samples of the chocolates we would be making. Then we got our aprons on and learned how to temper chocolate and managed to make some really professional looking truffles which tasted delicious and got to take them home in a goody bag. It was a lot of fun and has inspired me to try  doing it at home.
181823,556582856,10/30/2019,"We were group of 7 guys trying some truffle making for the first time. Inna handled us great, responding great to our personal vibe and teaching us the art of truffle making. While this is not something we traditionally do as a group the entire group felt really positive about the overall experience and about Inna's style in particular"
181823,557818746,11/1/2019,Really enjoyed making truffles and drinking Port. Highly recommend!
181823,557818767,11/1/2019,"Very nice experience and inna is very knowledgeable about wine and chocolate...
A good host!!"
181823,559157881,11/3/2019,"Great class! It was a great choice for my wife and I on our anniversary, Id gladly do it again"
181823,559147486,11/3/2019,"Inna was a gracious and very friendly host. She was ready on time and made me feel welcome. It was a very interactive experience which I really appreciated; we went through how to make ganache and temper chocolate, she instructed us on the do's and the dont's. There was complementary background music that didn't intrude in the experience. I came out with a good understanding of how truffles work and truffles that I was involved in the making of."
181823,567201135,11/21/2019,"So much fun! Trust me, save up for the extra wine pairing event as well. Inna has a legendary taste and wisdom with her passuons"
200979,420448540,3/6/2019,What a fun afternoon! Lee Ann was friendly and the workshop was chill and fun! Went home with a lot of goodies!
200979,422662678,3/11/2019,"Excellent class and time well-spent.  We had a great time learning from Lee Ann and we took away some great natural products along with knowledge on how to create at home.  I really recommend this class, even for those who are not crafty.  It's great!"
200979,422659220,3/11/2019,It was fun and got to meet new people. Lee Ann was more than willing to give you one to one if you needed. The class was a very relaxed atmosphere.
200979,425646591,3/18/2019,Great hands-on experience. I really enjoyed getting know Lee Ann. Definitely recommend.
200979,425645411,3/18/2019,This experience was so much fun! The host Lee is sweet and incredibly helpful and created such a relaxed atmosphere to make the bath and body products. Cant recommend this enough!
200979,426627617,3/21/2019,"I booked this experience for my boyfriend, myself, and his friend, for his birthday weekend. SO SO GLAD I DID!!! All three of us had such a great time with Lee Ann! She was very fun, talkative, and informative! Highly recommend! We came home with SO much more product that we made ourselves then we ever imagined we would!"
200979,432350204,4/3/2019,"This was a spectacularly fun experience. I did benefit from having a lot of personal attention since I was the only one at this particular session (11am on a Wednesday in early April- not surprising I was a loner!). Lee Ann made me feel welcome & we chatted a lot while we created- turns out we have a lot in common (besides just being artsy!). I enjoyed my time & the conversation. As a teacher, I know classes can be different with a larger group dynamic, but I can totally see Lee Ann being able to translate her expertise into a bigger class size too. I absolutely recommend this workshop!"
200979,435859730,4/11/2019,A wonderful experience!
200979,435858218,4/11/2019,"This was such a fun experience -- and well worth the price!  We learned a lot, got new skills we'll use again, and walked away with a big bag full of our creations to use ourselves and give as gifts.  Met AND exceeded our expectations! My daughter even asked if Lee Ann might offer week-long camps because she wanted to do more!  Thankful to have found this opportunity for our visit to Portland!"
200979,438853620,4/17/2019,"Fun experience making bath bombs, lip balm, and lotions. Highly recommended."
200979,440274168,4/20/2019,"Highly recommended! Lee Ann creates a comfortable and relaxed environment and makes the experience fun. Lee Ann engages conversations and is great with kids! This is the second time my daughter and I have taken this experience with Lee Ann, and we had a great time!"
200979,444324514,4/27/2019,"If I could give this experience 10 stars, I would! Lee Ann graciously welcomed my group of friends into her studio for a private workshop experience. She is highly accommodating and a master at her craft. I highly highly would recommend this workshop if you want to try a new experience. This event was so much fun and she made me feel incredibly special on my birthday! I would definitely return for other classes if I am in the area again."
200979,452664863,5/13/2019,I felt so welcome there from a very first minute! Lee knows how to get people exited. Time passed so quickly.
200979,456848463,5/22/2019,It was a very interactive experience. Lee Ann was great at addressing any concerns or questions.  She was very knowledgeable and super nice.  Directions were easy to follow and the products came out amazing. The entire experience was super fun.
200979,469883514,6/15/2019,"A great home in Dalkey, plan on taking the train into Dublin to save some money (about 30-40 minutes). Safe neighborhood and wonderful town. Would definitely recommend."

200979,489662614,7/17/2019,"Pauls place is in a great location within walking distance to the lovely town of Dalkey and close to the DART train into Dublin too. Its really like a small house of your own with 2 bedrooms plus the living room with convertible bed, kitchen area, laundry, bathroom in a private, quiet, nice residential street. Paul is super helpful and friendly. Great place to stay!"

200979,519238930,8/28/2019,This is a lovely private property with lots of thoughtful touches to make it a home from home.  We had plenty of space and the beds were very comfortable and it was so quiet at night that we all slept very well. The kitchen was well stocked and everything easy to use. Paul was very friendly and flexible with check out and we would definitely stay here again when next in Dalkey

200979,530082752,9/15/2019,"Really lovely stay - beautifully appointed and spacious house.  The host has thought of everything - lots of very helpful little accessories. Warm and comfy, gorgeous location, even had a bit of a water view from the bedroom. Highly recommended."
200979,534067634,9/22/2019,"Paul's place is great and Paul is a great host. The house has all you need and is nicely decorated. We all felt at home!
The location is perfect, 5 min to the Dart station! Dart trains run often and take you to Dublin in 30min. Dakley village and area are also very much worth a visit. I would 100% recommend this house!"
200979,543750509,10/8/2019,"Pauls cottage is very conveniently located just a five minute walk to the DART station in Dalkey and the historic seaside town of Dalkey. The home is very secure behind locked gates and the interior has everything  you would need for a very comfortable stay. Paul and his wife are excellent hosts, going the extra distance to make sure their guests feel oriented, comfortable and welcome in Ireland! I would highly recommend staying in this home to any small family! Eunice from Mystic, CT USA"
200979,547482208,10/15/2019,We had a family wedding in Killiney and had family over from abroad. Paul made them feel welcome and treated them like family. Thank you for the kind and thoughtful touch of champagne and snacks on their arrival. They had a wonderful stay. Cant recommend enough Paul and his lovely home. Thank you.
200979,551415639,10/20/2019,"Great amenities! The washer and dryer were a life saver! He even had bandaids in the bathroom, thank goodness, because I injured my finger at one of our castle visits and was able to protect it when we arrived back at the house. The gated entrance made us feel super safe as well. It was a great stay."
200979,554081926,10/25/2019,"I was beyond happy with this experience! I booked this class for me and my sister for her birthday present, and it was so amazing. Lee Ann is very knowledgeable and friendly, and an amazing host. I couldnt believe how many things I made and took home with me. Well worth the price! I will definitely be booking a class in the future."
200979,555202023,10/27/2019,"We had a fabulous time, it was everything we hoped for."
200979,558036753,11/2/2019,A 5 star experience!
200979,562679747,11/11/2019,Paul was very nice and always available to help.
200979,566011308,11/18/2019,"Paul is a fantastic host, he communicated constantly prior to our stay to ensure we had everything we needed. Check in was simple and the house is very homely with all the amenities you would need. A great place to stay and I hope to visit again in the future."
200979,568393257,11/24/2019,Dalkey is my favorite village in Ireland... and Paul and Geraldine are my favorite hosts whenever I am in town.  Thank you both for being GREAT hosts !!!!!   I'll be back :)
237465,422486003,3/11/2019,Great place in a quiet neighborhood.
237465,426239278,3/20/2019,Amanda and Paul are very friendly and helpfull. It is a great place to stay when visiting Dublin. Close to the Airport and just 25min to the City center.
237465,430361152,3/30/2019,"Amanda's place is clean, inviting and you find everything you might need. If you require anything else, be it bicycles or a fresh set of towels, Amanda makes sure you get it and that you can feel at home."
237465,432266524,4/3/2019,"Amandas place was just what my son and I needed after traveling for over a week, it was great because you could cook there, do a laundry and a quiet place away from city.  I would stay again.  The 27a bus was quite convenient (a walk to stop)  , also the trip to Howeth was so easy from train and a beautiful spot.  We loved it. Thank you."
237465,436484475,4/13/2019,It's a lovely place to stay in a nice neighborhood. And it's perfect for visiting Dublin as it's just a five minute walk to the next bus station which brings you directly to Dublin. We really enjoyed the time!
237465,444575025,4/28/2019,Great!
237465,453287425,5/15/2019,"We had a lovely stay, Amanda had tons of great information of local attractions, the best was her own information book she put together about suggested visits, how to, for the (Website hidden by Airbnb) Apartment was perfect size, comfy, clean and we felt safe. A city bus stop is close by & public park to run in. I definitely would stay again."
237465,461923354,6/1/2019,"It's a good house to stay long or short period, not really near from the center of Dublin but enough to have everything not far, not noisy at all.
Amazing hospitality with Amanda.
Definitively we MUST comeback."
237465,463859904,6/4/2019,"great place for a stay in Dublin, right by the bus route and close to a grocery store"
237465,469197676,6/14/2019,Fantastic experience! Great host! 10/10 would stay again!
237465,470618290,6/16/2019,It was a great stay at Amanda's place specially we were able to use the bikes to roam around Dublin..
237465,472711463,6/20/2019,The flat was clean and comfortable. Quiet neighbourhood. Felt safe. We purchased a visitors LEAP pass which made to use of public transport much more convenient but had problems with our first trip prior to purchase of the card as the buses only accept coins. Although the bus stop was 10 minute walk and 20 min to the city we found the time spent catching public transport a took a large chunk of time out of each day. Supermarket 15 min walk away.
237465,477022175,6/27/2019,Great place to stay for a few days in Dublin. Really clean and tidy with all the amenities. Communication with the host was excellent and we took up suggestions for places to go which was excellent. We chose to take the train to the city centre and this was an easy 20-25 minute walk and very cheap. Would definitely stay here again!
237465,478646774,6/30/2019,Pleasant stay.
237465,483260439,7/7/2019,Eenvoudige accommodatie. Voldoet voor een paar dagen. Lange reistijd naar centrum.
237465,490216444,7/18/2019,"Everything exactly as stated in the description. Very clean, everything worked perfectly, great location - both train and bus access. Amanda provided many nice tips for trips and how to get around. I recommend to stay at her place! I even got extra service as Amandas husband saved me when I kind of locked myself in the room. :) Thanks a million!"
237465,494500552,7/24/2019,"It is a super cozy apartment, close to the center of Dublin and everything you can imagine.  My mother and I had a very pleasant stay here."

We loved ours stay in this flat we recommend this accommodation."
237465,501318043,8/3/2019,"Rare Affordable option for Dublin, confortable for a couple or for 2 friends. You need a Phone To get To the city by bus, once you know where To go, it Will take you 25 mins."
237465,508765564,8/13/2019,"The place was very good, tidy and clean. Close to the center if you are visiting Dublin. I would recommend staying here, 10/10."

237465,518273272,8/26/2019,We had a wonderful Weekend at Amandas place! Tidy and clean.
237465,524706575,9/6/2019,"The property is close to the airport.  The faint, low rumbling you hear are airliners landing, but it's not intrusive.   The path through the athletic fields wil get you to the bus stop faster than taking the sidewalk through the neighborhood.  This is the stop for the 27A bus into town.  It takes about 30 minutes, depending upon traffic.  You can buy a LEAP card in town giving  you unlimited travel on the local bus routes, tram routes (Luas), and local trains.  The nearest shopping to the property is a shopping mall with a large Tesco at one mile (1.7km) away.  The nearest train station is in the opposite direction at slightly over a mile (1.8km) away.  Unfortunately, the 27A doesn't go near either of those destinations.
The bedroom curtains are a little thin, so it gets light rather early.  The kitchen has a good selection of pots and pans with lids, but the choice of utensils is limited.  There is a rubber spatula with a strangely curved blade and a plastic ladle.  There are no sharp knives, a cutting board, or mixing bowls.  The cutlery consists of three forks, two dinner knives, a soup spoon and a teaspoon.  There is an aluminum baking pan in the oven, but it has peeling paint, and I wouldn't put food into it.  The oven and stovetop are missing half of their original knobs along with the temperature dials, so cooking can be hit or miss.
The shower stall has some problems.  One of the doors comes off its tracks very easily.  The top of the frame itself is literally held together with duct tape., so the doors don't close completely.  There is no mat on the floor, so you will need to use a towel for the water that comes through the crack.  There is no anti-slip mat in the shower.  The outside of the frame could use a good scrubbing.
There is a washing machine, which is good to have, but there was no washing detergent.  We supplied a box of washing soap, and anti-slip mat for the shower, and ice cube trays ."
237465,526706903,9/9/2019,"Simple, well-maintained space with owners right next door. Wide open public space nearby and walkable streets."
237465,530853879,9/16/2019,"Was a very nice spot!! It is on a corner so there is total privacy from neighbours. Very nice location,  Esay bus route into city, also close to a super cute town!  We did meet some neighbours and they were quick to smile and welcome us in! 
We would def stay here again and would highly recommend it! Thanks Paul and Amanda!"
237465,531756642,9/18/2019,"Very accommodating hosts, communication is very open and they're extremely helpful with anything you can ask for. Was very pleased with the cottage and how clean everything was kept. Instructions were easy to understand."
237465,533348029,9/21/2019,"Amanda's place was perfect for my visit to Dublin! The space was a great size. There are 2 twin beds, a full bathroom, and a kitchen with stove and oven. The space is a 5 minute walk to the nearest bus stop which takes you straight in to Dublin city center. Amanda was fantastic with communication. She booked us a taxi for our 6am flight, and you can message her with any questions you may have. Overall, she was a fantastic host and I will definitely book with her again if I am back in Dublin!"
237465,535432986,9/24/2019,"Space was great and very comfortable. Parking was easy and the place was conveniently located to a rail and to a bus, so we didn't have to do much driving. Amanda, and her husband, were very nice and helpful."
237465,548357589,10/17/2019,Very kind hosts. We had an issue with the toilet and they got the parts and managed to fix it almost immediately (even on a Sunday!!). Lots of suggestions and tips as well. A bit of a ways from the city centre but once youre comfortable with the busses its easy to make your way around.
237465,552333546,10/21/2019,Amandas place was so clean. It is adorable and cozy. Its about a 30 minute bus ride from city center but the bus stop is really close by. Amanda leaves a really helpful information packet in the room and is also great at responding to any questions. 10/10 would reccomend.
237465,553887707,10/25/2019,"Perfect airbnb for us, will stay again- thanks Amanda"
237465,557177257,10/31/2019,"This b&b is conveniently located minutes from tourist attractions just north of Dublin and offers basic amenities, as listed. (bring your own body wash and shampoo)  The mattresses and the couch were well lived in but the annex was comfortable and warm.  Having a washing machine/dryer was definitely a bonus. The other appliances worked well. Apart from a curious incident when a couple of drunk individuals tried to open our door one night, the neighborhood was quite. Finding the apartment was a bit challenging because we arrived late at night time and we couldn't see the house numbers very well. We had minimum interaction with the host because we were gone most of the time. However, they made themselves available and communication went smoothly."
237465,560013184,11/5/2019,"Clean, well equipped, cca 20 minutes from city centre by taxi. Recommended!"
237465,561379771,11/9/2019,"The location was quiet and very comfortable. It was easy to get in and out of the heart of the city. I used nearby public transportation which was cheap, quick, comfortable and helped me capture some cool photos of the city. Great place and friendly people."
237465,562682324,11/11/2019,"Lovely place. The host is super friendly, great communication. Would definitely recommend"
237465,565249394,11/17/2019,Very cozy space
245903,441817418,4/22/2019,Sheila is a great host that took great care of me and was always quick to help me when there were problems. The room is small but comfortable and clean as was the bathroom and the kitchen. I'm not the most social person but Sheila always gave me enough space and a quiet place to learn for my studies. It was very easy to get to the city centre and the tcd from her house. I had a great time staying with her!
245903,525834555,9/8/2019,"Friendly and accommodating host. Room clean, quiet, safe and comfortable. Conveniently located. Would definitely recommend."
245903,547455076,10/15/2019,Sheila is the best of the best and her home is great :)

Absolutely high recommendable! Thank you for everything :-)"
261248,425878571,3/19/2019,"We had a great time at the BnB. The room was very small and the shower wasn't high enough for my husband but it worked out very well. The bed was super comfy. Breakfast is only toast, jam and cereal but was enough for starting the day. Brian and Phyllis are very lovely. DART is only 7 to 10 mins away. And eagle house has some fun live musicians which is only 5 mins away."

261248,446390131,5/1/2019,Had a lovely stay with Brian and Phyllis! Really look forward to my stays in their welcoming home.
261248,450720947,5/10/2019,"Bed was very comfortable, shower was hot, room was clean. BUT, room was freezing cold, even though we told them; could only get out of bed on one side bc room so small"

261248,471819840,6/18/2019,"Myself and sister were disappointed in our stay. We loved the location and the surrounding area was beautiful, however we found the room extremely dated and dusty. We also felt the room smelt very musty, forcing us to go and buy an air freshener. We slept poorly due to an uncomfortable bed, and noisy surroundings."
261248,472796625,6/20/2019,Had a great stay with Brian and Phyllis again! Two of the nicest people and always make you feel very welcome!
261248,473345688,6/21/2019,"Excellent B&B in great coastal location, 5 walk to train and hosted by friendly couple. I'm sure I'll stay here again"

261248,493418223,7/22/2019,It was nice to stay here. Good start with breakfast. Close to train that goes directly to Dublin (30 min or so). 5 min walk to a few restaurants and the sea view. Room a little small and older but a part of the charm.
261248,495696714,7/26/2019,Good place and nice hosts
261248,498761776,7/30/2019,"Nice old house, with parlor as breakfast room, and available to make tea anytime.  Old style feel. Family share nicely seeing to check-in, cooked breakfast if desired, etc. Nice old bnb near coffeeshops, seashore park."
261248,503742076,8/6/2019,We arrived quite late but Brian and Phyllis let us stay for the night. Everything fine. Thanks again!
261248,507117716,8/11/2019,Great breakfast

261248,524188135,9/5/2019,"Slightly dated decor as expected but hard to fault when it's clean, tidy, in a great location and very reasonably priced."
261248,526016512,9/8/2019,"Great, I'll visit once again if i am there"
261248,528511985,9/13/2019,"I had a brief overnight stay in Brian and Phyllis' B&B which was perfectly suited for my needs. Everything was clean and tidy. The location was nice and quiet so I could sleep soundly during the night. Although I did not meet Phyllis, Brian was very friendly and helpful. I overhead him giving advice on places to visit and eat to some American tourists who were also staying in the B&B, and he seemed willing to go out of his way to ensure his guests had everything they needed. To top it all off, the room was great value for money. I would definitely recommend Brian and Phyllis' B&B and would visit again myself. Thank you both :)"
261248,529764879,9/15/2019,"The place was as described, but unfortunately it was noisy (I could hear the doors opening/closing and the neighboors speaking in their room) which woke me up a couple of times in the morning!"
261248,530833737,9/16/2019,Cosy place with breakfast included

261248,546996653,10/14/2019,"Lovely location, I had no problem finding parking for my car on the road. It was near Dun Laoghaire and near Killiney Hill for walks. I was very happy to have my own ensuite with the bedroom. It's nice to be able to make a cup of tea in the evening, thanks! I hope to return."
261248,551570475,10/20/2019,"Great value, hearty breakfast and local knowledge"

266654,469305457,6/14/2019,Cosy and comfortable room. Joanne was very helpful and answered all my questions. The location is great as the bus stopping outside goes directly to the city centre. I would highly recommend staying with Joanne.
266654,473903243,6/22/2019,"What a sweet host Joanne is! she's very welcoming, warm and her smiley face made me smile too. also, she let me do early check-in and late check-out which was really helpful for me to manage my plans. the room I used was a little small but the bed is super comfy, the view through the window is nice and didn't have any problems staying there. highly recommended! will def. wanna come back Joanne's if I have chance to come back to Dublin."
266654,483144711,7/7/2019,The room is comfortable and clean. It's a great option for staying a few days while you visit Dublin.

266654,526018532,9/8/2019,This was an awesome and very worth stay in Dublin! The place was nice and tidy and Joanne was extremely welcoming. I would highly recommend bringing coin Euro to get on the easy bus ride right outside to the city. Not worth taking a taxi when the bus is under 3 euro. Will definitely be coming back here if I am in Dublin again!
266654,534939412,9/23/2019,"Nice, quiet area quite close to the airport. Joanne has been very nice, warm and helpful host."

266856,423510010,3/14/2019,"We loved our stay at Brian and Phyllis's bed and breakfast. The location was perfect for us-- just a short Dart ride (train) from downtown Dublin. Beautiful and picturesque waterfront, very near to the James Joyce Tower and Museum. We enjoyed our strolls by the water and checking out the local pub. Our room itself was very comfortable and clean. Will definitely stay again!"
266856,426553211,3/21/2019,Very nice hosts and a very comfortable stay :)

266856,513934167,8/20/2019,"Brian and Phyllis are wonderful hosts, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  My son enjoyed talking to Phyllis about Zambia and loved his breakfast which was very filling.  Would definitely recommend them and cant wait to go back."
266856,515806616,8/23/2019,A nice clean comfortable quiet place. Close to the Dart to get to the city of Dublin. I would go back again if going back to Dublin.
266856,524548426,9/6/2019,Bring your own toiletries and hairdryer.
266856,555900442,10/28/2019,Unfortunately we were not comfortable at this bed and breakfast. The pictures are misleading. The room is tiny. There is literally 6ù between the one side of the bed and the fireplace. The bathroom is tiny and is really a shower room. Without the picture of the bathroom you truly dont know what you are getting. I could not say that this is an Award winning bed and breakfastù. It is definitely not up to our standards and we are not 4 star people. You can book a nice hotel in Dublin for roughly the same cost. I would recommend that you do this instead of staying here.
275425,425528881,3/18/2019,"This was the best experience that I had with airbnb ever. Chriss and Emma were the best hosts even if we couldn't meet personally. A couple of days before our stay, they sent me all the information that we needed about the house and the city. When we arrived to the place, they had food and drinks for us, and also a map of the city and everything that we needed. The house was perfect, and we absolutely enjoy our stay. I definitely recommend them! Thank you so much and I hope to come back for the next St Patrick's weekend."
275425,482998029,7/7/2019,"A wonderful home in close proximity to the city center. My family and I met Chris during our stay - he was kind, helpful and the perfect host. If youre thinking about booking this Airbnb, I highly recommend it. Thank you Emma and Chris for opening your home to my family!"
292757,421311358,3/9/2019,Sarah was a wonderful host.  Great communication.  Lovey home.  Highly recommend.
292757,421856424,3/10/2019,"Spacious and luxurious space, perfect for a break in Dublin, dont plan too much for your trip as you might not want to leave the house! Very comfortable beds."
292757,423149978,3/13/2019,"There arent enough words to describe how amazing The Stables and Sarah are.  Sarah is the the host all hosts should model themselves after.  

The accommodations were cozy and perfect for what me and my friends were looking for.  

Absolute perfection!"
292757,429596160,3/28/2019,"Lisa and I loved Sarahs place, perfect spot in Dublin"
292757,431993016,4/2/2019,"A really wonderful space near Phoenix Park, Zoo, Downtown and airport with absolutely wonderful hosts. The house is spacious and worked wonderfully for our group of 8 including 4 children.  Sarah really went above and beyond to help us out.  Highly recommend."
292757,436094701,4/12/2019,"Sarah was an exceptional host, and the property was a truly special space! Fantastic communication, gorgeous grounds, amazing pool, incredible and historic location.  AirBnb at its best.  If youre traveling to Dublin and want to experience something special, this is the place.  We hope to return soon! Thanks so much Sarah, youre an AirBnb rockstar!"
292757,437094907,4/14/2019,"I stayed at Sarah's in a group of six to celebrate my friend's hen do in Dublin for one night over the weekend. I expected it to be lovely based on the photos and previous reviews, and our stay exceeded expecations! The home is absolutely stunning, and Sarah went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and felt at home, from allowing us to check in  early as we had a very early flight when we arrived, to taking our bags to the airport to meet us the next evening so we didn't have to carry them around with us after checking out. She also offered us lifts whenever possible into the city and offered us discount vouchers for attractions we visited. Sarah's own home is separate from the guest house but she was available if ever we needed anything. She also has some gorgoeus dogs we met which was a plus :)  
The home along with the pool and sauna really felt luxurious and Sarah is a truly kind host so I would absolutely not hesitate to book here. One of the best airbnb experiences. 

Thanks again x"
292757,439632566,4/19/2019,"If we could give 6 out of 5 Stars we would. The place was absolutely spectacular from start to finish. Clean, homey, and thoughtful. Sarah was the most delightful host from a welcome when we landed to making sure we had everything we needed. We wish she could run every Airbnb."
292757,441680278,4/22/2019,Lovely peaceful location if your looking to be away from the busy centre. Relaxing environment
292757,443598546,4/26/2019,Excellence in all aspects
292757,445415384,4/29/2019,"Sarah and her property are a rare find in todays world. Her warmth is matched only by her home at the Stables. This picturesque Irish property is in a quaint and quiet neighborhood right next to a park with many activities. Sarah aims to please and treats her guests akin to her lovely family. The three things that I find most important in an AirB&B are: the
 bed, shower pressure, and the cleanliness of the apartment. All three are exceptional in this lovely home. Not only does Sarah provide a lovely place but she also has a wealth of knowledge of Dublin. It was a privilege to meet Sarah, her family (including the dogs) and stay in her AirB&B."
292757,446440352,5/1/2019,if you want a taste of heaven in dublin this is the place as you have a serene environment with a heated pool and sauna next to a wonderful park and great hosts in a lovely setting inside and out in a historic renovation
292757,447366803,5/3/2019,There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.....however I will add that I am a repeat visitor to Sarah's wonderful home.  The first was with my family in July 2017 and now with three friends for a week of golf.  Sarah's home was as fantastic as ever but it is her excellent communication and friendly and warm hospitality that sets her and this property apart.  I showed my wife and kids the pictures I took and now they want to go back and stay in Sarah's home again.  I have stayed in quite a few AirBnB properties and this one stands out above all the rest.  We will be back!
292757,449289568,5/6/2019,Sarah was a fantastic host with such an amazing house. Very accommodating and there for anything we needed. Would definitely recommend this property!
292757,451278296,5/11/2019,Sarahs home is huge and lovely. The four of us stayed on the upper level with the living room and kitchen   We had everything we needed to fix quick meals   The beds were so comfortable. The water pressure was great. We did not use the pool or the sauna but they were available to us.  We felt very secure and safe.
292757,451869726,5/12/2019,"Wow! Amazing stay for my birthday with a few of my friends. From the get go, Sarah was so welcoming with her very friendly dogs. She even added balloons & processo! Really thoughtful touches. Bed was so comfortable and had an amazing sleep, pool & sauna area is perfect. Pricy but very well worth it. Would 100% recommend to friends x"
292757,454453502,5/18/2019,Sarah was the sweetest! She is a magnificent host and makes you feel at home. I would stay there a hundred times more. Her Air Bnb was the cleanest place I have stayed and the quaintest. She went above and beyond for us and I am forever grateful. Thank you for making our trip spectacular.
292757,457466858,5/24/2019,"Sarah is the most hospitable, warm and wonderful host we have ever experienced! The property is absolutely GORGEOUS and is so conveniently located. It accommodated our family of 8 so perfectly.  Our stay was nothing short of perfect! Sarah is personable and kind. Very helpful with anything we needed. Perfection !!"
292757,462829104,6/2/2019,1 A location!
292757,464661692,6/6/2019,"Easily the best airbnb stay and host I've ever had.  The location is removed enough from Dublin to feel peaceful and relaxed, but still accessible.  The close proximity of the park was a big draw to us, and the home itself is top notch.  The best part of the experience however is the host. Sarah is one of the kindest people, and her dogs add yet more charm to an already top-notch stay."
292757,467960619,6/11/2019,"Sarah was a great host.  We really appreciated that she was there to meet us when we arrived.  The home was very clean, cozy and comfortable."
292757,469351976,6/14/2019,"Our visit to Sarah's home was truly memorable and beyond our expectations!  Our family filled each room and all were delighted with their accommodations.  But most of all, we were impressed with Sarah's hospitality from beginning to end, including wine and cheese by the fire after a day of touring.  It is a lovely place in a great location, and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin."
292757,472215296,6/19/2019,This place is a must stay! Sarah was a great host. Sarahs house is close to town and the airport. I highly recommend this place!
292757,473865241,6/22/2019,"Sarahs home is an urban oasis in an ideal location. The house is next door to Phoenix Park. Given the proximity to the park, and Sarahs nature-friendly landscaping, it is almost as if you are in country retreat. When you want to go to town, jump in a cab and soon you will be in the midst of Dublin. When you want to some peace and quiet, it is a quick trip back to a spacious house in which the old and new have been tastefully blended to create a welcoming living space. The beds are comfortable, the showers have plenty of space and hot water, and the house is hospital clean. Truly a home away from home.  

And, Sarah is friendly host who genuinely wants her guest to enjoy their stay. From her first welcome to the time you leave, Sarah goes out of her way to make sure that guests are doing well and getting what they want out of Dublin. The combination of Sarah and the house make for a pleasant and memorable experience. Highly recommended!"
292757,482237675,7/6/2019,"Sarah was a thoughtful, gracious host.  The location was fantastic and wouldn't of asked for anything more."
292757,484758635,7/9/2019,"Sarah was amazing, from restaurant reviews to sharing her familys Irish history, she was so welcoming.  The place is amazing and very different from other places.  Beautiful comfortable bedrooms and the location right next to the park is great for late afternoon walks and an easy cab ride/drive into center Dublin.  Highly recommend!"
292757,486969657,7/13/2019,Sarah's place was the highlight of our trip. We got a warm welcome from Sarah after a long day of travel from Kinsale. The rooms were sparkling clean and the place was outfitted with everything we needed. It fit all nine of us comfortably. The kids loved the pool and the sauna was perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The location is perfect - just on the doorsteps of Phoenix Park (perfect for a morning walk) and easy access to Dublin. Our only regret was not staying longer. Sarah's place is one of the best AirBnB properties we've stayed in.
292757,489172074,7/16/2019,Excellent stay.  Sarah is an amazing host.  All needs met.  Strongly suggested.
292757,491484274,7/20/2019,"Our family of 7 expected Sarah's place to be a highlight of our travels around Ireland, and it exceeded our hopes!  Her hospitality was stellar; she was so very welcoming and responsive to our needs. We enjoyed everything: the lovely rooms, beautiful courtyard bursting with flowers, peaceful and handy location, recommendations for places to eat and visit, AND of course, the pool and sauna.  It's so important to sleep well and get refreshed, during the intensity of travel, and this place more than filled the bill.  We enjoyed laughs and good conversation with Sarah and her husband, in between touring the great city of Dublin.  Anybody who gets to stay at The Stables is lucky indeed."
292757,493416631,7/22/2019,Wonderful accommodations in an excellent location. Whole family was very gracious and helpful. Great way to experience Ireland.
292757,499971569,8/1/2019,"What word sums up Super Sarah? Wow? Awesome? Fantabulous? All of those and more.   She begins as your host and continues on to becoming your friend.
Thank you so much Sarah (and Michael and sons) for making our week with you so memorable. We will certainly return, all being well."
292757,503740095,8/6/2019,"Full of character, inspiring relaxation, comfortable, spacious, with exceptional perks (loved the pool with its cathedral ceiling, and the Island feel of the courtyard).  Phoenix park as a neighbour was an added bonus, with great walks, and biking trails.  Sarah was a great host!  Recommend highly.

Brynn, Sean, and Kevin"
292757,505380826,8/9/2019,We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's place. The property is unique and beautiful. Sarah and her family are so kind and we enjoyed chatting with them. The pool was a big hit with my family. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Dublin.
292757,509296777,8/14/2019,Great for a large family.  It is very quiet and the space is very comfortable.
292757,510669536,8/16/2019,"Gorgeous accommodation, friendly hosts! Right on Phoenix Park within easy walking distance of a couple of great pubs. We only stayed one night but thoroughly enjoyed the space. Would recommend."
292757,515811731,8/23/2019,Unique place to stay! Hosts are amazing. Great for extended families with four bedrooms and room for all. Having the indoor pool was a great twist when you have a young family.
292757,519907160,8/29/2019,The Old World Stableyard is an incredible oasis from bustling Dublin and is as breathtaking as the pictures show. The sauna and indoor pool offer a wonderful way to rejuvenate after a long day of enjoying the unique opportunities the area offers. Beds are comfortable and the place is very clean. The kitchen living space is a nice gathering spot and you can kick up the entertainment more in the area where the pool table is located. My favorite spot was out in the courtyard sitting at the patio table enjoying the views and serenity while relaxing. Great place to stay! Highly recommend it!
292757,522592604,9/2/2019,Great location and beautiful space! You will not be disappointed if you chose this home for your group!
292757,524170033,9/5/2019,"Exceptional,quiet yet a quick cab ride to the city.  Would stay again."
292757,525877021,9/8/2019,"The Stables at Castleknock are simply exquisite!

The arent enough words to describe this elegant yet comfortable airbnb. Sarah was the most welcoming and interactive host weve encountered - in the best ways possible.

The bedrooms are comfortable and roomy. The kitchen and tv room are cozy. Some of us took advantage of the pool, sauna, and game room. 

The location is perfect, just outside Phoenix Park. Its a lovely area :  safe, clean, upscale. We took taxis to and from town, for a cost of about ‚Ç¨20 each way.

You can see why this place was named Irelands Most Unique Airbnb Location of 2016!

Just a splendid holiday for all!"
292757,526793061,9/9/2019,"The place was just as described and Sarah was an amazing host, friendly, welcoming and helpful"
292757,528020774,9/12/2019,extraordinary space with elegant touches.  Fabulous location and warm and inviting host.
292757,529943451,9/15/2019,"Sarahs home is gorgeous, comfortable, luxurious & spotlessly clean. Its in a fantastic location beside the park and ideal for a group of close friends or family. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & made the most of the lovely facilities on offer at this great home. Thanks Sarah & family for your hospitality & kindness."
292757,533837714,9/22/2019,A must stay if you are coming to Dublin. With Phoenix Park in your back garden and a swimming pool and sauna this is ultimate place to relax.

292757,537926656,9/29/2019,"Sarah was on hand to give us a guided tour of the property when we arrived, which is beautiful. Very peaceful area and the park on the doorstep was a real treat. Sarah told us about a great taxi app which actually works!! It was perfect for a group of ladies celebrating a birthday. I would recommend this place to others."
292757,543245510,10/7/2019,"What a great property - highly recommend!  We loved everything about it.  It was clean, spacious, and incredibly comfortable.  Was such a great start to our vacation, especially after long flights to get there.  The sauna was exactly what we needed after a long day of travel!  Sarah goes above and beyond to ensure you are taken care of.  We had some problems with our rental car and Sarah was incredibly helpful.  Just can't say enough about Sarah and her beautiful property!"
292757,546223012,10/13/2019,"This place was everything I had hoped for. Sarah is an amazing host - she drove us to dinner, took us to the grocery store and even offered to pick up our Mom and Aunt if they got too tired on one of our day trips. She is truly a nice person and really made us feel warm and welcome. The space is beautiful and very safe.  My husband and Brother in Law used her husband's and son's clubs for a day of golf which was super nice of  them. I'm not sure my husband would lend out his clubs to strangers, but I thank them for allowing that. Thank you for making our stay in Ireland even better! You will not be disappointed if you choose this AirBNB for your visit to Dublin."
292757,551452343,10/20/2019,"I would tell anyone, The Stables in Dublin with Sarah as you super hostess is one of the Best experiences you can have. The site is one of a kind, located in a beautiful part of Castleknock, next to Phoenix Park.  The hostess Sarah is exceptional. She is extremely knowledgeable but more importantly is a kind person who makes you feel at home."
292757,552243033,10/21/2019,"An absolutely perfect and relaxing space for our last night in Ireland! Super comfortable beds, tons of movies to choose from, and everything else you could need. Sarah was a very helpful and accommodating host. We will be back for a longer stay!"

292757,555975002,10/28/2019,"Sarah's place is a fabulous house. She is a great host , helpful and responsive.  A good social space for guests without being on top of one another . Definitely one to consider for large groups travelling."
292757,556423342,10/29/2019,"The outstanding hospitality we received here sets the bar high for Ireland. We immediately felt as though we were part of the family, and the Airbnb itself was unbelievable. Definitely stay here if you have the chance!"
292757,557095767,10/31/2019,This is an awesome place to stay. We can not say enough great things about it. You will not be disappointed if you stay here. We can hardly wait to come back.
292757,561430034,11/9/2019,"Sarah is an outstanding host, offering to pick up groceries and provide an occasional lift to Castleknock Village. She and her family were the perfect guides for things to do and see in Dublin! Phoenix Park is an amazing place just a half a block away. The Castleknock restaurants-especially Castello Bruno were incredible! We enjoyed the sauna and the location is just a quick cab ride to major attractions!! I recommend you stay here with family and friends to enjoy the magic & charm of Dublin!"
292757,563252967,11/12/2019,"I cannot speak highly enough about Sarah and her beautiful home. Our flight landing time was outside of check-in time, and she welcomed us with tea and conversation. The rooms are so comfortable. As silly as it seems, the water pressure was note-worthy. We stayed in many hotels and BnBs over the course of our honeymoon travels, and the water pressure here was phenomenal in comparison. The space is absolutely gorgeous as well. We will absolutely be back. Sarah is by far the best host we have ever had, and she is a genuinely wonderful person."
292757,565331438,11/17/2019,"A fabulous night away, location, space and amenities were perfect for our weekend and the hosts were just so welcoming. Its easily accessible from the main roads and airport and a short trip into the city centre. 
Were already planning on booking for next year! Thanks again for a lovely stay."
302554,463378417,6/3/2019,Great location. Free on street parking was a huge bonus. Very close to Lidl and Tesco. Walking distance to Phoenix Park.
302554,469219499,6/14/2019,A cozy flat with everything equipped and Fiona was very helpful and gave us some travel tips. Easy to access and highly recommended.
302554,470666545,6/16/2019,Great apartment and close enough to town to walk. I would recommend
302554,475516780,6/24/2019,"Liam and Fiona's place was the perfect base for us and our two kids.  It was clean, had everything we needed, and was in a good spot near Phoenix park and bus lines straight to the city."
302554,517177131,8/25/2019,"Very nice appartment, not too far from the center (30 min walk) in a nice and quiet neighbourhood."
302554,535818055,9/25/2019,"Liam and Fionas place was great with everything we needed. It was a short 5-10 minute walk from 2 grocery stores, the trendy neighborhood of Stoneybatter, and Phoenix Park. The buses get you into the core of the city in 15 minutes, or its a 30-40 minute walk. Liam and Fiona were super responsive and helpful. Take them up on their offer of arranging a ride from the airport for more local tips. We had a lovely time!"
302634,456367291,5/21/2019,Accogliente confortevole e pulito. Il centro si raggiunge in circa 15 minuti a piedi.
302634,457140052,5/23/2019,A quiet place to stay and very clean.
302634,468863912,6/13/2019,"We had a great stay at Liam and Fiona's place. The studio is well located, safe and quiet and not far away from the city center. Liam and Fiona are wonderful hosts, available, kind and helpful."
302634,482294050,7/6/2019,"Lovely clean place to stay and excellent bus service right outside.
If you miss the last bus back and get the tram make sure you get your bearings right or like us you could end up walking half way back into Dublin city centre before realising"
302634,538805009,9/30/2019,"Great place. Really comfortable location. Clean, warm and relaxing place."
315698,422576851,3/11/2019,"Traceys location was perfect for me. A lovely and quiet spot far enough outside of the city, but with a very doable walk into downtown Dublin. Extremely comfortable space, and Tracey was second to none in regards to local suggestions and travel advice. All the things she recommended after assessing my personal taste were both my favorite memories as well as things I probably would have missed if I was solely planning on my own.

I was going to do more bouncing around the country with single, overnight stays, but realized how much easier it would be do just do single day tour bus trips from Dublin to the west and the north. If youre not going to rent a car, this is the best way to maximize your time as you can really hit any part of this country and back in a single day. 

However you go, Traceys home is great and I would definitely stay here again if I was back in Dublin."
315698,427967377,3/24/2019,"I think this host will be great for needy travellers but not for independent minded or business travellers. She sent at least 36 messages plus several phone calls in a 4 day span, and was a bit obsessive with the entire process from even before I left my home. 

The nagging started before Id even arrived in Dublin. I arrived to her home about an hour late, because I had missed a stop, and had to order and wait for a taxi - that took about half an hour. She might think my tardiness was enough justification for continuing to nag. I dont. 

I also felt that she spoke down at me upon arrival. For example, she felt it was necessary to teach me how to use an elevator (she did that speaking really slowly, as though I might be unintelligent and need that kind of support). Then mentioned in a condescending tone that I might be directionally challenged, so guided me through her hallway in a step by step super patronizing fashion."
315698,431548004,4/1/2019,Prima ruimte. De locatie ligt aan de oostkant van Dublin en is met de bus vanuit het vliegveld goed er bereiken. Ook in de avond geen enkel probleem.
315698,435704001,4/11/2019,"Tracey is a lovely and helpful host, quick to react to questions, ready to help you out if needed. The carpeted bedroom and en suite bathroom are clean, you get towels, a great duvet, there's a fridge, an iron,... (But no microwave or tv)The little balcony is a great add on. There are some shops and public transport close by. So in all a good choice for a trip to Dublin!"
315698,437898277,4/15/2019,"The room was clean and large; the flat was in a nice location: not too far from city centre in a safe area; Tracey was excellent and friendly and provided us with advice on bars and restaurants etc.; we had a great stay in Dublin! 

Would thoroughly recommend this place for others."
315698,456345218,5/21/2019,"Tracey was incredibly friendly and welcoming. On the first night, I had managed to leave my phone in the taxi, and I had no idea what to do. Tracey, though,  knew exactly what to do and helped me get my phone back. In addition to that, Tracey provided lots of great recommendations for eating and hanging out. I'll definitely stay with her again if I'm back in Dublin :)"
315698,459415143,5/27/2019,"Our stay in Traceys apartment was great. Communication was easy via the Airbnb app. The room is spacious and cosy. Tracey provided a lot of local tips to us. Moreover, she kindly offered some free drinks as well."
315698,467516218,6/10/2019,Very clean place. Tracy is a nice and very friendly host. We can recommend staying at her place!
315698,470571103,6/16/2019,"This place is in a great location. You can get to many bus stops and the dart so you can make it anywhere you need. Tracey absolutely knows what's she's doing, communicates extremely well and quickly, and had the best suggestions! The room is a great size for 1 or 2. Has everything you need, but be aware: no microwave. Otherwise, perfect stay!"
315698,478079190,6/29/2019,"Traceys place was fantastic!  Great location, wonderful accommodations, very friendly and helpful host. Would definitely rent again!!"
315698,488506838,7/15/2019,"I stayed at Traceys place for a week and it was perfect. Very close to all the action of the city but with a nice quiet place to relax and sleep at. The room, balcony and private bath are excellent. Tracey is extremely helpful with travel tips and suggestions for not only Dublin but throughout all of Ireland. She responds to messages thru the app very promptly. The bed was comfortable. Theres a nice large desk for working on planning your travel days. The bathroom is very nice with a shower with great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The WiFi signal is really strong and consistent. Theres a grocery store right around the corner and a small refrigerator in the room to keep your things cold. She provided some nice extras like coffee and tea, along with cereal, chips and other snacks. The bus # 1 or 47 stops right outside the door and takes you right into town in a few minutes. The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) train station is a short walk away. I highly suggest taking it to the Howth station on the coast and walking the cliff walk. Not strenuous at all and the views are breath taking. Id also suggest buying the Visitor Leap Card for the number of days youre there. I bought the 7 day one and used it to and from the airport and all places in between. The LUAS (tram) station is also a short walk away and can take you to town or straight to the Heuston Rail station if you need to catch a long distance train. All in all, this was one of the best AirBnBs Ive ever stayed at and for the price, especially in Dublin, you cant beat it. If I ever come back to Dublin, which I hope I do, Ill definitely stay here again. Other travel tips - see the Book of Kells, take the Musical Pub Crawl, do a day trip to Glendalough and Kilkenny, do a day trip to the Giants Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, and Belfast. Theres just so much to see in and around Dublin and Traceys is the place you want to stay at to enjoy it all!"
315698,491634611,7/20/2019,"Absolutely amazing! The room is lovely and huge, and there is everything you need available, from a fridge to a balcony and comfy bed.  But the best part is Tracey, who is so hospitable!  She gave me tons of travel tips, and even some fruit to take along on a daytrip! She is a wonderful (Website hidden by Airbnb) like staying with a friend!  Great space, great host, and great value....You will love your stay!"
315698,496450171,7/27/2019,"Traceys room was spacey and decorated with so much style and love. I had everything I needed and more including a comfy bed, working space, a great view from a balcony and even a mini fridge in the room. The room was super clean, the communication was quick, easy and always super friendly. It has a bus stop nearby but everything is easily accessible by foot as well. Would recommend it without hesitation."
315698,507995304,8/12/2019,"We stayed at Traceys for 4 nights over the weekend and absolutely loved it! She is an amazing host, welcomed us in the street when we arrived later in the evening and had written down many useful and detailed tips for things to do in the city. She made us feel right at home. The room itself is very comfortable and clean and tidy and has everything you need if youre not planning on cooking dinner for yourself at night. We were more than happy with the fridge and kettle. It was very private, in fact we didnt see Tracey again at all after check-in as shes working a lot. The location is great, its a quiet, pretty neighbourhood. We never took the bus and instead walked to and from the city centre, which usually took us about 20-30 minutes. It was lovely. We can wholeheartedly recommend Traceys place and would definitely stay again ourselves."
315698,511455224,8/17/2019,"Lovely bright large room. Super friendly and helpful host.
Great location, not central but close to many area that we wouldn't have seen had we stayed in central Dublin. 
Brown's cafe in Sandymount is a gem.
Thanks Tracey!!"
315698,528093409,9/12/2019,"This place is in a great location, central to everything but very quiet. The host is friendly and very helpful. Highly recommended."
315698,532752572,9/20/2019,"Lovely place, lovely tot .. I felt like I was at family"
315698,535382458,9/24/2019,"This place was awesome. Tracey is super helpful, the grocery downstairs is very convenient, and we had everything we needed. It was a short walk to downtown and in a very nice area."
315698,538048570,9/29/2019,"Tracey is absolutely fantastic. Located in South Dublin, it is walking distance to city Center. Whats nice is that its a straight shot down one street from one end to the other to walk through the heart of Dublin.

Everything was as listed, highly recommend."
315698,541454973,10/5/2019,"Tracy excels in the market of AirBnB and made me feel welcomed. 
There really are no complaints. Great location, great tips, comfortable, quiet,  and adequate amenities."
315698,547856742,10/16/2019,"I had an amazing stay at Tracey's place. The communication was spot on and the location and guidance from her was perfect. The apartment is on a main road and quite visible anyway.
The checkin was super smooth, and Tracey was very flexible with my late checkin.
Coming to the room, it is very spacious , sparkling clean and very cosy. Almost everything that you need for a great stay is available in the room itself. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend Tracey's place, it is in a prime location with great connectivity."
315698,556749761,10/30/2019,"Spacious, clean, room. Loved that the bathroom was ensuite. 
Tracey was very nice giving me some suggestions of what to do, and where to go. Didn't see her again after check-in.
The small frig was nice, as I kept some cheese and crackers to munch on.
Great location if you are spending the day, out and about. It is about a 35-40min walk to city center. So no bouncing back and forth during the day. It is close to bus stops, if you are comfortable with using public transportation. 
Would recommend this space."
333950,429580142,3/28/2019,We had a perfect stay at Daragh and Edward's place. The house is in a very nice area and really close to the city centre. They gave us a lot of tips on Dublin and they were very kind and friendly! Definitely recommended :)
333950,432879668,4/5/2019,"Daragh and Edgar were superb hosts with excellent recommendations for what to do while in Dublin. My friend and I were only in town for two nights, but with Daragh and Edgars help we were able to make the most of it! The guest room is cozy, and the terrace is so lovely. You really cant beat being walking distance from everything! My friend and I used transit only once, and that was because of the rain, not the distance."
333950,435784961,4/11/2019,"They gave us so much information and help in so many ways. Just amazing. Their house is also just walks away from anything and everything. I highly recommend even sitting down to talk about anything, truly a good time!"
333950,450403169,5/9/2019,"Great location, warm hosts!  I think this listing is perfect for one person, but it may feel tight for two people, depending on how you use it.  If you're comfortable lounging in the shared living spaces, or if the weather permits using the amazing private balcony, then two people would be comfortable.  Overall, I definitely recommend staying here!"
333950,453272110,5/15/2019,"Pretty small house and in quite location, near nightlife and historical interesting places. We love the terrace where we can view the classic dubliner roofs. :)

333950,453941182,5/17/2019,Daragh is a wonderful host. We appreciated his hospitality.  He showed  us places to go and where to eat.  The room is lovely with a little deck off of the room. His place is in an amazing location near all the special places to see while in Dublin.
333950,455095920,5/19/2019,"We had a awesome time there, it felt like home. The location was perfect, close to everything. The host was incredibly nice, gave us tipps and breakfast. He was very welcoming and helped with everything he could.

365854,435755106,4/11/2019,"Really nice 
Thanks to Diane for her reactivity and help"
365854,440713231,4/21/2019,"This was a perfect apartment for my solo trip to Dublin. Its a great location, about a 15 minute walk from the temple bar area and right next to a bus stop. The apartment was very clean and felt safe. Diane was very quick to communicate and help if I had any questions about Dublin or the apartment."
365854,447234750,5/3/2019,Diane's place was as described. High quality fittings throughout with a very nice interior design. I would describe this apartment as luxury. It is located very centrally and quiet secure. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends.
365854,450440790,5/9/2019,"A well-located, stylish small apartment."
365854,455095840,5/19/2019,"Highly recommended. 
Functional and nice apartment."
365854,457555029,5/24/2019,Stayed again at Diane's place as it is convenient and she is very amenable. The apartment is very comfortable and secure. Due to being on a main street it can be a little noisy at night or with the morning rush hour traffic. Not a problem if you need to be up and about early. I would still continue to recommend this place though.
365854,461380687,5/31/2019,"Stayed again at this place as it is comfortable, clean, great location and secure. I've found Diane as a host to be very flexible within reason with good communications throughout. Will continue to book when there is availability and I'm visiting / working in the city."
365854,463910001,6/4/2019,We loved Dianes apartment. It was very stylish and the location was great. We recommend this place and Diane was a great host. We simply loved everything.
365854,464763897,6/6/2019,"Stay regularly at Diane's place when working in Dublin. Great host,  who although is away, ensures everything is organised before your arrival. She has an excellent assistant who meets & greets and provides an overview of the apartment. Highly valued."
365854,467285980,6/10/2019,Clean and tidy flat and quite central
365854,469314692,6/14/2019,"Diane is a wonderful host.  She not only responds quickly for any questions, she will check in with you to be sure all is well.  Her apartment is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, comfortable and secure.  I would not hesitate staying there again."
365854,471399226,6/17/2019,Nice place in good location about 15 minutes from Temple Bar. Diane is easy to communicate with and the apartment is nice and clean.
365854,473330951,6/21/2019,Very stylish flat and very clean. Not far from the centre and corner shop opposite flat is very convenient. Would 100% recommend staying here.
365854,478057795,6/29/2019,"Diane's home is a nicely furnished, clean and comfortable place and Diane is a very nice and caring hostess. The location of the apartment is quite okay regarding getting there from the airport, with plenty of supermarkets around to buy groceries. There are also coffee shops and pubs nearby to go for a coffee or a beer and the street is quite busy with people and traffic, but not particularly noisy. It was also easy to commute from the apartment to other parts of the city and all the main attractions are at only around 15 minutes walk away. I warmly recommend staying in Diane's home, especially if you are a neat person yourself! Thank you very much for all your help <3"
365854,489148793,7/16/2019,"Dianes apartment was the perfect place to stay in Dublin. Very centrally locates, you can walk to just about any part of the city. Dianes place was spotlessly clean with several nice touches. One thing that my wife and I most appreciated was a short itinerary Diane had prepared to help us get accommodated to the city. Highly recommend staying at here BnB."
365854,500491174,8/2/2019,Stayed at Dianes place for two weeks as a base while I was working in Dublin. Spotless and facilities were as it said on the tin and worked well for me - and close to a Luas stop so getting around was easy. Would recommend to those who need a base in Dublin for a long weekend etc.
365854,507054471,8/11/2019,"Great option to stay in Diane's charming apartment.
The apartment has enough items to make quick meals.
Excellent location, close to shops, easy access, to get around with all of transport nearby.
We were very pleased!"
365854,529222642,9/14/2019,"The apartment is very well furnished, every detail is thought through."
365854,533858083,9/22/2019,Very stylish and nice place to stay in Dublin.
365854,537279549,9/28/2019,"Staying at Diane's was a pleasure. She was unable to greet me, but her neighbour was able to help out to get me on property and show me the apartment. Though Diane was travelling abroad at the time of my stay, she was easy to get in touch with and even did the occasional check in with me to make sure I had everything I needed. 

The apartment was clean and cozy. The building itself is secure and safe.

Being so close to O'Connell Street was a huge plus as it is the central hub of sorts to get to anywhere you need to go! Diane also has a binder full of ideas for things to do!"
365854,549905362,10/18/2019,"Such a beautiful property.. extremely clean, stylish and cozy. I would highly recommend this property as its for a good value, near the city center and gives you a great experience in Dublin. I loved it!"
365854,553995773,10/25/2019,"I stayed in Diane's apartment for a week.  Her apartment is very conveniently located to catch multiple buses that took me everywhere I wanted to go in the city!  The 123 bus stop is right out the front door and a number of other bus stops are within 3-4 blocks from the apartment (including the stop for the very affordable Airlink bus). The apartment is a large building near a number of mostly Asian restaurants and grocery/convenient stores.  I had 2 very good meals from places on the same street as the building.  The apartment building is very secure with 3 doors to get the main hallway.  Inside the apartment, the decorations are as in the photos.  The kitchen has all of the basics (I cooked 3x). The bed was comfortable and the bathroom/shower was spacious enough. Water pressure was good once I got the hang of the system.  The living room sofa was very comfortable, especially after such a long day of being a tourist.  Others have  noted the street noise.  It honestly didn't bother me at all since there was nothing excessive or too disruptive.  Diane was always very responsive to any questions and was very welcoming. Overall, I thought this was a safe, convenient, and good place to stay at while exploring Dublin!"
365854,556424824,10/29/2019,Beautiful clean apartment. Felt like we were staying in a nice hotel.
365854,561934783,11/10/2019,"The apartment is gorgeous, located in the city center. It's a fabolous pied a terre. Diane was SUPER kind to me, I've spent 10 days in Dublin and I truly recommend her"
374792,446816217,5/2/2019,"This was a lovely clean comfortable place to stay and it met all out needs, the local shops and pubs are all on your doorstep and we had great craic in he Black Lion pub. Macari's chippy across the road make the best chips I have ever tasted and we kept going back for more. Bus stop is just outside the door but we found that if there is three people then a taxi is just as cheap and much quicker. I had no need to call the host during our stay because everything was great and just as described. Loved our stay."
374792,478647709,6/30/2019,super great! recommended
386860,481271335,7/4/2019,Our family loved this home. It was everything and more.  From the roll top bath to the espresso coffee machine and little sun trap garden ! The atmosphere in the morning walk and contrast warm evenings along canal ! Beautiful.
386860,482426678,7/6/2019,Would highly recommend staying at Sineads house. It is perfect location and also Sinead is a fantastic host.
386860,483220008,7/7/2019,"Fabulous, clean and quirky! Great location and very friendly host. Would highly recommend and can't wait to come back and stay again."
386860,486793917,7/13/2019,"What a wonderful place! Right on the canal, beautiful quiet neighborhood close to everything. We walked everywhere, it was so easy. I highly recommend it! There is an awesome bakery around the corner. The place is clean and the beds are super comfortable. Sinead is an awesome host! Ask her about the Leapfrog corkscrew interactive host/ traveler challenge :) I will definitely come back!"
386860,489280903,7/16/2019,"In a word this unit is ""rustic"". For a three or four 20-something friends, this place would be great. You could hang out along the canal together,  save money on meals by cooking together and so on. My university students would have made the most of this unit. The host was very nice and a clear communicator. Had the description been a bit more accurate, I would have likely opted to spend a few more dollars for my mother and I to stay in a hotel."
386860,495078456,7/25/2019,We had a great stay in Sineads house and really missed nothing.  It has a warm atmosphere and is really good lokated to walk to the town center.
386860,497283776,7/28/2019,Great location in a quiet area. Easy 30 minute walk into down townù area.
386860,507261059,8/11/2019,"Sinead's cottage is a fab place to stay for a trip to Dublin. Situated in the Portobello area of the city, there are many shops, cafe's bars and pubs in walking distance. The popular areas of Camden Street and Harcourt Street are a 10 minute walk away and it took us about 30 minutes to walk into the centre of the city to Temple Bar. The Cottage is clean, modern and spacious however it retains its character. It had all the amenities we needed for a long weekend away.  Sinead was excellent at providing us details such as how to get to the cottage from the airport, how to check in and where to find things in the cottage. She also helped us arrange to leave our suitcases there after check out as we weren't flying until late in the evening. I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone who is looking for a stay in Dublin. It was close enough to walk to the tourist areas, yet far enough from the central areas of Temple Bar and Grafton Street that we felt we experienced the real Dublin."
386860,513293011,8/19/2019,"Things that were great: location was awesome, Sinead's responsiveness was great. Quiet neighbourhood. 

Things that couldn't be avoided: key to get in was not turning properly, Sinead was there in 5 minutes to get it sorted out. Biggest issue - fire alarm went off every 30 minutes from 645 in the morning until we left that morning. Luckily Sinead answered and got us the code but was annoying nonetheless but unavoidable I think, just one of those things. 

Why not a 5 star: some basic things were missing - baking sheets in particular, instructions to run the oven (in general, the oven is not our style, old school and takes forever to heat up and cool down; we cook a lot so would be helpful to know from the outset), instructions for the radiator (we're spoiled and like it warmer and especially with an infant), in general the place was a little 'cottage' which I guess fits with the title, but I think we missed the mark in our booking, and should've gotten something more modern with more modern amenities. 

In general, the place was very nice, Sinead's responsiveness was second to none, the place just wasn't our style."
386860,515119819,8/22/2019,"Location was good but not great value for money.
We had issues with hot water which were not resolved. The house is tired and has a damp smell throughout. I offered the host some constructive advice but she was offended and replied with a sarcastic comment."
386860,518293860,8/26/2019,Great place Just 15min. Out of the city center its clean great beds and shower
386860,519260158,8/28/2019,"What a cool place!  It was such a pleasure to come home to Portobello after a busy day in Dublin. The area is quiet and quaint and still close enough in to the city to reach everything easily.   The decor is happy and interesting and the bright, airy, private space is everything we could have asked for!  The separate washer and dryer were a definite plus!!  Our taxi driver was very happy with our choice not to stay in the touristyù heart of the city and he quite approved of the location as well :)"
386860,521076040,8/31/2019,"Great communication from host prior to our visit. The house is cute and spacious in a lovely location by the canal .. and its dog friendly! We could walk to the city or Rathmines in the opposite direction for restaurants, bars and shopping. Some standards had slipped in certain areas of the property compared to the photos and would benefit from a tidy up and a bit of TLC, ie garden areas, cobwebs and a bit of damp. Really wouldnt take much and Sineads Place would be idyllic."
386860,522621536,9/2/2019,"Sinead has a lovely home. It was the perfect place for my mom, sister and I to stay on the final days of our trip through Ireland. I think it would also be a great place for friends to stay as well. The house was super comfortable and clean. Portobello is a great area of Dublin thats easily walkable to center city (20-25min) and its also close to good food and bars (like the Eatyard and Richmond). Sinead was very helpful and responsive as well. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
386860,524142310,9/5/2019,"Sineads place is in a great location to explore central Dublin and Portobello. Everything on the doorstep. We walked everywhere and lots if things to see on the way. 
Sineads communication  was excellent and the house is really cute and quirky and has a homely feel away from the buzz of city living."
386860,526691517,9/9/2019,Great house in a nice area of Dublin - walking distance to town and to good pubs and restaurants. Sinead was very helpful - perfect spot to spend a long weekend.
386860,528637620,9/13/2019,"Sinead is very responsive, and really nice, and its  a very cute flat! 

Retro vibe, but mod-cons so it is very nice. Very clean on arrival, very nice and checking in and out eezzy-peezzy! We had some hot water issues, wasnt a big issue for us, but could be I guess.

Really cute and easy bus ride to downtown. Lots of shopping and restaurants to stop by. Also, lots of local venues close by.

Overall, very nice!"
386860,535891614,9/25/2019,Great and spacious home right by the canal. It's close to all the actions happening in downtown but a nice quiet place to rest at night. We highly recommend this place!
386860,537325765,9/28/2019,"Nice location, quick response from host, nice shower, full kitchen, just what we needed."
386860,538946060,9/30/2019,"This inspired cottage has charming traditional features and artistic flare. The cottage was perfect for us, a couple, because it was large, easy to enjoy, adjacent to the canal with swans floating by and a fun 20 minute walk to the heart of the City. Our highlights were super comfortable queen bed, easy undesignated free street parking, large shower, canal walking path, and a 2 minute walk to a local Italian restaurant for dinner. The cottage is old fashioned but VERY comfortable. We enjoyed homemade breakfast in the well-equipped kitchen. We appreciate the hosts extras such as extra towels, wash cloths!, myriad shower products and travel book collection. Its easy to recommend this place for a visit to Dublin."
386860,544171120,10/9/2019,Great space that has been given  the right touch. Nice wee home 
386860,548265302,10/17/2019,"This was our first time in Ireland and my friend and I wanted something cozy and close enough to the city to walk. This little gem did not disappoint! There are little pubs and restaurants everywhere within a 10 minute walk. We arrived early and Sinead let us check in with no problems. From the moment we got there it literally felt like home. When my hair straightener broke, Sinead had her husband drop one off for me! The place does have a musky odour but we're Canadian and it just smelled like a typical cottage to us. The canal is right outside the door and you can walk along it and feed the swans. The neighbourhood was quiet but you could get to Grafton St., Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green and Sr. Patrick's Cathedral in about 20 minutes by foot. All in all we lacked for NOTHING. We will 100% be back next year!"
386860,552794103,10/22/2019,"Sinead's place is wonderful. Wonderful, stylish apartment in a fantastic location. Easily walkable to lots of great restaurants and sights. Would definitely stay here again!"

419987,419042851,3/3/2019,"Great place to stay, good location and price.  Liam and Fiona were great with communication and tips for what to do and where to go! Place is within walking distance of shops and supermarkets and not a bad walk to the town.  Apartment is equipped with everything you would need and sleeps 6 comfortably (in 3 doubles).  Would recommend staying here."
419987,421951789,3/10/2019,Rundum gelungen.
419987,425526225,3/18/2019,"Very nice victorian appartment in good Location.
The Communication with the hosts was really great.
The driver took us directly from the Airport to the appartment and back.
Well be back."
419987,427963651,3/24/2019,Pied a terre impeccable !!
419987,437167741,4/14/2019,The host canceled this reservation 81 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
419987,437089563,4/14/2019,"Wonderful place to stay, a bit tucked out of the way from the sights in Dublin, this made it quiet and comfortable. Fiona is wonderful and very helpful!!"
419987,442751382,4/24/2019,"The city is beautiful and so is the Appartment. The interior were nice and the books on Ireland were very helpful. Also the amenities provided were useful. 
The location is nice and the neighbourhood is also warm."
419987,444617474,4/28/2019,We were 5 guests and the place was very comfortable. Liam and Fiona both offered us very good attention and the communication was fine. They also arranged a shuttle from the airport that was good too. Thank you for hosting us. I would definitely recommend this place to stay in Dublin.
419987,447364898,5/3/2019,Very clean comfortable beds and easy transportation via buses.
419987,449185404,5/6/2019,"Convenient place to stay when visiting Dublin, great access to shops near by."
419987,452461941,5/13/2019,We enjoyed our stay here. Fiona was very quick to respond. Our only complaint is that the living room area was a bit chilly.
419987,476058842,6/25/2019,This is a amazing place to stay very clean and well taken care of. Fiona was great to deal with very genuine and available to help at anytime.  Would certainly  go back again. Would  recommend this place to stay.
419987,478975820,6/30/2019,"Liam and Fiona's apartment was perfect for our family of four as we explored Dublin and the surrounding areas.  The apartment itself was quite charming, comfortable and very clean and had everything we needed to get going for the day. We also appreciated the local tips, they were quite helpful.  L Mulligan Grocer for dinner and the Cobblestone for drinks & music were perfect. It was also great having Hanlon's Corner a block away for breakfast as well as food and drinks after long days when we wanted to be close to the apartment - the food was quite good. The amazing Phoenix Park with the Dublin Zoo, which was great, are just a 10-15 minute walk away and well worth visiting.  Getting to the city center was a piece of cake as the bus stop is within sight of the apartment and the ride is very quick.  Getting to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells was maybe a 15-20 minute ride.  Once downtown, the city is very walkable with lots to offer.  While downtown check out Klaw (2 locations in Temple Bar) for great food! From Dublin we were also able to visit Malahide Castle and the incredible playground nearby as well as the fishing village of Howth one day, the stunning Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains National Park (""the garden of Ireland"") another, and Newgrange (get there early!), all reasonable car rides away and well worth day trips. All told we loved our time in Dublin and thank Liam and Fiona for hosting us in their lovely apartment!"
419987,485255697,7/10/2019,"Lovely restored Victorian apartment not too far from the city Centre. If you enjoy walking its no problem, we did all our exploration on foot. Close to buses otherwise. The apartment was very clean, and the extra tall ceilings made it even more spacious. Bagels and fruit were left for us, and Fiona was always a quick text away. Also, two grocery stores within a five minute walk making buying those breakfast needs extra easy. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who doesnt want to be in the middle of the bar scene and likes to urban hikeù around cities ‚ù§Ô∏è"
419987,502032430,8/4/2019,"Great place, great location!

419987,544911984,10/11/2019,"My family of five ( kids 2,6,8) had a wonderful time. We loved that it was such a quick walk to phoenix park, which they really enjoyed playing at even though we did not get to see any deer. It was easy to catch the hop on/off tour from the park which the family loved. So convenient to have washer and dryer available and Fiona was super helpful with getting it started. Our room was super cozy, quiet and dark which was great for helping the kids sleep in after long days. Perfect for fixing up breakfast and found several restaurants in neighborhood to bring food back and enjoy with kids in peace and quiet after long day. Grocery store super convenient to get to as well."

420297,454013163,5/17/2019,Teresa and her husband are excellent hosts! Their place is immaculate and provided everything we needed during our stay.

420297,466570445,6/9/2019,Best wishes
420297,471234169,6/17/2019,"Teresa and her partner are the most wonderful hosts you could wish for! They know the area like no other,  have a lovely place that is clean and has all the amenities you might need, and they provide a very nice breakfast! Since the house is located a little outside the city centre, it is nice and calm and you get to wake up to birdsong, while the city is but a short tramride away. All in all, I would recommend, and I hope to be back one day!"
420297,481274550,7/4/2019,"This is a great little cottage in a lovely part of Dublin. The neighbourhood is safe and vibrant with some great pubs and restaurants, highly recommended."

420297,494427882,7/24/2019,"Lovely place to stay. The hosts are amazing! We got great tips where to visit in Dublin and it really helped us to decided what to see. Place was clean and cozy.
Getting to the centre of Dublin was easy from here. Great stay!"
420297,498051675,7/29/2019,Teresas place was perfect for our short stay!
420297,504150588,8/7/2019,"Teresas place is great! Super friendly, helpful local tips and recommendations, and cute cottage. The location was great for both Dublin and getting a bit into the country."
420297,508031244,8/12/2019,"We stayed for 5 nights Teresa and her husband were very helpful they made us feel at home, great with maps, tips on where to go and Tea."
420297,514041414,8/20/2019,Teresa and Hugh are exceptional hosts. Their home is very clean and comfortable. Breakfast is a huge plus when staying with them. The bus and tram are both very close and bring you directly to the city centre. I highly recommend staying here for all those visiting Dublin!
420297,518324885,8/26/2019,Een heerlijke plek om te verblijven als je in de omgeving van Dublin bent. Goed voorzieningen en nog betere verhuurders. Teresa doet er werkelijk alles aan om het je naar de zin te maken!
420297,525167895,9/7/2019,"Teresa's house is lovely and comfortable, welcoming and sweet.  It's in a quiet suburb of Dublin, tho there's still a great pub on the corner and direct access into town on the #14 bus.  Her beds must be the most comfortable in Dublin.  It was a pleasure to stay here.

We had to figure out the bus to Kilkenny on our last day, and she spent a lot of time with us to figure it out.  

We highly recommend her hospitality."
420297,531417183,9/17/2019,Nice hosts with an easy access to the City center. Even able to catch a day trip and get into the city for 6:30 am 
420297,535852530,9/25/2019,Teresa is great at communicating and very friendly and welcoming. We felt right at home in her space and enjoyed the interactions we had with her and her husband.
420297,539366550,10/1/2019,"Teresas place was lovely and exceeded our expectations.  We got a quiet, comforatable room close to amenities, and just 40 minutes from town. The hosts warm personality was an added bonus."
420297,542355103,10/6/2019,"My friend and I enjoyed our 5 night stay at Theresas Airbnb. We liked our room with 2 single beds, nice shared washroom, everything very clean. Good choices were provided for a help yourself breakfast. The tram is only a 10 minute walk away, gets you in to Dublin within 15 minutes. Theresas husband kindly picked us up at the bus as it was rainy heavily and he provided us with a map and went through how to get to nearby locations. It was a great stay overall and I would highly recommend to stay here."
420297,547863714,10/16/2019,"Things you must do in Dublin: go to a pub, try fish and chips, and stay with Teresa in Churchtown!! Her home is absolutely beautiful, when we arrived she and her husband gave us a ton of recommendations that helped us plan our trip! The house is very close to the tram station and the bus station, so it was very easy to get to the city as well as the airport. Teresa is a lovely host and will always get back to you as soon as possible if you have any questions."
420297,553168340,10/23/2019,Teresa is such a warm soul and that makes her an amazing host. Her home is lovely. Everything was clean. Food was fresh. I would highly recommend to stay here.
420297,560600851,11/7/2019,"Teresa is very friendly. Her home is well located, and she provides great information and recommendations about what to do and see, along with maps. If you need anything, just ask. We had a great stay, and would recommend her highly."
420297,561963374,11/10/2019,"Excellent hosts and in a very good spot for access into dundrum and the city centre 
I have stayed with Teresa before and would highly recommend her 
Great value for money"
420297,565979198,11/18/2019,A good place to spend some time in Dublin. Teresa is very helpful and kind.
421239,431549701,4/1/2019,"Sparkling clean, quiet, convenient to downtown Dublin.  We enjoyed our comfortable, attic room with private bath.  Noeleen is a great host, helpful, and nice.  The light breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurt, toast, coffee and tea was just right."
421239,444617519,4/28/2019,I wouldnt necessarily recommend this place as I did not feel especially welcome.
421239,448608896,5/5/2019,"Noeleen is a great host. She makes you feel at home right away. Very nice, always willing to help. We had a great time at her place. The breakfast was very nice. I would strongly recommend staying at Noeleen's. Muchas gracias."
421239,453968452,5/17/2019,"This is a very nice place to stay at while you're in Dublin. Noeleen is a perfect host, kind and interested and she gave many tips on what to do. It's clean, comfortable and it's great that breakfast is included.
It takes about 30 minutes to walk downtown, but with a Visitors Leap card you can travel unlimited for 24  or 72 hours, or a week. You can reach Noeleens house by many different bus lines."
421239,458554812,5/26/2019,Noeleen was an amazing host! She was there to help with any questions we had for getting around the city or things to do while there. Very clean and a good location!
421239,463361483,6/3/2019,"Een fijne rustige plek, goed te bereiken met openbaar vervoer. In ongeveer 15 min ben je met de bus midden in het centrum. Het isschoon en er is een vriendelijke gastvrouw met een prima ontbijt ."
421239,466492507,6/9/2019,"Noeleen was a wonderful host. Her home was quaint, clean and bright. The attic room where we stayed was private enough for the two of us. Location was also nice being about a 20 minute walk to the city center, or a $10 taxi ride."
421239,471406566,6/17/2019,A little too small for 2 people over 6 feet tall
421239,479682580,7/1/2019,Loved our stay in the attic room. Great location in Glasnevin and Noeleen was excellent hostess. Bus stop right there. Good variety of food and pubs short walk away. Close to botanical gardens and Glasnevin cemetery.
421239,498147876,7/29/2019,We had a lovely stay and were very comfortable. Its a quiet spot with nice local walks to enjoy as well as not too far from centre of city by bus.
421239,526731138,9/9/2019,Noeleen & her home are awesome! She has a fantastic knowledge of whats going on in and around Dublin or of things to see and do. Noeleen is a fantastic host!!! Couldnt be any better Ive stayed with Noeleen twice now and would not hesitate to stay again. Thanks Noeleen
421239,528638480,9/13/2019,"Snelle respons per mail, uitgebreide info over hoe de woning te bereiken. Vriendelijke ontvangst. Daarna vonden wij de host eerder afstandelijk. We hadden gehoopt op wat inside informatie, andere dan in de boekjes over Dublin . Het ontbijt was niet wat we verwachtten : enkel ontbijtgranen en beperkt aantal sneetjes droog brood.  Bij ons volgend bezoek aan Dublin zoeken we geen airbnb meer met ontbijt gezien je overal , in iedere levensmiddelen winkel kan ontbijten"
421239,531415711,9/17/2019,"We visited Dublin for my birthday weekend, we booked the accommodation last minute and Noeleen was very responsive and helpful during the whole process - before & during the stay! Personal touches like a homemade muffin with a candle on arrival (my actual birthday) was a wonderful surprise. Highly recommend as great location, near the High Street (bus stop nearby the property), overall stay - great! Thank you, Anna & Dan"
421239,532648750,9/20/2019,"Noeleen's place is just as described - a private attic room with a view, along with a private full bathroom just for your use. Noeleen is a lovely, kind host and we completely enjoyed our stay in her home. Breakfast is light and healthy and self-serve,  exactly the way I prefer it. We walked everywhere and didn't take the bus or tram at all, although it's very convenient and stops right outside the house (note that we are dyed in the wool walkers who prefer to soak up the city through the soles of our feet). Noeleen's recommendations were all excellent - don't miss the Kilmainham Gaol tour! It was fascinating. We would return to Noeleen's in a heartbeat. Thank you!"
421239,541508056,10/5/2019,"Wonderfull time with Noellen. Great place: warm, quiet and clean, and a lovely person."
421239,546948771,10/14/2019,"Noeleen was a great host, providing a map and helpful recommendations.  The space itself is very pretty and comfortable.  The neighborhood is a short and convenient bus ride from the city center.  I would have loved to explore more of Glasnevin itself if there had been more time, as the National Botanic Gardens and the cemetery where many revolutionaries are buried are right there."
421239,554363855,10/26/2019,"We were so glad we booked with Noeleen. Communication was fast and really informative and Noeleen offered a warm welcome. The room was a really good size for two people with the bathroom just down the steps (bath always a plus, decent shower). Breakfast in the beautiful dining room was a real bonus and the selection of toast, cereal and fruit set us up for the day and saved us some euros! The location is a little way out of the city but there are loads of buses and we got a 3 day LEAP card so it wasn't a problem at all. Would be happy to stay with Noeleen again!"
421239,559520024,11/4/2019,"Noeleen is a welcoming host and she will give you great recommendations for restaurants, shops or museums. 
Also the Glasnevin cemetery and botanic gardens are right next door, and it's really worth visiting."
424596,421904870,3/10/2019,Perfect location. Cool building
424596,422849157,3/12/2019,jederzeit wieder
424596,423820692,3/15/2019,"What a gem!  Most visitors to Dublin don't even get a glimpse beyond the front door of the Georgian townhomes - let alone stay in one.  Our flat was every bit as lovely as the pictures - and so very comfortable.  Karin provided thoughtful touches and useful information.  We really enjoyed the neighbourhood, with a convenience shop, cafe and coffee shop all within a block.  And the location gave us an enjoyable 20 minute walk right into the city centre.  Our stay here really made our trip to Dublin extra special."
424596,426499023,3/21/2019,"Wonderful stay with Karin in a fantastic space. Lots of great, thoughtful touches. Milk in the fringe, shampoo AND conditioner in the shower, extra pillows on the bed. Karin is a natural host and the space is really impressive - how many opportunities do you have to sleep in an historic building in a round room?! Loved it"
424596,427801377,3/24/2019,Great location for a quick walk to most everything. We loved exploring Dublin and never found ourselves too far from our home to walk back. The space is cute and in a beautiful building. Karin was very attentive! Thank you!
424596,430357421,3/30/2019,"Karin was great to stay with. Room was beautiful with such great touches, not just your average room. She took the time to highlight a map showing us all of the must-see places in the city, which helped tailor our trip to make sure we hit as much as possible in a shorter stay. Thanks again!"
424596,431581042,4/1/2019,"What a beautiful Apartment, if you want a nostalgic and cultural place to stay this meets the bill.  A beautiful apartment with good amenities in a Georgian Town House.  Couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay and explore Dublin from.  Walked everywhere and covered a lot in our short time."
424596,434043471,4/7/2019,"We had a wonderful stay in Karin's Place and in Dublin from wednesday evening until sunday morning. 
We can reccommend it to anyone, except if you are taller than 1,90m  - then the rain shower will not be high enough for you."
424596,438333900,4/16/2019,"If you want to visit Dublin, look no further , this is the total package!"
424596,440943630,4/21/2019,"Wonderful location on Mountjoy Square.  Karin was a fantastic host - friendly, helpful, and available anytime.  She shared great advice regarding rental cars (your really dont need one), taxis and local attractions.   The space was very comfortable for our family. Beautiful space with very high ceilings!  Neat, authentic neighborhood feel, very walkable and near just about everything (we walked the 15-20 minutes to Temple Bar and surrounding areas). Great Asian food around the corner on Parnell Street (Pho Viet was excellent).  Absolutely perfect!"
424596,442443444,4/23/2019,This place is great. Easy to find. Easy to get to all the attractions and the apartment itself was wonderful. The host is great and has many great tips on what to do in Dublin. I would def come back
424596,445452381,4/29/2019,"Karins place is even nicer than it appears in photos (which show it quite well). It was a wonderfully restored space that felt historic while having modern amenities -  a perfect respite from the vibrancy of Dublin.  The Georgian townhouse is beautifully restored, as well.  I enjoyed the diversity in the neighborhood, too, with a variety of shops nearby, and Mountjoy Square is a pleasant green space as well.

I found it an excellent location to explore the sights of central Dublin and would love to return at some point."
424596,447899593,5/4/2019,"Karin does a great job making you feel welcome.  She goes out of her way to provide nice things for you. Her directions are excellent. It was a joy staying there.  You can tell she wants to do an excellent job, and make everything lovely for her guests."
424596,450412162,5/9/2019,"A beautiful space in a great location with a great host. What more do you need?  Very close to everything to do in Dublin. A few blocks from bus service to and from the Airport. A few blocks from the tram going into the heart of the city. A few blocks from the Asian restaurant quarter where you can get great Sichuan food and a whole lot more. 
Our host brought us down some baked milk custard desert she made and it was wonderful. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
424596,451144175,5/11/2019,"Karin's place is in a great location and is a stylish loft. Check in was super easy, and the place was as expected in pictures shown. Lots of helpful tips and recommendations were given and communication was timely. The only issue we had was that our lock broke, but after a short time we sorted this out with Karin and were able to regain entry to our apartment. Would stay here again and recommend for sure! Thanks again for a great stay Karin!"
424596,452872287,5/14/2019,Karins apartment was beautiful and clean. She accommodated our request to drop our luggage early. We met Jackie and she had some excellent tips and recommendations for breakfast at King Fisher about a ten minute walk from the apartment. The apartment was exactly as pictured. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. Close enough to the touristy core of Dublin but far enough to not be noisy at night.
424596,454029921,5/17/2019,"A beautifully appointed apartment just a short walk away from all the action on OConnell and beyond.  Comfortable bed, great rainhead shower, fresh flowers, an extensive list of recommendations, well-stocked kitchen and breakfast items provided made for wonderful stay.  Visit the Kingfisher restaurant on Parnell for a brilliant breakfast and the best scones in Dublin.  My only suggestion is that if you are a light sleeper or prone to disturbed sleep, consider using ear plugs for the morning traffic noise.  We highly recommend Karins property!"
424596,458571885,5/26/2019,Nice apartment very close to Croke Park. Ideal for a concert
424596,460790350,5/30/2019,"The room was very nice and within walking distance of everything in central Dublin. Unfortunately, my host did not inform me that the front door of the building was going to be replaced during my stay. I came back from a day trip at 9pm on Tuesday to find the front door boarded up with no keyhole or door knob. I had received no messages about this. I am very lucky that another guest was in the building who heard me banging on the boarded-up door and shouting my hosts name, who came down to show me around through the back. I was not made aware that there was a back entry where I could use my key. The back entry was through a small door, about 4ft tall, behind the garbage bins. The room itself, however, was very pleasant, in spite of that experience."
424596,462830174,6/2/2019,Very pleasant stay! Beautiful studio apartment in a great location and a super helpful host.
424596,463856923,6/4/2019,"Great location within walking distance of the city center. We walked every day we were there, it takes about 5 mins to get to O'Connell St and 10-15 to get across the bridge into Temple Bar and Trinity College Area. Apartment was nice, quiet, and cleanly. Nice architecture and easy to find transportation to and from the airport. We took a taxi from the airport, and public bus back to the airport to pick up our rental car. Karin was very thorough with information and prompt responding to any questions! Definitely recommend the place!"
424596,465229908,6/7/2019,The apartment was so beautiful and charming with 5 star touches. A great place out of the noice and making you feel like a local. Wonderful place I would recommend to anyone looking to have a memorable visit it Dublin.
424596,472812767,6/20/2019,"Karins place is lovely and the loft bedroom is charming. Karin was communicative throughout the entire process, and everything was very well organized. Its a great location and easy to explore Dublins sights-highly recommend!"
424596,482347576,7/6/2019,A lovely flat experience in a great location!
424596,487591011,7/14/2019,Karins apartment is a chance to stay in a historic space in Dublin. The kitchen has been modernized and has all the amenities you will need. It is walkable from Connolly station where there are several large grocery stores and only a few minutes from the Parnell LUAS stop.
424596,489157965,7/16/2019,"Karin's place was wonderful.  A picture says a thousand word, but the pictures do her beautiful place no justice.  The flat was homey, but so very elegant.  Her attention to the smallest details was astounding.  She even had a universal charge converter available and waiting on the mantle.  Everything was there for our first breakfast, which negated the shopping.  She even did a last minute load of laundry, so we could continue on our journey with clean clothes.  The home was centrally located, close to everything and the neighborhood felt quite safe.  My only regret was that our stay in Dublin was so short that we didn't get to spend enough time enjoying this lovely home away from home.  Yet, it just gives us another excuse to come back to Dublin!"
424596,493832312,7/23/2019,"Location is perfect, you can walk almost anywhere from there.  You have a complete access to the place so you can come and go as you please."
424596,499361827,7/31/2019,"Charming studio with everything you need for a great stay in Dublin. Well-appointed kitchen, great light, comfortable spaces. Convenient location (10-minute walk to the Liffey River; 20 to the convention centre; and away from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar). Karin's hospitality really makes this place special. The fresh flowers in the entryway, personal check-ins, and tasty baked goods are a real treat!"
424596,503008437,8/5/2019,"Wonderful, beautiful and large apartment with thoughtful touches and amenities. The hosts are super responsive and friendly. Highly recommend."
424596,508041524,8/12/2019,You wont find better than Karins. Fabulous unique studio with a loft and a GREAT host
424596,516433210,8/24/2019,"Karin's home is beautiful. The flat I stayed in was exactly as the pictures conveyed and was a beautiful spot to call home for my few days in Dublin. Karin was very attentive when I had an issue, and was very pleasant to speak with. The flat is in the heart of the city, which comes with the accessibility of all public transport and most things in walking distance. I really enjoyed my stay."
424596,527582092,9/11/2019,"This place was super cute. I liked the layout, it was nice to be able to cook meals here, and we were walking distance from all of the places we wanted to go!"
424596,528447796,9/13/2019,A super little flat in a great location. Karin goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and it really feels like home. Well worth a visit.
424596,530005697,9/15/2019,"A lovely, conveniently located place that had all the amenities you could ask for. We were able to walk to a majority of then local spots in Dublin. Overall, would recommend!"
424596,531817295,9/18/2019,Beautiful building and stair case. Great location. Fully equipped. Very roomy space. Relatively quiet given the proximity to a major street. Very close to the Hop on Hop off bus service. Also a reasonable walk to down town.
424596,535802788,9/25/2019,Good location to city center. Walkable area. Highly recommend The Celt pub on Talbot.
424596,538868216,9/30/2019,"We would highly recommend this lodging. Beautifully decorated, comfortable, well equipped, great location, thorough guides to the apartment and visiting Dublin. Karin is indeed a super host."
424596,539951097,10/2/2019,"Karins BnB is very nice. The apartment is  lovely, and located within walking distance to the main Dublin area, and transportation. 
We really appreciated the  tips she gave us about getting around, and all the amenities close by."
424596,541561480,10/5/2019,"This place was wonderful and so was Karin. The place was spotlessly clean, Karin gave loads of really helpful information about how to get to the apartment, how to get around the neighborhood, and advice on how to get around Dublin (all of which made everything so easy for us as first-time visitors to the city), and I honestly have nothing at all to complain about. Ive never had an Airbnb host who was as detailed and informative before. We spent three very enjoyable days in Dublin and it was great having this place to go back to after a long day of sightseeing."
424596,543785092,10/8/2019,Make sure you a bottom-floor flat if you want a night's sleep.
424596,544853499,10/11/2019,Beautiful house in a convenient location. Everything is in great condition. Would definitely recommend to that who visit Dublin.
424596,546237294,10/13/2019,Karins home cant be beat. She also went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant stay. It exceeded our needs and I hope to stay here again someday.
424596,548359515,10/17/2019,Karin is an excellent host. Some lovely amenities and special touches.  Great local tips.
424596,550771996,10/19/2019,This apartment is beautiful and you'll love the Georgian period styling and decor.  It's located near the center of Dublin making most of it walkable --  really a treat to stay there.
424596,552337352,10/21/2019,"Lovely apartment, really quite lush. The bed was very comfy, kitchen had everything you needed - even had milk, eggs, coffee, tea, nice and yoghurt. I could have moved in! Very close to centre of Dublin, not far to walk at all."
424596,553838645,10/25/2019,"Cosy warm, unique, well equipped apartment with lots of info about places to visit and eat etc., great books and dvds... we could have happily just stayed in!!
Karin and Jackie were easy to communicate with and quick to respond, there were eggs, milk, jams, smoothies... a really good selection of basics and beyond which was perfect as we were exhausted when we arrived and didn't need to go straight out shopping! We were able to leave our bags on our last day and borrow an umbrella... 
Would love to visit Dublin again and would definitely stay in the Oval Room again :)"
424596,555883704,10/28/2019,"I started off my AirBnB experience with Karin in 2013, and was delighted to return to a different flat in her beautiful Georgian townhouse for this stay with husband in tow. It was just as lovely as I'd remembered it. The furnishings are beautiful, the kitchen really well equpped, and place stylish and comfy. There's everything here for a lovely stay., one you won't forget. There are some good restaurants close by, or supermarkets if you fancy staying in. Everything's really well thought through. The whole place is gorgeous. You can't go wrong, and I'd never stay elsewhere in Dublin."
424596,556798629,10/30/2019,"Perfect cozy getaway. Very clean, and comfortable. With all the touches to make you feel you are the heart of Dublin."
424596,558003308,11/2/2019,Charming historical loft which is great for a stay in Dublin. The building is beautiful and had lovely details including the lilies. Karin also responded promptly to messages. The only downside is many locals said the neighborhood is not the safest so we ended up taking cabs home each night.
424596,559615189,11/4/2019,Great host and awesome space! Karin and Jackie were great hosts and the place was unique and very clean! I recommend staying here for sure!
424596,562090123,11/10/2019,"Karin's Georgian studio was adorable! Tucked away in Dublin 1, it was away from the revelers downtown, yet very easy to get to by Tram and a short 7 min walk. The building itself was across the street from a sweet park. Inside, I loved all the original architectural details of the apartment, especially the large front window with folding wood shutters. Karin provided some breakfast items, which was very helpful as I arrived quite late in the evening. She also had a large map and other information waiting for me so that I could plan my walks and errands. Overall, I recommend Karin's studio without hesitation."
425164,424257328,3/16/2019,"Our stay with Hans and Deirdre far exceeded our expectations. They greeted us warmly and their home quickly felt like our own.

As three young women, we felt safe and comfortable in their home as well as in Dublin. Thank you, Hans and Deirdre!!"
425164,454971590,5/19/2019,"Our stay with Hans and Deirdre was the best of all our Airbnb experiences.  Hans met us at the door and after getting us settled in pointed out all the attractions on the city map.  He even drove me to one attraction and got me admitted even though it had been sold out online.  Breakfast was excellent, including Deirdre's homemade scones; and they sat down to eat with us  where we had wide-ranging conversations as well as suggestions on restaurants and bars.
We had the whole second floor of the house, a sitting room, bedroom, and bath, all very large, comfortable and private.  We are so thankful for such a wonderful visit and would love to stay with Hans and Deirdre again if we returned to Dublin."

425164,492288449,7/21/2019,"This really is great location to explore Dublin. Central enough for all amenities, although never noisy, and relaxing in the evenings, also note the extremely comfy beds with quality cool cotton bedding...slept like a log!

Hans and Deirdre have wonderful hosting skills, they are two of the loveliest people you could ever wish to meet, we started every morning greeted with  genuine smiles, great conversation, and a  lovely fresh breakfast, .
Hans has a great knowledge of the local area and the history, which he shared with us, this was invaluable and really interesting.

Thank you so much Hans and Deirdre for making our visit to Dublin so amazing!
Hope to see you both again next time we are in Dublin.


Julia and Sam.

Its easy to get downtown and to the airport within 20 minutes.
426326,527637441,9/11/2019,"Margaret's place is just as advertised. The room was clean and comfortable.  If was the first time we'd booked a room rather than an entire private space, so it was a bit of a new experience, especially with the shared bathroom facilities.  Margaret and Gordon were very friendly and helpful.  We basically used the place as a crash pad for sleeping as we were very busy on this trip. 
The location was good for getting my daughter settled in at DCU.  The only additional thing I'd mention is that if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, you probably would be affected here."

Convenient location for sightseeing in Dublin and the surrounding area.  Gave us a great tip on visiting Howth, a local active fishing village close to their location.  Also gave us hints about shopping, restaurants and evening entertainment close to them.  We recommend their location if you are visiting Dublin.
Shirley and Robert."
426326,544565968,10/10/2019,"Margaret and Gordon are great hosts, very welcoming and personable. The location of their home is a quick walk to the bus 16 that runs to the south side of the Liffey, Trinity College area so very easy to get downtown. This same bus line runs to the airport as well, so an ideal location to save some money with public transit and an affordable place to stay as Dublin can be quite expensive. Would stay again!"

We stayed 4 nights and were comfortable there. 
You get exactly what you pay for, which echoes exactly what we saw from reviews we saw before booking. 
The one issue we had was that the communal areas of the house smelt of stale smoke, but it didn't effect the room, which smelt fine. 
Everything was clean, tidy and spacious."
426326,558670465,11/3/2019,Sehr nette Leute!!!
426326,560903436,11/8/2019,It's a nice place but the house rules are very tight and breakfast is just cereal or toast...
426326,562072411,11/10/2019,"We had two nights at Margarets house. Everything was fine. We had a nice chat with her and her husband as well. The walk to the bus station is about 6 min. from there you can get to the airport and the city center in about 30 min.

Highly recommend!"
427077,429928807,3/29/2019,Place was cute and cozy. Just be careful if you are tall as the ceiling in the bed upstairs loft is low. Im 5/7 and could stand upright while tapping the ceiling.
427077,437020095,4/14/2019,"The flat is in a good location, an easy 20 minute walk from the centre. We really liked the fire and the breakfast items that were left. However I felt it was a bit overpriced for what's quite a small space and the communication was a bit slow. There's also lots of signs and messages telling you what not to do in the flat, which does make it harder to feel at home."
427077,440129556,4/20/2019,Couldnt recommend this property highly enough. It delivers on every level.
427077,449722659,5/7/2019,"Karin is a wonderful host and makes sure you know what is available and expected.  Her place was clean and within walking distance of everywhere, we wanted to go."

427077,460107155,5/28/2019,great hostes
427077,460925206,5/30/2019,"I was charmed by Karin's lovely Georgian flat when I saw the photos online and the real thing certainly exceeded my expectations! She is the consummate host who has thought of everything. A stocked kitchen, a bathroom loaded with toiletries, wonderful books and DVDs, a working fireplace (we didn't use it), heaps of guide books and maps in addition to her own excellent suggestions... I could go on and on.  The street was perfectly quiet during the night and a quick 15 minute walk to the River Liffey. Karin herself greeted us warmly. I can't imagine a better Air BNB experience and I can't wait to go to Dublin and stay with Karin again!"

427077,475953658,6/25/2019,Karins place was an overall good stay for us. She was thoughtful and left some foods for us in the fridge and was quick to respond to anything we needed. The location was a 15 minute walk to downtown and was pretty safe. My only complaint was the shower was very small but other than that it was a great stay!
427077,477515644,6/28/2019,Truly marvelous experience all 'round.
427077,478975844,6/30/2019,"I did book this app for family members as a birthday gift, they loved it."
427077,480756222,7/3/2019,"We enjoyed our stay in Dublin and Karin's apartment is in a unique area of Georgian homes.  We thought it was great to see this bit of architectural history up close.

427077,504897466,8/8/2019,"Karin is the best. She gave us tips about what to see while we were here. She was very accommodating and helpful. Couldnt have done any better. Its a gorgeous old building As well. We would definitely return and hope to someday. Thanks, Karin!"
427077,508819624,8/13/2019,"Karins place was nice and clean. You do have to walk through a bit of a rough area when waking to any of the tourist sites and I would not recommend walking at night, take a cab. There is a lovely little pub and grocery right down the street. There is a china townù two blocks away and an absolutely amazing Turkish kebab one block away. Nice visit overall."
427077,509827686,8/15/2019,"This is an beautiful, well-furnished space. Karin was easy to communicate with, check-in was seamless, and there was a comprehensive local guide left in the apartment.

The only thing to be aware of is the low ceiling over the sleeping loftîeasy enough to deal with once youve encountered it. Wed happily stay here again."
427077,513226442,8/19/2019,This is a charming apartment with a loft in a quiet building. II is in a great location. Karin was very helpful and responsive prior to our arrival and everything about our stay Was perfect!
427077,514414197,8/21/2019,"Wow! This was the most beautiful and welcoming AirBnB we have stayed at!  It is first of all a very charming space, an oval apartment tastefully decorated. And a working fireplace in front of a deliciously comfortable sofa was the perfect place to while away a cool summer night. Karin has all top end appliances and she keeps her units in immaculate condition. She stocks the refrigerator with items for breakfast which was a very homey touch.  Bed and pillows provided a wonderful nights rest. We enjoyed our conversations with Karin, as well. This is an exceptional place to stay."
427077,517222598,8/25/2019,"Absolute gem in Dublin!  Gorgeous Georgian house converted into apartments.  Karin has added some wonderful touches and I just loved staying there.  The apartment had everything I needed and more.  Location is an easy walk to Dublins shopping area and some great places to eat.   I would highly recommend staying here, a great find!"
427077,522476781,9/2/2019,A really interesting room in a good location.  I pretty much walked everywhere from there. Karin is very responsive to questions and provided a great guide for the room and things to see and do.
427077,540860350,10/4/2019,"Beautiful apartment conveniently located to walk to nearly all major Dublin sites.  It is as it appears in the photos.  There is a remarkably efficient use of space with a fully equipped kitchen (a nice touch being some light breakfast in the kitchen on arrival, adequate for one breakfast), small but nice bathroom and loft bed.  Detailed instructions for check in, departure, restaurants etc were provided.  Street noise mentioned in some other reviews was not a problem with windows and shutters closed as instructed.
WiFi and TV reception were spotty."
427077,543182681,10/7/2019,"This accommodation was spacious, attractive, and well located to take advantage of all the attractions of Dublin. Karin provided a great deal of useful information in advance of our arrival. Although we never met, I had the sense that she is very much involved in insuring that the room is well taken care of. We wouldn't hesitate to return."
427077,544499637,10/10/2019,"Great location and hosts provide plenty of amenities such as coffeemaker, cooking supplies, etc. Best of all, they provide a super convenient laundry service for only ten Euros!

Place is a little older than I expected. Bed is a bit barebones and uncomfortable, which is my biggest critique. Towels were very coarse - better to bring your own.

Overall host is very communicative and their instructions are well laid out. Very tourist friendly and many guidebooks and maps provided.

Good privacy too. Its very much a self service experience.

Recommend based on excellent location and laundry service."
427077,548315973,10/17/2019,"An absolutely charming apartment nicely located in a quiet area. There was fresh fruit, smoothie, yogurt, coffee and tea when we arrived. Karin left lots of brochures and thorough instructions for everything you could want to know. Space is small and cozy with a bedroom loft and lovely interior design. There is a nice selection of books by Irish authors on the shelves. We enjoyed just sitting reading on the comfy couch in the evening. We would love to book again in the future."
427077,552296876,10/21/2019,Great little place to stay. Close to the city center (walking distance).
427077,553074329,10/23/2019,"I had a nice time in this unique, classic apartment. Karin left detailed tips and everything I needed was in walking distance."
427077,556790555,10/30/2019,"Not kidding at all when I say this is exactly what I would pick if I could have any apartment :) it's so adorable, with a touch of history, the round room is really unique, and it's very cosy. The location was fantastic, you're a stone's throw from transit and about 20 minutes walking from anything you'll want to see while in town. My only critique is that the shower is very teeny, so be aware if you're a large person! It's nice to have access to a fully stocked kitchen, and Karin and Jackie were very eager to help in any way during my stay. I would absolutely highly recommend!"
427495,419002546,3/3/2019,Margarets place was very convenient and a great value. Perfect for a short stay near Dublin.
427495,426238966,3/20/2019,"Margaret and her husband were very friendly and informative. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. They even prepare breakfast and sit with you, its a very great opportunity to get to know them. The smell when you enter the house is amazing, a lovely touch! And regarding the bathroom the shower was very nice! It was a great first air bnb experience!"
427495,427928128,3/24/2019,Lovely attic room let out by an equally lovely couple. Margaret gave us hints about where to go and how to use the buses etc. Great price for a room so near the bus route to the city.
427495,431030971,3/31/2019,This is a great space for visiting Dublin as its close to both the airport and the city via bus. Theres a nice pub nearby and Margaret was very hospitable

427495,441698381,4/22/2019,"Margaret and her husband were absolutely awesome. They provided us many tips what to see and visit, they were very talkative, helpful and gave us privacy. Margaret also rang taxi for us when we needed it but it's very close to the center and airport by bus, too. We recommend that everyone stay with them if you wish to visit Ireland."
427495,451700088,5/12/2019,We really enjoy the stay and the hostess we're very nice and friendly. The bus was near the house and leaves at the center.

427495,461858871,6/1/2019,I stayed with Margaret for one night before getting a flight from Dublin airport. Location was handy - 10 minute drive. Margaret was there to welcome me and guided me to local spots for food. I had a great sleep in a comfy bed in the attic room - very quiet and comfortable. An enjoyable night and I'll def stay again as the need arises. 
427495,462824910,6/2/2019,Great room in a good location.  Very friendly hosts.
427495,470674778,6/16/2019,Margarets place is great for those visiting Dublin on a budget. It is easily accessible via bus and was a good location to stay for concerts at Malahide castle. Margaret is great at communicate and was very accommodating with an early check in time.
427495,474593513,6/23/2019,"Very nice room and cosy. Easy access to the center 
Margaret was very friendly"
427495,478699363,6/30/2019,Margaret y Gordon son muy amables me ayudaron a llegar bien a su casa me ayudaron con direcciones para llegar a sitios que ellos me recomendaban ... lo recomiendo
427495,492378158,7/21/2019,"Margaret and Gordon are warm gregarious people who keep a tidy place and offer a home away from home, with easy access to transportation to the city. Gordon took our suitcases up to our attic room and I heard and saw him do the same for other guests on the first floor. Breakfast was a surprise as they provided hot tea/coffee and a simple tasty breakfast. They helped other guests check in to their flight, told us how to get around, ordered us a taxi. Wonderful hosts!"
427495,512322818,8/18/2019,"A very confortable house. Margaret and her husband are very welcoming and give you all the information needed to reach the city centre or the airport. My week-end was amazing, thank you !!"
427495,526009214,9/8/2019,Enjoyed my stay. Every thing was clean and comfortable. Quiet and safe area.  I would be happy to to stay here again.   Convenient location.
427495,533943194,9/22/2019,"Margaret is very hospitable and served a great breakfast. Her husband Gordon was very helpful at checkin and guided me to a nice Thai take-away place for dinner. They let me park my rental car in their driveway. The room was very clean as were the bathrooms. It was also quiet and very dark at night which was great. The mattress was a bit old but if you dont mind that, the place is great!"
427495,542136523,10/6/2019,"Very lovely people ready to wait for you in case of late flight.
Place nicely connected with buses to go to the city center
Was just missing places to hang damp clothes in the room"
427495,546000276,10/13/2019,"Margrets place was in a fantastic location from both the airport and the city center. The breakfast was a full meal with juice, coffee, toast and cereal. We were wonderfully welcomed and the couple was extremely friendly and helpful about any questions I had. I definitely recommend staying here !!"
427495,551557728,10/20/2019,"Very nice hosts, 
close to bus which takes you into the centre, light breakfast in the morning - all fine :-)"
427495,555969681,10/28/2019,"Great host, always available to answer any questions, spotless facilities and great location"
427495,558861382,11/3/2019,"Everything was perfect! The location is very good, very hospitable hosts, would highly recommend"
427495,562101145,11/10/2019,Margarets place was lovely and comfortable. I would highly recommend this place
449556,437807109,4/15/2019,"Matts bed and breakfast was just what we expected. If youre looking for a quick, in-n-out spot in advance of an early morning flight, this is your spot. Check-in was very clear and Matt was responsive, there is a great pub two buildings down (Kealys), and the breakfast downstairs was an added bonus before a long day of travel. I stayed in a single room (3 beds), and everything was fairly clean. The bathroom wasnt sparkling clean, but it was fine."
449556,438737720,4/17/2019,Matt's place is very near the airport and so very useful to get to the airport for a morning flight.  We found it to be quite expensive for four of us to stay here but perhaps it is inline with other prices in Dublin.
449556,440041674,4/20/2019,We were disappointed with our stay.   The place isnt inviting to say the least. Its very basic and bare bones. A question of cleanliness.  Not for a family.
449556,445474190,4/29/2019,This place was awesome so close to the airport and great food next door
449556,455030791,5/19/2019,Good place to stay if looking near airport.
449556,456392050,5/21/2019,"We were a bit disappointed with this guest house. The address given for (Hidden by Airbnb) maps was confusing. It kept trying to take us around the back side near an office building and parking lot which was not accessible to the house. It would be helpful to note it is across the street from the rental cars. The beds were okay. The door handle to the guesthouse was almost falling off. The breakfast was disappointing, just a loaf of bread, a bowl of fruit and instant coffee mix. Overall, it met our needs of staying close to the airport but wasnt the warm Irish welcome we hoped for."
449556,458545353,5/26/2019,Good location
449556,460805158,5/30/2019,Very Close to the (Website hidden by Airbnb) convenient.
449556,461245062,5/31/2019,"Basic accommodations, one notch above a hostel and therefore over priced. Compared to the 4 other Airbnb we stayed at in Ireland it  was disappointing."
449556,462696642,6/2/2019,Within walking distance (10 min) from the airport. Quiet place to rest your head during a layover. Would recommend.
449556,465821757,6/8/2019,Very convenient location for the Airport within Walking distance. Room is a bit worn but the price is competely adequate.
449556,469219857,6/14/2019,"(Zero stars not available) Doors to bedrooms share keys, so if you expect a secure stay don't stay here. We were woken up in the middle of the night by someone entering our room with a key!! We were startled awake at 12am and as a result we got NO sleep what so ever because we became fearful for our families safety.  We had an early morning flight so we wanted to get to sleep early.  However they do not turn on the hot water until 7pm and it does not get warm enough to take a shower until 8pm.  We had been traveling all day and got to the Hostel at around 4pm and could not get cleaned up until 8pm.  I call this place a hostel because that is all this is.  For the price you get uncomfortable beds, people screaming outside, no hot water until 8pm, and strangers unlocking your door at 12:30am. 
 We were in Ireland for 2 weeks and stayed at various locations across the country...this was by far the worst accommodation we've stayed in...in Ireland or anywhere else for that matter. The owner never responded to our emails about security issues. Honestly, pass this one up folks!"
449556,470498379,6/16/2019,Great time!
449556,472781326,6/20/2019,"This place is nothing fancy, purely functional. If youre looking to stay close to the airport for a reasonable cost this is it, but its bare-bones in regards to housing. Clean, and easy to get to the airport on a free 10 minute shuttle. Nothing like the family run B&Bs in the rest of Ireland we stayed in, but you get what you pay for."
449556,473911899,6/22/2019,"Basic but spotless, excellent location to the airport and facilities for breakfast if your leaving early in the morning."
449556,474493233,6/23/2019,"Lovely location, but awful host"
449556,487857052,7/14/2019,Fine family room for a quick stop close to the airport but not much else.
449556,498767838,7/30/2019,Good location near airport
449556,505526042,8/9/2019,Good location for dropping rentals off and a short walk to the airport. Definitely recommend if your flying early morning next day.
449556,509383249,8/14/2019,It is a good place when you want to reach the airport in time in the morning. Rhe bedroom was nice and clean. The breakfast was a bit scanty.
449556,510040553,8/15/2019,This location is perfect for any traveler that needs to be at the airport early in the morning. It is literally right across the street from the car rental return yard.
449556,513224748,8/19/2019,Matts place is good if you want to be within walking distance of the airport! But expect a pretty mediocre room and bathroom. Cleanliness was okay. My friends and I were only there for about 8 hrs so it fit our needs and our expectations! But its not ideal for a long or luxurious stay.
449556,516533367,8/24/2019,Sehr sauber und gut gelegen direkt am Airport
449556,517427764,8/25/2019,Ideally located close to the airport and car hire.  The common breakfast area was well supplied and clean.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.
449556,518860580,8/27/2019,Beautiful accommodation :) easy to get there.
449556,519899840,8/29/2019,A fairly barebones bnb but the location is amazing if you want a stop over that is very close to the airport!
451611,420290182,3/6/2019,"Good location near many attractions and restaurants/bars. The hosts worked to get us a free parking spot, which was a huge help as we rented a car. The amenities and fixtures in the unit itself are average."
451611,421012703,3/8/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Daraghs place!  The location is great (pay close attention to his instructions for how to find the entrance), the flat was clean and smelled nice, and Daragh was SUPER fast at responding to any messages/questions/concerns I sent. I definitely recommend this place! We would stay here again if we returned to Dublinîespecially if its during the warmer months so we could enjoy the terrace and wonderful view of the cathedral, park, and Patrick Street."
451611,422010090,3/10/2019,Nice and clean place in a great location. Daragh was very helpful. I recommend this place :)
451611,422857536,3/12/2019,Great location! Close to so much to see and experience. The balcony view is especially appealing.
451611,425926956,3/19/2019,"Lovely host, beautiful apartment! Perfect location."
451611,426923694,3/22/2019,What a lovely spot right by St Patrick's! We spent a number of hours sitting out on the balcony overlooking the church. Very easy to walk to everything we  could ever want. The hosts were friendly and communicative throughout the trip! We would definitely stay again on return to Dublin.
451611,428584067,3/25/2019,"Fantastic location, walking distance to temple bar, Guinness factory, plenty of bars/ restaurants/ cafes & right across from St Patricks cathedral."
451611,429214752,3/27/2019,Daraghs place was very lovely with an extraordinary view of St. Patricks cathedral and the park. A convenient walk from all of the major stops makes for an easy time exploring! Daragh was extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in and drop our luggage early after a long day of travel. Fallons nearby was a great recommended pub and Arthurs had a delicious meal. Would recommend this flat to anybody who will be in Dublin!
451611,431039096,3/31/2019,"Unfortunately, I was not happy with my experience in Daraghs apartment. After reading this review, you may very well decide that the things that disappointed me about the apartment are not the kinds of things that would bother you. But personally, I would not rent this apartment again. And Im sorry and sad to have to state that. With that mentioned, there certainly are a lot of positives about this apartment. The location is pretty wonderful. Its so close to the city center, and there are plenty of great restaurants, and shops, and just about anything you would need or want within just a few blocks. The proximity to St. Patricks Cathedral right across the street, and viewable from the apartment windows and balcony, is super charming and kind of romantic. The cathedrals park and gardens across the street are really beautiful. In good weather (hey, it can and does happen in Dublin!), its a great place to sit and people watch and take a little break from your hectic travel schedule. The park flowers are gorgeous. Super location. Daragh is a very nice guy. If there is something/anything he can do to help you, he certainly will. Hes eager to make thoughtful suggestions, and hes a very congenial host. His restaurant suggestions are especially excellent. However, I found the apartment to be in poor shape in terms of being worn, and in terms of a serious brown and black mold problem in the bathroom within the grout throughout the shower/bath area. I shared all of this with Daragh after my stay, as none of the worn or mold problems could have been remedied during my stay. They all require a period of maintenance when the apartment isnt in use, otherwise Im sure Daragh would have tried to help. I found the laminate flooring to be very worn and in serious need of replacing. I understand from Daragh that the apartment is scheduled to be painted in early June, and thats great because it really does need it. The doors are very scuffed and worn. There are black water stains on the wooden countertops around the kitchen sink that looks really bad. Ive stayed in more than 18 different apartment rentals in Europe and the US, and Ive never come across an apartment in this kind of worn condition. It was especially surprising and disappointing given so many positive reviews. I can only guess that the kinds of things that Ive mentioned here that disappointed me are the kinds of things that simply didnt bother the people who wrote those reviews. Everyone is different and has a different personal perspective. I get that. Ive been very honest about everything Ive mentioned here, and I hope it will help you in making your own decision about the apartment you ultimately decide to rent in awesome Dublin. And it certainly is awesome. I also hope my review will encourage Daragh to continue making improvements to the apartment. Best of luck to you on your upcoming vacation!"
451611,432293492,4/3/2019,Very nice apartment with a great view :)
451611,432921475,4/5/2019,The view from the apartment and the communication with the hosts were spectacular!
451611,434116338,4/7/2019,"I really enjoyed my time at the apartment.
The apartment is really central and is only a short walk from a number of major attractions such as Temple Bar and the Guinness Storehouse. 

Daragh is really helpful and provides a lot of useful information about the city which helped us make the most of our trip, and helped us arrange early access to the property to ensure that we could leave our bags and explore Dublin ASAP.

Thanks again!"
451611,434700591,4/8/2019,Amazing location with a beautiful view! Incredible local tips. Daragh was really friendly and helpful when we got lost on our way from the airport.
451611,436167439,4/12/2019,Daraghs place was great! The location was ideal for all the best sights of Dublin. The flat was perfect for us and Daragh was brilliant with tips for great places to eat and drink!
451611,439145473,4/18/2019,Sarah and Edgar were wonderful hosts.  If we make it back to Dublin I hope we can stay there again.
451611,441806549,4/22/2019,"We had an amazing time. The apartment was great! Very good location with easy walk to Temple Bar, Guinness, and other major areas.  Very much appreciated the quick communication to help with checkin and provide us with recommendations for the local area. Would definitely be happy to stay there again!!"
451611,442716334,4/24/2019,"Terrific reception upon arrival. Apartment is well located across from a coffee shop, cathedral and park.  A bit noisy from the street with the windows open during the day and evening due to traffic, which was better at night. However, earplugs were welcome. Lovely small balcony overlooking St Patricks Park and St Patricks Cathedral is a bonus."
451611,443663470,4/26/2019,Very nice stay at this conveniently located apartment. If it were my apartment I would add living room curtains (the window is open to the busy downtown street) and make a bit more efficient use of the small apartment and bedroom size but it is a perfect location and was good for simply a place to sleep and relax for the evening. Thank you Daragh!
451611,445421062,4/29/2019,"Overall good experience. Great location and good tipps, especially the legit coffee co for breakfast."
451611,446852109,5/2/2019,"Great hosts, very amazing location!So close to everything! Very walkable even with a baby! Loved having morning coffee out on the beautiful patio. Thanks for the lovely experience and awesome recommendations!"
451611,447354080,5/3/2019,"We never met Daragh in person, but he was extremely responsive. One of Daragh's local friends met us personally and let us in, along with giving us some local travel tips. The apartment location is great - easy 20 minute walk to some great sites."
451611,449264569,5/6/2019,There is nowhere better to stay in Dublin!! We were walking distance to everything we wanted to do and Daragh left a great list of local places to try. He was very quick to reply to questions and genuinely seemed to care that we were having a great experience. Recommend Daragh highly!
451611,450454556,5/9/2019,"Look no further! This spot is perfect! Perfect location, amazingly clean, and a great host. We couldnt have been happier! Book it now!!"
451611,451270808,5/11/2019,This place is ideal for staying in Dublin.  Forget the hotels and stay here.  You can walk to everything youre wanting to see and you actually get a feel of the city.  What a nice place!
451611,454485612,5/18/2019,"Overall a wonderful experience! Great communication, great local tips and recommendations for the area. Space was as destructed. Location was perfect for Dublin with St.Patricks cathedral in sight from the the balcony! Would definitely stay again"
451611,458019334,5/25/2019,"Fantastic location, so many thoughtful touches throughout and so safe and secure"
451611,460516151,5/29/2019,Nice appartment near the city centrum and not far from temple bar
451611,460857163,5/30/2019,Daraghs place was perfect. Close to many restaurants and other interesting things!
451611,461378315,5/31/2019,Great location!! Daragh was very responsive and the apartment looks just like the photos.
451611,472698421,6/20/2019,"Daragh and Edgar are great hosts and very helpful with easy communication. The flat was beautiful and really in the best possible location for exploring Dublin for the first time. 
Dinner on the balcony each evening was a big highlight! Very grateful to have found this spot :-)"
451611,475529932,6/24/2019,"Location was great and within decent walking distance to everything we wished to do in town. Hosts had great communication and plenty of recommendations. The flat was well cleaned. Floors, doors and especially the sofa are very worn and tired. - to be fair to guests looking to book either the pictures or the flat need updating accordingly, as do the WiFi login details provided on the app. Difficulty working the shower and sink which had a tendency to turn off and had trouble warming up. Overall a decent stay but not quite as we were expecting."
451611,477554004,6/28/2019,An amazing stay! Great location! Daragh gave some amazing recommendations and provided a comfy apartment!
451611,513983894,8/20/2019,"Great place, great location, great host. Daragh couldnt have been more helpful. Fab place to stay for a get away!"
451611,519854900,8/29/2019,"Great host, available and helpful, Daragh and Edgar made our long weekend so easy, they gave awesome tips and the location is just perfect !"
451611,524713954,9/6/2019,"Perfect location for visiting Dublin! Daragh was always quick to anwer any questions. The apartment needs some small repairs done, but we did only use it to sleep, so it didnt bother us. We had a great time in Dublin :)"
451611,527243016,9/10/2019,"perfect location
no nightstands
floor of the bathroom slidy"
451611,528082994,9/12/2019,"Great stay, definitely recommend!"
451611,532237943,9/19/2019,"What a wonderful place from which to launch your Dublin excursions. It's in a quiet part of town, but easily walkable to key sites such as St. Stephen's Green, nightlife in the Liberties, Trinity College, the riverfront and more. Daragh also supplied us with many tips for what to do and where to go. Very helpful. Would love to stay here again on a future trip to Dublin."
451611,534128537,9/22/2019,Great location and an attentive host who will be able to provide you with great places around the apartment. A perfect base to explore Dublin with the hop-on/off bus stop just over the road! Apartment is a little more tired than the pictures let on.
451611,536318307,9/26/2019,Wonderful space and location :)
451611,539490679,10/1/2019,"We stayed at this apartment for 3 nights and were happy with the apartment. Communication with the hosts was always really fast and they also recommended a lot of local places for us to find food, drinks and nice places to visit. The apartment was at the perfect location indeed and it was close to everything you might want to visit. We didn't even need to take the bus once as everything was at walking distance. The apartment felt homey and we were happy with the apartment. As some others mentioned in their reviews, it doesn't resemble the pictures that well anymore, as it a bit worn out and in need of some fixings. But it didn't really bother us as we only were at the apartment at night to sleep (perfect bed btw). So in the end we were glad we chose this apartment due to its location and the quick helpfulness of the hosts :)."
451611,539879339,10/2/2019,"Great, very comfortable apartment and location"
451611,541423561,10/5/2019,This place was AMAZING! The hosts were so kind and accommodating for our trip. The location is AWESOME! My friend and I could have a nice beer on the patio and look out at the park. So amazing!
451611,542276476,10/6/2019,"Good location. Host was great at timely communication and allowed early check-in, which we appreciated. Clean, however, many items and areas were not in good repair. We did not have access to the building complex security gate and were instructed to contort our arms, stick our hand and entire arm through the gap in the gate, and press the button. This was not secure and put us at risk for muscle injury. We were disappointed with our experience here. Depending on your expectations/tolerance, you may have no issue with this place, as it does have many upsides. We would stay in a hotel or different Airbnb next time if we were to visit the area again."
451611,544121041,10/9/2019,This flat was good situated and the flat was very bright nice.  But there were some problems to get hot water in the kitchen. The dishwasher was out of order.  The temperature in shower was difficult to adjust. The big bed was too hard for us. Thise things could easily be fixed and then the apartment would be very nice.
451611,544880912,10/11/2019,Fantastic location! Walked everywhere we wanted to see! Perfect for the young traveler.
451611,546952406,10/14/2019,"Lovely location and good communication with the host. Apartment is very dated compared to the photos, however its a great space with the added bonus of a balcony."
451611,547927850,10/16/2019,"Daragh was a really wonderful host. He had so many great suggestions for our time in Dublin. The place is perfectly located to walk to anything and was in a great quiet, safe neighborhood."
451611,548326076,10/17/2019,"Great location. Clean, simple accommodation for a night or two. Daragh is exceptional and gives great tips and is quick to respond to all communication."
451611,552332643,10/21/2019,"Great location, view, and living room!"
451611,553989400,10/25/2019,Great location and very clean.
451611,555168219,10/27/2019,"Great location, great value, and great hospitality! We particularly liked that this property is just slightly separated from the busiest part of the city, but were within 10 minutes walking to just about any location that we wanted to go to. Would definitely stay here again!"
451611,558915975,11/3/2019,"He was so helpful and kind, even he bought dessert for us;) he always respond instantly. location was perfect. The flat was clean and comfortable. Thank you for everything. You are the best host;)"
454183,460109385,5/28/2019,"This was a great place to stay, it was qwirky as advertised. Easy to check in and out and only minutes from the city center. Bus stops in both directions and great pub locations down the hill. Phenix park and Dublin zoo walking distance from the place."
454183,462618184,6/2/2019,What a fun place to stay! I felt like a little kid again in a lot of ways staying in a fort or something. Eddie is a fantastic host. Helpful in giving local tips and suggestions! Would recommend Eddie as a host to anyone visiting Dublin.
454183,465816108,6/8/2019,"We had a lovely time at Eddie's place. The location is great, very quiet and safe and the studio is charming! Eddie is a wonderful host, helpful and available."
454183,469879235,6/15/2019,"A nice cozy room that is in a great location, we took in the scenery at the park which was an excellent walk.  If you are hoping to walk out your door into Temple Bar this isn't for you.   The bus access and taxi fares are reasonable."
454183,472339409,6/19/2019,Eddie was a fantastic host. The location was perfect. We enjoyed our stay and would 100% return next time in Dublin.
454183,473834990,6/22/2019,"Eddie was an outstanding host, very communicative and helpful of all our needs.  The Airbnb studio had a lot of character, was quite small, but had everything we needed.  Loved the skylight window in the bedroom, looking out it at night and hearing the animals from the nearby zoo was amazing. His place is located close to the hop on hop off bus stop that we used to get around.  I would definitely reccomend his place to others!"
454183,475977286,6/25/2019,"Eddie,s is very personable great host. We had a lovely stay."
454183,479694091,7/1/2019,Great place to stay! A bit tight for three people but we knew that going in. Great location. Eddie was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Dublin.
454183,490229422,7/18/2019,"Eddies place is great! Just perfect for those who want a comfortable, quirky, and easy-to-get-to place in Dublin without all the noise of city center."
454183,493855742,7/23/2019,"This apartment is great because it is so easy to get to everything. We enjoyed walking  in Phoenix Park and took Bus 46 into the middle of Dublin often. In fact, its so close to the zoo, you could hear the lions settling in for the night, every evening. Its a great location and the apartment works well too. Eddie was quick to reply anytime we had a question and an incredibly amenable host."
454183,501930142,8/4/2019,"I think that calling it ""quirky "" is fine, but should definitely be described as small, especially if it is offered to 3 people. The day bed is very uncomfortable as either a couch or a bed. This home is lovely unfortunately for us, we were just too cramped and unable to get a full night's sleep on the beds. Eddie was a wonderful host, and I'd recommend the place to anyone"
454183,504856232,8/8/2019,Great spot! We spent our first 3 nights in Ireland here while we got acclimated to the culture and lifestyle. Eddies place is in a great location and was very comfortable and cozy.
454183,507259064,8/11/2019,Very close to a nice park and close to downtown safe neighborhood
454183,513194087,8/19/2019,"Nice studio, prefect for two people, a little bit to small for tree. Very clean. 
Private bathroom outside but near by the studio. Nice and quite residence, less than 10 minutes away from the tram station (Heuston station), coffee shops, pubs, etc...
Very friendly host.
Less than than 30‚Ç¨ by taxi from the airport"
454183,523712551,9/4/2019,Ed was an amazing host. He was super polite and gave us great places to see that were more local than the tourist places to see. The area is beautiful and the home is really cool with fun history. Ed was very accommodating and all around amazing to meet.
454183,530076880,9/15/2019,"Exactly as advertised: a quirky apartment with a kitchen and living area and little bedroom up the ladder. The bathroom is out in the hall. About a 10 minute walk to the bus lines that take you to the center in 10-15 minutes. Everything was clean and Ed gave us a list of really good recommendations for local fare and fun. Nice for two people, a bit tight for three; the sofa downstairs had a horizontal bar at about shoulder level that is not so comfortable to sleep on. But it was all fine and quite good for the price."
454183,533929517,9/22/2019,"The apartment is very nice, it is in a good neighborhood and close to the Phoenix Park, very good location since this allows you to walk through the park without having to go too far (it's a good place for running). About the center of the city, it is a little far if you want to go walk (in fact, only about 15-20 minutes) but it is very well connected, so this is not a problem. Finally, I think that the ideal for this apartment is for 2 people, but we have been three people there for a whole week and we have not had any problems. The host is very kind and friendly. If I return to Dublin, I would repeat this appartment."
454183,536323525,9/26/2019,"Great host, very friendly and willing to help with any questions you may have. Nice spot to stay in."
468082,418977417,3/3/2019,Excellent place and service
468082,422498476,3/11/2019,Great location! The village of Lucan was a great spot to have dinner. We also appreciated breakfast in the morning along with tea and coffee! Checking in and out was easy.
468082,424218033,3/16/2019,"Very clean, pretty apartment with loads of details. We loved the breakfast and the dog."
468082,427283358,3/23/2019,"Great hospitality, great stay"
468082,427788825,3/24/2019,"Such a pleasant experience. I highly recommend!  I stayed here with my mom and brother. We arrived late in the evening and left the following morning, enroute to the airport.  The host was kind enough to wake up early and put out a lovely breakfast in the morning. It was a pleasant surprise."
468082,429251497,3/27/2019,"Siobhan was very welcoming to her lovely home.  We had a nice, but brief, rest before our plane departure the next morning.  Comfortable beds and delicious breakfast!  The route to the airport is easy, although one might  expect 30-45+ minutes to the airport during rush hour."
468082,434034747,4/7/2019,"Very happy with our Airbnb.
Very friendly. Very comfortable and clean."
468082,436524782,4/13/2019,Wonderful home and a sweet and welcoming family. Highly recommend this home!
468082,439517536,4/19/2019,"Siobhans rooms are beautifully decorated, bright and comfortable. The dining area is also gorgeous, and the cooked breakfast was a nice touch. The house grounds are spacious and include a couple of seating areas surrounded by garden. Our only regret is that we stayed just one night."
468082,440028609,4/20/2019,Highly recommended if you stay in Dublin. SIiobhan's house is so comfy and she cooked a perfact breakfast for us! Also she offered some useful suggestion about our trip. BTW she has a beautiful garden and a lovely yard.
468082,440837584,4/21/2019,"After a long day of travel, we stayed at Siobhans place and were bummed that it was only a stop over. Her home is beautiful and hospitality is amazing. Best nights sleep Ive had in a long time. Breakfast was extremely tasty and in an absolutely beautiful dining room. Very helpful with local tips of town and transportation options. Definitely recommend and would be happy if our travels brought us back."
468082,444659493,4/28/2019,Such a beautiful property!!  Siobhan made our stay exceptional!!
468082,447910118,5/4/2019,Twee kamers aan het einde van de gang van hun eigen huis. De gemeenschappelijke ruimte is niet alleen voor de huurder. Fijn ontbijtje.

468082,457961667,5/25/2019,"The rooms were very nicely put together, and Siobhan was very welcoming. The breakfast was also delicious."
468082,458769474,5/26/2019,The Fairy House was a beautiful and comfortable house to stay in. It was an easy commute to the Dublin Airport. Siobhan was a wonderful hostess and made us a delicious breakfast.
468082,464237514,6/5/2019,Fantastic place. Wonderful breakfast and the location is great.
468082,465815352,6/8/2019,Siobhan was SO kind and thoughtful! She ordered our cab for us in the morning and said she would have breakfast ready for us earlier than normal so as to accommodate our departure. We were expecting toast and cereal - she provided homemade French toast and bacon!!! And then special made an egg for our little boy so he could fill up his tummy with something good before his flight  we would definitely recommend Siobhans place and would stay here again!
468082,469172507,6/14/2019,Beautiful home in great location I totally recommend it
468082,475945389,6/25/2019,Great place to stay  for a visit to Dublin .  Worked very well for our  small  family . Gracious and kind hosts .
468082,477522488,6/28/2019,Great host and breakfast. Rooms are nice decorated.
468082,480769010,7/3/2019,Amazing location to explore Dublin. We had 2 toddlers with us so the grounds and the trampoline provided great sport for them. Great breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere. Very enjoyable overall.
468082,482993459,7/7/2019,"We felt very fooled by Siobhan's listing as we were literally staying in the two spare rooms in her house living in amongst her and her 4 children. The bedroom doors have keyholes however we weren't given keys so our bedrooms containing or valuables were constantly unlocked leaving anyone in the house free to roam in. I've stayed at several air bnb's in the past and I've always had a key for my bedroom door, we felt quite unsafe by the arrangement. It was a very very strange set up, we  had one ensuite bathroom and then had the share the main family bathroom with her sons. . very awkward when you're waking back to your room in a towel and bump into one of her teenage sons!! The location was perfect as we had a party close by however, I would 100% never stay here again."
468082,486974403,7/13/2019,Good location for travelling onwards after arrival at Dublin airport. Nice pub close by for a beer and music
468082,489281689,7/16/2019,We had a lovely stay in this eclectic home with very welcoming hosts.
468082,492305759,7/21/2019,"Siobhan is the essence of what AirBNB is! A fantastic home with lovely bed, great facilities and an amazing weekend breakfast. Being this family home makes is a very welcoming and safe place and we never felt like us or our belongings were ever at risk. 

Siobhan and her family are absolutely amazing and were an absolute delight to have a chat with. They are certainly not overbearing in any way shape or form and we had plenty of space.

I would 100% stay here again and I look forward to a return trip to Dublin soon."
468082,504307737,8/7/2019,Everything was perfect.  It was a pleasure to stay in the beautiful home that is named Fairyland.  We were greeted by their sweet golden retriever and enjoyed walking up the stairs lined with lavender.  Siobhan recommended a local restaurant Carrolls which wound up being one of the best meals we had in Ireland.  After a restful night sleep Siobhan cooked us a delicious early breakfast at 7am because we had to catch our flight home.  Highly recommend!
468082,508155179,8/12/2019,A truly lovely place to stay. The hosts were amazing. Couldnt do enough to help. Breakfast was very tasty over the weekend and local knowledge helped with our holiday.
468082,509994366,8/15/2019,"Group of work colleagues stayed here one night before a wedding. Big house, lots of space. Would be good to know which areas are in/off bounds. Lovely breakfast - but early but much appreciated before a wedding!"
468082,510642569,8/16/2019,"The Fairy House is truly lovely! The town of Lucan didn't disappoint. There are several charming pubs within a short 5 min walk. The grounds and setting are beautiful. House is inviting and Siobhan was very accomodating to our family. She was quick to respond to multiple questions. She had croissants and coffee out for our very early morning departure. She booked a cab for us the night before. So many very nice things about this property and the family who lives here. Its an ideal location for traveling to the airport and value for money is excellent.

Only thing I would mention, is that this is a household with teenagers. We experienced a little loud music, pizza deliveries, family conversations and late night phone conversations as well as tiptoeing past the children's and master bedroom to get to our own rooms which felt a little awkward-especially having to catch a cab at 6:30 am while the house slept.

We travel a lot and have stayed at quite a few airbnbs and vacation rentals by owner. This situation was a first for us. It wasn't bad,  just unique and something I think guests need to be aware of. I'm sure it was my mistake in booking in not understanding the dynamic of the property. This is a fantastic home and the hospitality was outstanding."
468082,512509356,8/18/2019,Useful stopover on the way to the port.
468082,516260072,8/24/2019,"Siobhan house is a very charming B&B in the outskirts of Dublin. There is a 5 minute walk to Lucan village, where some pubs are located. Also the bus stop is in Lucan village, the bus to Dublin city centre takes about 25 minutes. We can highly recommend Siobhan and her fairy house for a trip to Dublin."
468082,522527258,9/2/2019,Excellent location with easy public transport into Dublin. Comfortable rooms and the use of a huge sitting room just for guests. The cooked breakfast every morning gave us stamina for long days of seeing the city. Siobhan was very helpful and her household has a nice relaxed feeling. Highly recommend this place.
468082,524187550,9/5/2019,"Fairy house was easy to find and really cute. Lovely family and we felt very comfortable.  Quick walk to a cute village.
Comfortable,  clean and delicious breakfast made our stay enjoyable. Siobhan is a very friendly,  welcoming host. Would highly recommend"
468082,524714162,9/6/2019,Great place close to city!
468082,528025855,9/12/2019,"Siobhan made our stay more than comfortable.  She and her family were engaging, trusting, and caring.  The beds were perfect, the house is amazing, and even the family dog was welcoming and friendly.  We would stay with Siobhan again."
468082,533967041,9/22/2019,The fairy house is in the perfect location. A 5 minute walk from the adorable village of Lucan that you will not want to miss. Siobhan was a fantastic host and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there.
468082,537207703,9/28/2019,"Siobhan was a wonderful host. My only regret is that we did not get to spend more time there. Love stay in a beautiful, charming home."
468082,541492930,10/5/2019,Auch das zweite mal hat alles wunderbar geklappt. Kann diese Unterkunft nur jedem empfehlen!
468082,546953718,10/14/2019,Siobhan was quick to respond to my questions. She has a lovely home with comfortable beds. She left a great breakfast for us in the morning. We only wish we had more time to stay and enjoy it!
468082,554426175,10/26/2019,Beautiful and cosy place!
468082,562025259,11/10/2019,"Lovely house, wonderful hosts, can't say enough nice things about Fairy House"
497136,454966366,5/19/2019,Cozy house!
497136,458754881,5/26/2019,"A comfortable room on the edge of downtown Dublin. 

Close to the Dart train if you're going out of the downtown area, and close to bus route #1 which comes every 20 minutes or so. A little inconvenient to reach from the airport if using public transit, and expect a cab to cost 40 euro or so with traffic."
497136,468766631,6/13/2019,"Despite me booking only a day in advance Norah and Audrey went out of their way to make sure everything was ready for me. Felt very welcome. Made me realise how much I prefer staying somewhere with a home feeling rather than a hotel with a tv and kettle in every room. Nice location. Just round the corner is the nature reserve and the lighthouse which Audrey recommended, and which were great for an evening run."
497136,471817889,6/18/2019,"The good
The place is located in a very nice and safe area. There is a grocery store 10 minutes away and a lot of restaurants (there is a burger place 10 minutes away, BuJo, that is superb!). 2 minutes away is the bus stop that takes you to downtown (its a 20 minutes ride, but the public transport is great and comfortable), and to my taste the neighborhood is way prettier than downtown Dublin. 
The room is very spacious, and the bed is very comfy. The main restroom is very pretty and you get a good shower.

The not so good.
You should be aware that it is possible, as it happened to me, that the three rooms in the house are rented to other travelers, and so that you are paying to stay in a guest house. The way the space is described, and some of the comments in the past reviews, made it seems as if Norah has one room to rent and that she and her family live in the same house. And so, someone like me, could want to rent the space to interact with the locals in their own home. My experience was as follows: 1. I do not know Norah at all (or any local living in the house). 2. The house has 3 rooms each one of which was rented to visitors. 3. From expecting to be hosted by locals, I soon realized that I was paying to be in a guest house (with zero interactions with locals and all the problems of sharing a house with people who do not own the house and dont care whether they have cleaned after themselves in the common areas.). 
In addition, there is no way for you to lock your door when you leave the house (and, as I say,  there are other travelers in the same house), and there is no safe to keep your valuables. 
There will be some milk, cereal, bread and coffee for breakfast, but depending on the other guests you might not want to use the kitchen if it is extremely dirty (the fridge had a horrible smell)."
497136,478883224,6/30/2019,Great stay - Nora was quick to respond to any questions. Easy stroll into the city. Parkrun just 200m away.
497136,482236828,7/6/2019,Norah's place was super cute and the bed was very comfy. Nice sized bathroom. The lock on the front door is a little tricky but that in no way hindered our stay. We really enjoyed Norah's house.
497136,495698987,7/26/2019,Great location nice quiet neighbourhood
519416,419082667,3/3/2019,"very nice host, central location , clean and cosy room."
519416,425503634,3/18/2019,Sonia was very prompt in responding to my messages. She gave great recommendations for local food and drink. Sonia even allowed us to check-in before our designated time to better accommodate our travel plans. Her cat was super friendly as well!
519416,431961879,4/2/2019,"The location is amazing, best spot in Dublin, walk everywhere. I had a very nice stay at Sonias apartment, she was always gentle and available. Thanks!"
519416,437150051,4/14/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin in a very central area.
519416,439178249,4/18/2019,All information perfectly as described. Sonia was responsive and welcoming me personally although I arrived in the middle of the night.
519416,440122526,4/20/2019,"Sonia took such great care of me arriving in Dublin on my last night traveling in Ireland. I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed and convenient, private room. Also, cutest little cat ever!! The apartment was conveniently close and short walking distance to all the greatest downtown Dublin has to offer. Enjoy the music, cuisine and ambiance of Dublin at Sonia's place!"
519416,448546515,5/5/2019,"Posizione splendida , casa confortevole e Sonia una persona speciale ... bella esperienza"
519416,453298838,5/15/2019,"Sonia was a kind and gracious host.  The room and bathroom were clean and very comfortable.  The slippers and snacks were a nice touch.

519416,462794698,6/2/2019,"Sonia is a wonderful person. Very friendly, helpful, and nice. She is a perfect host. I recommande her place not only for her hospitality but also for the place: a nice, big room, very clean, near a very clean bathroom. The bed is so comfortable, I wish I can have one like that! The location is perfect, very central: near O'Connell St and Temple bar, and there are a lot of shopping, food, transportation all around. The place is very very quiet too. And her cat is amazing. I had a wonderful stay and I hope I can come back. Thank you Sonia."
519416,470683170,6/16/2019,"The room was large, clean and well equipped -she had maps and even some orange juices and energy bars for emergencies :). House was quiet and close to downtown and main transport routes. 
Sonia was extremely kind. Arrival was easy to arrange and communication was fluent all along. She even had some good suggestions for moving around the city. 
I do recomend her place."
519416,475465262,6/24/2019,Sonia was very friendly and welcoming and her home was in an excellent location.  Near everything but quiet
519416,482427518,7/6/2019,"Sonia's place was perfect for my business travel needs. Her detailed communication made finding her apartment and the check-in process smooth and easy. The double bed was quiet comfortable and the room very quiet. I slept well. The bathroom was spacious and located directly across from the bedroom door and just off the entryway. That gave me full privacy in the late evening and early morning. The wifi was very good. Sonia left two bottles of water and some crackers in the room, appreciated after a long day traveling. The location on the northside of the Liffey just west of the Ha'penney Bridge is convenient to city centre and there are several convenient restaurants and coffee shops next door."
519416,501244467,8/3/2019,"Wonderful location at an amazing price!  The host was lovely to meet, and the stay made the trip to Dublin quite hassle-free"

Thank you Sonia I had a great time :-)"
519416,523305244,9/3/2019,"Perfect location and was pretty much walking distance to all attractions and bus/tram routes.  I travelled solo and felt incredibly safe in this district. 

The room is spacious and clean! 

Sonia offered many local tips and was always available to assist.  

Would stay here again."
519416,533343792,9/21/2019,My stay at Sonias place was perfect. The location is very handy and close to anything you might want to visit in Dublin. The bed is large and comfortable. No noise whatsoever at night. I would definitely recommend it.
519416,536806546,9/27/2019,"Sonia's room was central, close to everything (pubs, restaurants, shops, landmarks) and sparkling clean. She was really helpful, friendly and polite. I'd recommend her room to anyone!"
519416,558605444,11/3/2019,"Sonia was very nice and her place clean. There is a cat FYI (in case you have allergies, which I didn't know about till I arrived). The building is very secure which was great."
519416,562092940,11/10/2019,"My visit was very quick in Dublin but Sonia and I could coordinate our schedulings (arrive, batchroom usage, leaving) well. She was nice and her place to."

522667,427325716,3/23/2019,"What a great find! Karin's apartment is amazing, and so is she! Very helpful and friendly, really goes above and beyond to make sure you get the most out of your stay in Dublin. Great access to transportation (5-10 minutes walk to various bus stops/hop on hop off pick up points), as well as walk able to the temple bar area (took us about 25-30 minutes). Looking forward to our next trip to Dublin and will definitely be staying at Karin's apartment again!"
522667,429547175,3/28/2019,"Karins place is beautiful and in a great location. She provided fruit and homemade bread, which was appreciated. 

However, there was too much information in the listing, the house book, and the messages I received from Karin. There was some conflicting information that made the check-in and general stay a bit confusing. 

Once we arrived, we couldnt find the bedding for the cot and the heat was off. I called Karin to ask where we could find the bedding and asked about the heat. She walked me through how to reset the boiler light to turn the heat back on. I had to do this 3 times in the 5 days we were there.

Karin told me I was supposed to let her know ahead of arriving that we would be using the cot. This expectation wasnt clear in the listing. 

About 45 minutes after our phone conversation, Karin came to the apartment to give us bedding for the cot, but was not polite and welcoming. We asked if we could help move the furniture to set up the cot and she looked at us, but did not respond, then she moved the couch herself with a shove and a deep sigh.

In addition to these experiences, the bathroom door handle and one of the locks on the apartment door were malfunctioning during our visit. Karin wrote in a message to me that both have been repaired since our departure.

Overall our stay was pleasant, but updating the information in the listing and in the house book will help future guests get the most current information and avoid confusing and frustrating interactions between guest and host."
522667,430361020,3/30/2019,This place is fantastic. It's in a Georgian home with many of the original features. It's an easy walk to O'Connell Street and all that central Dublin has to offer. There could be a bit of street noise at times but it didn't bother me.  Karin and all of my hosts in Ireland were very friendly and helpful and really helped to make my trip to Ireland spectacular.
522667,432891694,4/5/2019,We had a great time! Karin is a great host. She popped in both nights we were there to say Hi and ask if we needed anything. It was very thoughtful and really nice to meet her. It was also great because it gave us an opportunity to ask about a few things around town. She really knows her stuff and are very thankful for everything. Highly recommended.
522667,442815400,4/24/2019,"What you can expect from Karin is amazing service, detailed information specific to your trip and how to maximize your time in Ireland. She gave us some great advice prior to landing and upon our arrival we had excellent information to plan our days. The rental space was beautiful. Great touches and wonderful little treats in the refrigerator."
522667,444155253,4/27/2019,This was a very cool building to stay in. Karin also gave us a lot of really good local tips for getting around. I would recommend.
522667,446388636,5/1/2019,"Wonderful stay...close to City Center, all buses and rail station. Easy walking distance to all center and fashionable quarters. Thanks, Kate"
522667,447931507,5/4/2019,Karins place is wonderful and full of character. She was available to give us recommendations for dinner and was quick to help us when we accidentally locked our keys inside! Located in a great neighborhood about a 20 minute walk to the city center.
522667,454064272,5/17/2019,"Beautifully-appointed, spacious apartment overlooking the park and neighborhood. We love to walk and found it very easy to get around. Karin is a very helpful host and I highly recommend staying here."
522667,455858195,5/20/2019,"Karin was easy to communicate with and was quick to respond. She had left detailed instructions on everything in the apartment and a lot of useful information about the neighborhood.
Her apartment was very nice and we had a good stay."
522667,456777523,5/22/2019,"This flat is a wonderful, historical place to call ""home"" while you're in Dublin. Karin is a thoughtful, responsive host who provides great information and local tips. The flat itself is warm and inviting. The kitchen and bathroom have everything you need to be comfortable. The location is great -- close enough to nightlife or tourist fun, but just off that beaten path so you can experience everyday Dublin. We would gladly stay here again and encourage you to!"
522667,458716692,5/26/2019,"Genuinely one of the nicest places I've ever stayed in.  Huge floor to ceiling windows - Karin had left fresh eggs, milk, coffee, tea, fruit and yogurts etc for us - so I sat by the window after check-in and just relaxed and watched the world go by with a huge pot of coffee.  Karin had a booklet with lots of great tips on where to go locally for food, drinks, shopping etc which was great for me as I'm not overly familiar with Dublin.  I always end up going to the same overpopulated tourist traps so having her local knowledge was amazing.  One of my favourite trips away ever"
522667,460053224,5/28/2019,"We loved Karins place!  The view is amazing and the decor enhanced our experience.  She thoughtfully had adapters in each plug in, fresh fruit and cooking necessities.  Wish we had planned to stay longer than 2 days.   The location was easily walkable and public transportation all around.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Doug and Kelly, Canada"
522667,464788354,6/6/2019,"Fantastic, stylish compact apartment within walking distance of the city centre. Great communication, highly recommended!"
522667,467406468,6/10/2019,"The apartment is really gorgeous and its an one-of-a-kind experience. The place is extremely clean and the location close to center. Everything is well thought out. Even if it is on a noisy street, it is truly worth it."
522667,470594181,6/16/2019,"I selected the 'better than we expected' option when reviewing Karin's flat. However, I feel that gives the impression that we didn't expect a lot from the flat when in reality we were expecting a high standard given the positive reviews and Karin succeeded in surpassing  these high expectations, much to our delight! We greatly appreciated the provision of fruit juice and eggs etc. it was such a thoughtful addition and brought instant relaxation after a busy morning of travel (and filled our hungry bellies).  Karin even provided some toiletries which was another lovely touch. 
Karin was incredibly flexible with our travel arrangements and was happy to store our bags for us both before check-in and after the check-out time which meant we could really see the most of Dublin. 
We would be delighted to stay with Karin again if the opportunity arises, I cannot sing Karin's praises highly enough."
522667,472220986,6/19/2019,"The place was great.  All the space we needed, coffee maker, and adapters to help with keeping our electronics charged.  Is on a busy street, so there is traffic noise after a certain hour.  Still, found everything else to be better than expected."
522667,478804556,6/30/2019,"Ive had a wonderful stay at Karins Georgian studio. Communication on forehand was great, with handy tips and explanations. Welcoming was warm and Karin took the time, was very friendly. There were a lot of extra goodies in the fridge and I;ve felt so welcome. On departure, my flight went hours after checking out: no problem, Karin let me put my luggage in the hall, so I could go signtseeing (I went to beautiful Howth). Very recommending!!!"
522667,483347663,7/7/2019,"Came to Dublin for a concert in croke park. This apartment is literally round the corner, cheaper than a hotel with far better facilities and added extras. Would definitely stay here again!"
522667,485610988,7/11/2019,"We had a great stay! The location was great for us, just a couple minutes walk from O'Connell street and the Spire, and a really easy walk on towards the river. Great access to North Dublin sites. Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby, and views of Mountjoy Square Park right across the street! Inside, the home is absolutely beautiful, a well-maintained Georgian mansion, with amazing details that continue in the apartment itself. Nice private space, fantastic working fireplace, giant windows, and just tons of historical features. Cozy bed in the loft area. Great kitchen, with lovely thoughtful touches, including yogurt, fruit, coffee and more. Check-in was easy and very self-sufficient, and we were able to leave our bags early or late as needed; would definitely stay again! What a great chance to experience Georgian Dublin!"
522667,486988465,7/13/2019,Great Space in a lovely Place!
522667,495712429,7/26/2019,"Kirans flat is one of a kind and her hospitality is unbeatable. We felt so at ease with her that she feels like a family by the end of our visit. The classically decorated flat has everything we needed: from Mocha pot to handheld blender î and the fridge is filled with goodies like yogurt, milk, eggs, and all kinds of seasonings and sauces upon our arrival. One day we even came home to find a tasty walnut malt loaf on our table! The WiFi signal was a bit weak at first, but upon our request, Kiran promptly replied with an immediate solution, and went so far as getting us a brand new shampoo when she found out we had run out of it. She has the most useful tips for exploring and getting around the city/country too.  Kiran is a hidden treasure and so is her flat. We would definitely stay with her again."
522667,497296012,7/28/2019,"When we arrived, it was late in the evening, but Karin had left us easy-to-follow instructions on how to access the apartment ourselves. The house the apartment is in is beautiful, and the apartment itself is gorgeous as well (that chandelier!) There were three of us, and there was a rollaway bed provided so no one had to sleep on the couch (which is a bit hard, but it matched the aesthetic of the place.) There was also fresh fruit waiting for us in the kitchen, which was a nice touch. The location is unbeatable too. Overall an excellent place to stay for our weekend in Ireland!"
522667,504289947,8/7/2019,"We had a wonderful stay at Karin's place in Dublin, and a very warm and easy welcome. The studio is filled with interesting decorative touches and is both roomy and lovely to be in.  It's also a great location to many sites.  Very happy with our experience."
522667,508092174,8/12/2019,"Really nice apartment, but street outside is very busy."
522667,512453375,8/18/2019,Splendid place.
522667,518090084,8/26/2019,"Karin is a great host. Her recommendations are spot on and she is a prompt and clear communicator. If you rent the flat on the street (number 3), it can be a little noisy."
522667,525084278,9/7/2019,"Great place to stay, beautiful views of the park, amazing space. Loved it."
522667,528015240,9/12/2019,"A lovely spot in a real Dublin neighborhood. The space was beautifully decorated with a library of Irish and Dublin travel books. Loft arrangement was fine for us since we are both under 58ù. If you are 5 10ù or over I might expect some head bumps.  Karin was gracious but responsive and efficient 

Favorite nearby pub was Ned Kellys Hogans Stand. Ask about the sneaky shortcut out the backdoor of the pub!  

Easy to use AirCoach from the airport drops you just south of Parnell street about 10 minute walk away. Take a left and then Slight uphill walk to the park. 

Highly recommend if you want to be out of the hubbub of the Temple Bar etc."
522667,529198298,9/14/2019,"This place is charming and beautiful. We were able to walk to every part of Dublin from here. The giant windows look out into the park, so picturesque! Feels like home. It is a little loud at night, so earplugs recommended."
522667,530885730,9/16/2019,"Karin was easy to communicate with, her space is beautifully decorated and so unique!"
522667,532301709,9/19/2019,"A special gem of a place, inspiring and beautifully authentic. The host Karin offers an Irish warmth which removes all the stress of travel and eases you into Dublins culture.  The surroundings will certainly inspire the creatives and romantics."
522667,534850137,9/23/2019,"This is a wonderful place with many special touches:  fragrant lilies in the foyer, beautiful linens and throw on the bed, fruit, eggs, butter, coffee, tea and other basics in the kitchen, and a first-rate library of guide books and Irish novels.  Karin is warm, intelligent, knowledgable and an all-around excellent host.   It's hard to imagine a nicer, cosier place to stay in Dublin."
522667,535875100,9/25/2019,Such a great and beautiful loft central to everything. Karin is quick to respond and was very helpful with communicating tips and tricks for navigating the city. She also allowed me to drop my stuff off early so that I could explore. The loft itself is beautiful and fully stocked. Perfect for a lovely retreat. Would highly recommend.
522667,537277745,9/28/2019,"Beautiful apartment. Karin was a lovely host. She went over the interesting history of the house, and provided us with milk, eggs, coffee and yogurt. Very thoughtful and appreciated."
522667,538796483,9/30/2019,"The interior of this apartment is very impressive. The amenities, kitchen area, bathroom, and living areas are very nice. Although, it is on a busy street and there is a lot of noise from the cars and many buses that pass by. Karin was very kind and quick in her response and communication between her was good. Although, the area surrounding the apartment was mentioned as ""safe"", we did not feel comfortable walking around on the streets in that area of the city."
522667,539923920,10/2/2019,"Karin's Studio is a lovely place to relax in well -appointed comfort in an authentic  but modern Georgian Dublin townhome.  Everything from the Irish breakfast goodies to the guidebooks , literature and and viewing material were exceptional.  I truly appreciated the fireplace  as well. 
The bed was extremely comfortable and cozy. But, if one is a light sleeper, ear plugs are recommended  as the single pane glass (historical ordinance) does little to block out the road noise.  
That aside, it is a beautiful, historical and cozy, romantic abode."
522667,544569419,10/10/2019,Lovely apartment and walking distance to O'Connell Street where the tourist Information centre is located. Connolly Station is also close by and we took the DART train to Howth (25 min journey) a pretty seaside village with a great selection of fish restaurants. The  apartment is located on a busy road and with the single pane windows you will hear road noise.
522667,547458008,10/15/2019,Beautiful space with great amenities and within walking distance from most of Dublin's attractions.
522667,548333459,10/17/2019,"Excellent location, being about 10 minutes from the river and close to lots of local amenities like shops, restaurants and pubs. The space has a cosy but grand feel to it and the facilities in the kitchen are perfect if you want to cook/prepare breakfast; Karin makes sure you have everything you need! Highly recommend for short or long breaks in Dublin."
522667,551426018,10/20/2019,"Karins place was just as described and we had a great stay there. The size was perfect for a couple, and communication was very easy and quick. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
522667,553471634,10/24/2019,It's a cozy flat where there's a bed upstairs for 2 and a cot for another person. The location is amazing! Pubs and great food already within 5 minutes of walking and the city center starts about 10 minutes from the flat.
522667,555143500,10/27/2019,"Fabulous gem! Everything we wanted and more. Karin has been so helpful from the start to the end of our stay. Wonderful breakfast touches, warm home that made us feel so welcome. Cannot recommend highly enough."
522667,561019136,11/8/2019,"The place was spotless, very comfortably decorated. So many extras. The loft is not tall, but neither am I. I slept like a lamb. Super helpful with letting me leave my luggage for a rental car pick-up. Exceeded my expectations."
526767,423155469,3/13/2019,This place had the perfect location. It was right across from Temple Bar. The place was very clean and neat.
526767,425913136,3/19/2019,"This apartment is bright, spacious and lovely, with all amenities provided! Excellent location and Dardo was a great host, very accommodating and patient with us. I would definitely recommend!"
526767,426828820,3/22/2019,"The suite is simple but well equipped if you wish to cook for yourself, good wifi and spacious enough for up to two couples.  Location is about as central as you can get for downtown Dublin.  On a busy road with the road noise subsiding by midnight.  Handy recommendations provided for restaurants, pubs coffee and market/shopping within close walking distance."
526767,427952966,3/24/2019,"Since we did not have our own transportation during our stay here, we were thrilled that it was right across the street from the Hapenny bridge, and all the hot spots were within walking distance.  Just be prepared: being so close to everything does mean a little more street noise at night, but it wasnt so excessive that it kept us awake! The host was fantastic and greeting us upon arrival, and gave several great recommendations.  Would highly recommend this place for those looking for convenience in location."
526767,429248487,3/27/2019,"Amazing location right by HaPenny Bridge and Temple Bar, sparkling clean, responsive and flexible  host!! Thank you!!!"
526767,429880373,3/29/2019,"Dardos place was everything it was described to be.   Clean, comfortable, and equipped with all the necessities you may require. The location cant be beat!  In the heart of everything. While there we walked to everything. No need for a car. Dardo was great as well.  Quick to respond and very welcoming upon arrival. Would definitely book with Dardo again!"
526767,430869516,3/31/2019,We really enjoyed our stay in Dublin. Dardo's apartment is even nicer than it looks in pictures and was spotlessly clean. The apartment is within easy walking distance of almost everything of interest. Dardo was really helpful and friendly before and during our stay. Would absolutely recommend.
526767,432575462,4/4/2019,Great host and location.
526767,443147040,4/25/2019,This place was chic and in the perfect location in Dublin. Close to Temple Bar but without feeling like youre in a touristy area. Will stay again next time Im in Dublin!
526767,444826095,4/28/2019,"We stayed at Dardo's place for a few nights in April.  The apartment met our expectations and accurately reflected the pictures and description noted on Airbnb.  My wife was escatic to see that there was both a hair dryer and straightener in the bathroom.  Dardo quickly answered our questions and was able to accommodate an early check-in request, which was a huge help.  His recommendations for restaurants and pubs were great.  The apartment's location was awesome and was in walking distance to everything.  We would definitely stay at Dardo's place again in the future."
526767,446758541,5/2/2019,"Location, location, location. Darios apartment is a spacious modern space with high ceilings and room to spread out and relax. After a few minutes my wife said  if this place had a drier and washing machine it would be perfectù  2 minutes later she opened a cupboard door to find a hide hole with both. We will be back."
526767,447867761,5/4/2019,"This is a great location. Spacious, stylish, useful room."
526767,449224468,5/6/2019,"Dardos apartment is perfectly located and really beautifully designed. Super spacious and secure, very clean and with all amenities it really is special. We would highly recommend for a long weekend in Dublin!"

526767,460531111,5/29/2019,"Dardo is an expert host, his apartment and hospitality are superior. If you are looking for an urban vibe in the center of Dublin with all amenities then this is your spot. Dardo was excellent at communicating and provided all we could ask and more."
526767,462821961,6/2/2019,"Our first stop in Ireland was fantastic. Dardo's apartment had everything one needed. Our family of 3 were very comfortable. Location can't be beat! Beautiful views!!! Very clean! Local suggestions were wonderful! Convenient for walking everywhere and right on the bus line. We particularly liked The Merchants Arch, right across the river. Live music and fun atmosphere. Thanks for making our first trip to Ireland so welcoming!"
526767,463905822,6/4/2019,"Dardos home was great for our short stay in Dublin. Fantastic location and great communication from Dardo, the street youre on is quite busy and made sleeping at night a bit challenging, but other than that very nice."
526767,464738350,6/6/2019,Location is perfect!  Just across the hapenny bridge from Temple Bar with a great view!  Dardos space is trendy and clean. A vast supply of travel books to read and the basic amenities one may need. Communication was quick and friendly. We stayed with our kids and they were comfortable on the futon sofa bed.  I highly recommend staying here for your time in Dublin!
526767,465275067,6/7/2019,"I booked the apartment because we were going to a concert. I didnt get to stay there in the end because I had to work but my brother enjoyed it. He said Dardo was nice and friendly, and the accommodation was clean and tidy, with lovely views."
526767,465823724,6/8/2019,Fantastically central location & stylish space.  Would definitely stay here again!

526767,484732259,7/9/2019,"This flat has absolutely everything you might need for a trip to Dublin. Incredible, perfect location. It is literally steps away from the Hapenny Bridge and walking distance to loads of pubs, restaurants, and attractions. Stylish and unique space with lots of room for two. The bed was comfy and windows let in lots of natural light. Dardo was a fantastic host - quick to respond, very helpful, and gave us great tips for enjoying the town like a local. If were ever in Dublin again we would absolutely stay here again."
526767,486290830,7/12/2019,Dardos place is in a PERFECT location. He communicates with renters well and met us at the place at checkin to make sure we had everything we needed. The place is very clean and within walking distance of everywhere in Dublin.
526767,489662750,7/17/2019,Dardo's place was very clean and welcoming. He was very helpful and it was a great place to stay after landing in Dublin.
526767,493997354,7/23/2019,"Dardo is a wonderful host! From the very beginning he was warm and welcoming, offering many suggestions of how to get to places and things to do. His apartment is clean, spacious, and right in the heart of the city. We could not have asked for a better experience. We will definitely try to book again when we come to Dublin I think the future!"
526767,495652158,7/26/2019,"Fantastic studio apartment with views over the haùpenny bridge and river, lots of bars,cafe restaurants and a mini mart right on doorstep, Very central - nice area, Would suit couples or a couple with younger children who dont mind the very adequate pull out sofa bed,  Very good apartment & would definitely stay again, Dardo was great to do booking with "
526767,500034503,8/1/2019,"Our family of four stayed in the unit for three nights. We loved the style of the flat and everything was very clean. Dardo was responsive and helpful with suggestions. In addition to being a nice space, the location is just phenomenal. It was fun to watch the Ha'penny bridge as it changed in character and pedestrian traffic at different times of the day. It's right outside the window. We greatly appreciated being on the far side of the River Liffey from the more hectic Temple Bar area, but having the activities there and the sights at Trinity College only a couple minutes away by foot over the bridge. Within a block or two of the flat, there are lots of places to find food (restaurants or groceries), coffee, drinks and other more specialized shops that may interest some (a gaming store, a health food market, a Hawaiian poke shop(!), all within half a block). It is a fairly busy corner, but it quiets down at night and generally we did not have any problems sleeping. Overall, a great central spot for exploring Dublin by foot. Highly recommended!"
526767,515582436,8/23/2019,Great place to be
526767,522624087,9/2/2019,"Dardo was very accommodating and responsive, and the apartment was lovely - nice and clean, had everything we needed, and is in a great location!"

526767,526760982,9/9/2019,"This place was absolutely incredible. The apartment was spacious and clean, the location was close to everything! We were able to walk to St. Patricks Cathedral, O Connell Street, Temple Bar area, Trinity College, and the Guinness Storehouse (that was the farthest, about 25min walk). HaPenny Bridge is literally right outside the window. Not necessary to rent a car if youre staying here. The bus to catch a tour to the Cliffs of Moher was within walking distance too! 

Dardo was an excellent host, he met us at the Spire on OConnell Street, helped with luggage, and made great recommendations for places to eat around the apartment! I would recommend him to anyone. It was our first Air BNB experience and it wont be the last thanks to amazing first impression."
526767,527137055,9/10/2019,Excellent place to stay! Very close walk across the bridge to temple bar and other great pubs! Beautiful view of Hapenny bridge and the water. Apartment was very clean inside and spacious! Dardo was very quick to communicate as well. Would definitely recommend!
526767,528085430,9/12/2019,"Great location. A little noisy at night but this is to be expected based on location. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing stay I suggest leaving Dublin and finding a country stay. If you want to explore Dublin with hop-on hop-off, shopping, etc then this place may be adequate."
526767,530882050,9/16/2019,"We would definitely recommend staying here, great location and Dardo was a wonderful host."
526767,531823744,9/18/2019,"Fantastic apartment in a fabulous location. Our host was wonderful and helped us not only locate the apartment but assisted with some tips for Dublin generally. 
The apartment is a little noisy at night, but that cant be helped due to the bustling location.
Otherwise, we highly recommend this apartment."

526767,543258451,10/7/2019,Dardo was excellent and very willing to respond quickly with help getting around.  The location was in the heart of Dublin.
526767,544509387,10/10/2019,"In the heart of everything when you step out of the front door, or relax in a comfortable oasis and watch all the activity on the streets below."
526767,551538348,10/20/2019,"Dardo's place was fantastic and he was even better! It was one of our best airbnb experiences yet and I highly recommend it.  If we are ever in Dublin we will be back and want to thank you,  Dardo, for your warm hospitality "

526767,568400341,11/24/2019,"Dardos loft was beyond amazing. You absolutely cant not beat this location, right in the heart of Dublin, we were able to walk everywhere with no problem. His hospitality was top notch and gave us helpful tips through our trip to help save us time and money. If we come back to Dublin (in which we will) we are hoping to stay at Dardos again! I can not recommend this place enough!!"
536320,418494543,3/2/2019,The place is amazing!
536320,421338630,3/9/2019,We stayed a day and a half and it was amazing!  The views from our room were breathtaking.  Alison was a great host and offered helpful suggestions for food or outings when asked.  We would recommend this room to anyone!
536320,425435727,3/18/2019,"Great location, all accomodation in the appartment, Alison is nice."
536320,426243061,3/20/2019,"Loved staying in Alison's place! Beautiful apartment, amazing views, and a great location for exploring Dublin. Would definitely recommend!"
536320,428560054,3/25/2019,"Alison was an amazing host with prompt communication and warm interactions. She provided many valuable tips to inform how we could spend our relatively short stay in Ireland and they were all gems (we particularly loved Howth). 

The space is also as stylish as the photos let on - by my estimation, the views are rivaled only by few. 

Will certainly look to stay here on a return trip!"
536320,429576700,3/28/2019,"Check in was super fast!! Everyone helpful. When I first arrived- thinking what is so great about the view?ù

Stunning view! Plenty of places to eat in area."

536320,435092388,4/9/2019,The view is actually very nice and a lot of fun to wake up to in the morning. There are restaurants right outside the front door and it is about a 15-20 minute walk to the busier parts of the city. Definitely a worthwhile place to stay.
536320,438331705,4/16/2019,Allisons apartment was a great place to stay. The views from the apartment are amazing!
536320,440176022,4/20/2019,"The host Alison had been so helpful and kind during my stay with her, feel like home A very nice place in a great location. Highly recommended to those who are for travel or business."
536320,442828670,4/24/2019,"Alison's place is nice, the only comment I would make its slightly far from almost all the sights and neighbourhoods in dublin, as they are mostly on the other side of the river. Also the hot water runs out."
536320,446328255,5/1/2019,Great view and very well located to explore Dublin! Alison is a friendly and helpful host. Only parking is a bit of an issue if you travel Irland by car.
536320,447270694,5/3/2019,"As all the reviews this year state, spectacular views and great location. Would just add that it's a two minute walk to the LUAS (Tram) which takes one across the City... and there must have been five coffee shops and breakfast bars to choose from during that walk!"
536320,448638474,5/5/2019,"Lovely apartment and location.
Alison wasn't at home when we stayed which wasn't an issue as we had the run of the apartment.
Brilliant views of Dublin.
Key left at concierge, no hassle at all.
Would recommend great place to stay.
Nice bar in square below which did a filling breakfast with good menu."
536320,449711318,5/7/2019,Good host - lovely accommodation
536320,453995179,5/17/2019,"Awesome view of Dublin; great location, we walked to all the places we wanted to go to; a wonderful host who spent some time with us giving us tips and who also left her space for us to enjoy alone, a perfect balance."
536320,455909672,5/20/2019,Had a great stay. Location was perfect - away from the busy streets but within walking distance to all the main sites and pubs.
536320,462830622,6/2/2019,This place is just as beautilful and convenient as described in listing. The Jameson distillery area is very close by. I would recommend the tour as well as the restaurants nearby. There is a Fresh grocery store very nearby as well as movie theater and bar/restaurant right downstairs. This is a great value for your money.
536320,469345720,6/14/2019,Alison was very responsible and respectful . The WiFi stopped working one night but she managed to fixed it up within 12 hours and I am very impressed by the response! Highly recommended to stay her place if you travel to Dublin . There is a very fun Irish pub right downstairs cross the street which I recommend too :)
536320,473278169,6/21/2019,The flat with the view over Dublin and the quater is very impressiv and unforgetable
536320,476546025,6/26/2019,A perfect spot to explore Dublin from!
536320,478119848,6/29/2019,"We enjoyed Dublin for three days and had a wonderful stay in Alison's apartment. It has excellent views, a superb sleeping room and is located in a lively neighborhood, yet quiet being at the 11th floor and with good transportation options to other parts of the city."
536320,480747524,7/3/2019,Alison's place is in a great location of Dublin. The apartment has cozy little nooks to sit and read as well as lovely views of Dublin. Alison made us feel right at home! A great place to stay while visiting.
536320,486233622,7/12/2019,Alison is a great host. This is a very relaxed space. Very informal. You are getting a great location at a very good price. Alison creates a very laid back experience. It could be tidier but that's only a small criticism for a very good value for money apartment.
536320,486644522,7/13/2019,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
536320,487830845,7/14/2019,The place is one of the very few high view points of Dublin. You can sit in the pillowed windowsill contemplating the whole city. A huge loft very nicely decorated and fully equipped. I can only recommend it!
536320,503602490,8/6/2019,"We adored the location of Alisons place. Its very close to the tram and just off from the loud parts. Her flat is clean, beautiful, and very convenient. The views, of course, are unmatched. Highly recommend!"
536320,506183665,8/10/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Alison's and especially loved the location in Smithfield! It was very convenient, with lots of handy shops and restaurants nearby and perfect walking distance to the Temple Bar area and surrounding attractions. Thanks, Alison!"
536320,512483018,8/18/2019,"Alison was a lovely host and very accommodating for our late arrival. 

The location is great with many bars, restaurants close by and walking distance to the main attractions. 

Unfortunately thats where the positives stop. Alison has long term guests staying with her that seem to have a complete disregard to other people staying there. 

They thought it was acceptable to chat loudly at 1am next door to our room and then the same early in the morning. 

The cleanliness of the property isnt great. Lots of dust/dirt on the floor making it impossible to walk bare foot. 

The bathroom was particularly dirty with dust and hairs. I also hurt myself on the tap on the sink as there was no handle. 

The views from the bedroom are fantastic however the light shines through every early. 

The worst thing about the apartment was the stench. No idea where it came from but it wasnt pleasant at all."
536320,514430046,8/21/2019,"Lappartamento e in una zona carina, non troppo lontana dal centro. La camera e confortevole, bagno ok."
536320,525909189,9/8/2019,Great location. Lovely space and view. Great city
536320,528024292,9/12/2019,Alison's place is exactly what you need to spend a week/weekend in Dublin. She was very understanding and accommodating (she let me drop off my stuff well before check in since I had an early arriving flight).
536320,535471552,9/24/2019,Alison is a very kind person. The view from the room was amazing as well as being very close to the city center. Would recommend to stay there.
536320,543251433,10/7/2019,The views are great! Bed is firm and the tidiness of the home could be improved to make guests feel more at ease
536320,555104034,10/27/2019,"Het was een fijn verblijf, Alison is super vriendelijk. Op een top locatie. Alles is in de nabijheid te vinden."
536320,559509800,11/4/2019,"Great place to stay in a great location with plenty to keep you entertained right on your doorstep. Easy access to the centre, walking distance, or easy public transport links. Great tips and info from Alison on the local spots. Very accommodating host. Hopefully we will return."
536320,563307710,11/12/2019,Alisons place was amazing! Very close to everything and super accessible. I didnt spend much time in the flat but when I was there it really felt like home. Will definitely be my first choice for my next Ireland trip.
536320,568319064,11/24/2019,"The room has an amazing view of Dublin. The unique layout of the flat offers the privacy anybody would ever hope for. Alison was very helpful, cooperative, throughout the process."

Thanks again!"
547945,422017519,3/10/2019,"Highly recommended. I would have liked to stay for longer. Alwyn is very considerate and the house is cute and warm. Theres a park behind the house, and its near a supermarket and a bus."
547945,422512428,3/11/2019,"Strategic position at ten minutes walk  from the Airlink stop (fast bus from/to the airport). Two minutes more and you'll get to O'Connell Street. Genuine quiet neighborhood, comfortable bed. I arrived late and left very early in the morning, so I could enjoy the place but partially."
547945,423828615,3/15/2019,Really sweet and helpful! Wouldve stayed longer if I couldve!

547945,425900870,3/19/2019,"A pleasant throw-back to simple early-mid-20th century simplicity. Simple, yet comfortable accommodations, with a friendly and informative host. For those inclined to walk 15-20 minutes to reach the city center or use public transportation, the historic neighborhood of small row-houses near the Blessington Basin park is perfect."
547945,430352449,3/30/2019,"If you want to be fast into the town center, this place is perfect. Alwyn is a very friendly person and answered all my questions referring to Dublin's sightseeing attractions,  pubs, bus connections, etc."
547945,430836132,3/31/2019,Alwyn's house is Very great. I really enjoyed my stay There. The location is amazing and I really recommend.
547945,432551978,4/4/2019,"Im fairly new to Airbnb but by far Alwyn has been my best host. The place is in a perfect location to see a lot of downtown in walking distance.

She offered me tips on what to see and even showed me on the map. When I woke up early at 6 am to leave she even had coffee for me. Amazing!"
547945,432965291,4/5/2019,"I had a really nice time in dublin, thanks to alwyns great tipps 
The appartment was located very well 
I experienced a warm welcome with an offer of tea and even breakfast before leaving"
547945,434080856,4/7/2019,Really nice place to stay. You just have to walk for 7 minutes to get to the O'Connell street and just next to the accommodation is a beautiful park.
547945,434637231,4/8/2019,Amazing location and great value. Very flexible with check in/out if you have flights to catch. And a cute little dog was an added bonus!

Would book it again."
547945,440167635,4/20/2019,Alwyns place is very comfortable and in a great location.
547945,441897636,4/22/2019,Alwyn is such a great host with great local tips for things to do. Her cute little dog Jake was also very welcoming! The location is at the Blessington Basin which is a beautiful park. It was so nice to have lunch in the park before going to explore Dublin. This location is north of city center but can be easily reached by bus and then a short walk. Overall a great value and I would definitely stay here with Alwyn again when visiting Dublin!
547945,442441567,4/23/2019,"Alwyns flat is right next to a delightful park, in a central enough part of town to walk to most places pretty easily and quiet enough to keep your windows open at night. Alwyn is very clear and hospitable, she even made me breakfast!"
547945,443134197,4/25/2019,"Alwyn was a great host. She was quick to reply to all the messages I sent her and carefully explained everything I needed to know once I arrived. She also helped me find the Airport Express Bus information that I needed. Her home is in a lovely residential part of town but only about a fifteen-minute walk to the center. 
She made me coffee before I left and offered me Irish bread and butter."
547945,445501758,4/29/2019,"Alwyn is an excellent host very informative regarding suggestions as to what to do during your stay,nice lady and nice clean house in a nice part of Dublin very cute dog Jake. Highly recommended"

547945,448424103,5/5/2019,"Alwyn is an excellent host and I felt very comfortable and at home as soon as I walked through the door and she introduced herself. The room is lovely and I had two great nights sleep there. I couldnt recommend this place enough for a visit to Dublin. Ill definitely go back next time I come to the city. Its around a 10 minute walk to the centre of Dublin.

Getting to the address:
When you leave the airport go to the bus park. The bus park/station is broken down in to zones that are clearly marked up. Go to zone 15 and get on the number 16 or 41 bus - the buses are very frequent. I got on the number 16 bus - get off at the stop named Fredrick Street it is the stop after the junction of Fredrick Street North/Blessington Street. The bus is 3/4 Euro and you need the exact change. 

Getting to the airport:
Walk to Rotunda, Parnell Square West - which is 8 minutes from the Alwyns. Get on the number 16 bus - exact change needed again (3/4 Euro). The bus goes to T1 and T2 at the airport and takes around 30/40 minutes."
547945,450092330,5/8/2019,"Alwyn is a wonderful host and her place is in the perfect location if you are looking to explore downtown Dublin by foot. A short walk to great pubs, restaurants and sightseeing but far enough that you will be able to get a quiet nights sleep. Alwyn and her pup were so welcoming and the breakfast was delicious! Highly recommend for solo travelers looking to explore the area!!"
547945,451161480,5/11/2019,"Alwyn's place is fab - it's perfect for the single traveller. Located quite close to the city centre, with bus and Luas literally a couple of blocks away - it's quite easy to access. Alwyn is a lovely host - very welcoming with a calm easy manner - I was in my room, knowing where everything was in the house and how to use it within minutes of my arrival. The room itself is great - plenty of space and huge light from 2 big windows. The single bed had proper linen sheets, excellent pillows and a wonderful cozy duvet. Although the house itself is fairly small, my room was perfectly private and quiet. Jake, her wonderful terrier, is a complete joy. Over breakfast, Alwyn and I discovered we had friends in common - I left feeling like we'd known each other for years - thank you Alwyn, I'll def be back!"
547945,452960099,5/14/2019,"My only regret is not staying here longer! Alwyn made my first trip to Ireland a pleasant one. Her home is in a quiet neighborhood that is about a 10-15min walk to O'Connell Street (or you can take the bus that goes halfway). Very nice person, who made me breakfast every morning and was lovely to talk to. I can definitely recommend her!"
547945,455860972,5/20/2019,Super gelegen.  Alwyn ist sehr hilfsbereit und gibt gute Tips.

about what to do in Dublin.
Christer"
547945,469728937,6/15/2019,"Very central location, clean and tidy room, very hospitable host - you really can't ask for anything more. Did I mention Alwyn cooks you breakfast as well?

Certainly one of the best experiences I've had on the site."
547945,471413481,6/17/2019,"Very nice lady, bed was great and the location is very near o Connell street. Enjoyed the experience."
547945,472345050,6/19/2019,"Alwyns home was perfectly located right near the city center. I enjoyed my stay so much and wished I could have been there longer. Her room was clean, comfortable, and her breakfast in the morning is lovely and such a perk. She was quick to recommend something for me to do when I said I wanted to see the coast. Would highly recommend a day in Howth and the hike along the coastline! Alwyn was kind and her dog Jake is the sweetest!"
547945,475485528,6/24/2019,A nice stay.
547945,475976680,6/25/2019,"Alwyn was a fantastic host that made sure at all times that I felt comfortable.

547945,476538942,6/26/2019,Alwyn is a great host and very kind. I felt very comfortable in the space and I would stay here again.
547945,477022801,6/27/2019,Alwyn's room was clean and cozy. Alwyn is a lovely lady and it was a pleasure to be hosted by her. She even made breakfast for me in the morning. The area is nice and quiet and the bus stop was about 5 minutes away on foot. There is a beautiful pond with swans and ducks right by her house where you can enjoy the view. Food places and pubs are a couple minutes away. Would definitely stay here again.
547945,479692179,7/1/2019,"Thanks to Ms. Alwyn,Ireland becomes my favorite country."
547945,481206152,7/4/2019,"Excellent location and great hospitality, would absolutely stay there again."

547945,486204023,7/12/2019,"Alwyn has a welcoming presence the moment you step into her home. Both Alwyn and Jake, her lovely Jack Russel terrier, give great company and reassurance, and truly are great, superhosts! Alwyn's home reminded me of a cottage on the beach. It gave a very down-to-Earth feel and made you feel at home. The bedroom is spacious and having a one of the windows open gives a nice breeze. The bathroom is on the other side of her home, so be sure to bring a torch so you can find your way during the night. Her home is very centralised in the Dublin City Centre. You can get just about anywhere by foot which is really nice. For every where else, purchase a Leap card for ‚Ç¨5.00, you can continuously top-up the card with more Euros as you need. There are no public toilets in Dublin, so do keep that in mind when you are planning your day trips into the city. If taking a ferry, plan to take a local cab to Irish Ferries and book your ticket over the phone if you are able. There are so many lovely parks close by, like St. Steven's Green and Trinity College. If you enjoy rock climbing, there are several places in town to explore. I set out on the Gravity Climbing Centre and it was excellent. Great staff and lovely company. If you love to read or just want to experience an eccentric bookstore and secondhand book exchange, then (Website hidden by Airbnb) is your place. I would almost go back to Dublin to re-experience it all over again. Overall, my experience in Dublin was wonderful. And I know that I will be back there in the future, and most likely with my mum. Thank you for being such great company, Alwyn and Jake, and for making Dublin a wonderful home away from home."
547945,486994852,7/13/2019,"Alwyn is an outstanding hostess with a lovely home. She offered me tea as I arrived, gave me all the information I needed about transportation and things to do in the city, and even made breakfast in the morning! Her home is clean and comfortable. I highly recommend Alwyn to anyone considering a stay in Dublin."
547945,488609747,7/15/2019,"Alwyn gave me wonderful hints for sightseeing/Irish folk music/dining. Her house is wonderfully placed in a calm and pretty area, so close to the center that I had everything in a walking distance. I enjoyed my stay with her (and her sweet little terrier) immensely."

547945,489804278,7/17/2019,"Alwyn's place was a great place to stay in Dublin! I had stayed a longer time in Dublin at a different Airbnb and only stayed at Alwyn's place one night after traveling in other parts of the country and before flying out the next day. It's pretty well located -- right next to a nice park and maybe a 15-minute walk from the main downtown area of O'Connell Street. There are also plenty of restaurants nearby if you don't want to venture as far. I didn't spend a whole lot of time in the house itself, but Alwyn was very responsive to messages and was nice enough to let me drop off my bags earlier than the stated check-in time. The room was comfortable and the bathroom is a shared one, located downstairs off of the kitchen. This is Alwyn's house, so you should not expect hotel-like accommodations, but it was a comfortable stay and a great base for exploring the city. There's also a lot of wonderful artwork around, much of it done by Alwyn herself. Her dog, Jack, was also very cute and friendly. Alwyn gave me some good recommendations for places to go in the city and cooked a light breakfast in the morning (a softboiled egg and toast with butter or jam). It was a short trip, but I'd definitely stay there again if I'm ever visiting Dublin!"
547945,494488089,7/24/2019,"Terrific spot to stay in Dublin but not smack in the middle of the city. Loved the ability to walk one way and find some quant sights and spots to eat, or the other to hit the city Centre."

The place was clean and I was given enough privacy. It is about 15-20 mins walk to the main sights but a bus can be taken instead. I loved how the Basin was just outside! Really nice. I stayed during the colder months but the place was nice and warm and Alwyn even had an electric blanket on the bed.

Tom and James were very helpful throughout our stay,  we could not have asked for better hosts!"
587218,425438713,3/18/2019,Immer wieder gerne
587218,434727720,4/8/2019,"James and Tom are very kind-hearted people. Their hospitality was so great that we felt so very welcome the minute we walked through the door to this beautiful house. 15 minutes walk to the center. You can park the car in the street in front of the house. The tips Tom and James gave us made our trip to Dublin just perfect. We highly recommend this location if you want to have a great ""home"" for your vacation in Dublin. We definitely would come back!"
587218,452957624,5/14/2019,"Tom and James were a delight! Incredibly charming and fun to chat with, not to mention the amazing space. They went above and beyond in giving us a ride to pick up our car at the impound after it had been towed, and gracious about it to boot. The location is ideal, the room lovely, literally the best bathroom in all of Irelandîand the showerîwow! Im going to try to figure out how to get that water pressure!

Highly recommend. Will definitely look them up next time Im in Dublin."
587218,454378765,5/18/2019,"Tom and James are the loveliest hosts we've had the pleasure of staying with. They're home is as warm and cozy as they are.

We would DEFINITELY recommend others stay here. Thank you, James and Tom!"
587218,461260999,5/31/2019,"James and Tom are hosts in the original spirit of AirBnB. They made us feel welcome to their beautiful home, gave us good tips to the area, and we enjoyed talking with them."

All parts of their home, including the shared living spaces were meticulous. James and Tom went out of their way to make us feel at home-they provided a light breakfast as well as great traveling tips. 
We would highly recommend a stay in their home and hope to be back. Thank you James and Tom!"

587218,487845869,7/14/2019,"Our time with Tom and James (and Misty, their cat) was a unique one. Aside from friends and family, this is the first time weve experienced a host offering to eat breakfast with his guests. So its a great time to get to know someone who lives there. The place is in a quiet neighbourhood where you can feel at home in. Their backyard has a little garden that feels like a world of its own. So you can take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. But getting to the city centre is literally a short bus ride away, and its also located within walking distance of a LUAS stop. Even though our stay in Dublin was only a few days, it was rich enough that it makes us want to return to get more out of the place!"
587218,520302051,8/30/2019,"James and Toms home was very comfortable, clean and welcoming. It is located a short bus ride from OConnell Street and there are eating places near by.

James and Tom are very hospitable as well as great people to chat with over a beautiful breakfast that they  served. The accommodations were clean and the bed and linens so very nice. Great location, a 20 minute walk into downtown OConnell street and all that Dublin has to offer.  Would definitely return to stay here again."
587218,530048225,9/15/2019,"We stayed in September 2019. James was not there but we met Tom! It was not just a stay at their place as Tom welcomed us very friendly and took time to chat with us, gave us tips for dublin and was just so kind to us. The place was very clean and looked like the photos. The breakfast was really nice! The city centre is not far away so you can walk or take the bus.

We had really good and interesting conversations with Tom. He made our first Irland Trip very special. Thank you for that!

If you want to have more than just a place to stay you should go to James and Tom. We would definitly stay with them again!

Cindy and Jonas"

587218,562836162,11/11/2019,"James&Toms house is located in a quiet neighbourhood that is in a walkable distance from city center (30 min). There are nice restaurants, pubs, shops in a 5 min radius and bus&tram stops nearby. 
We spend almost a week at James&Toms place and we felt like being accommodated by distant family. They were helpful, welcoming and chatting to them about the world couldn¬¥t be easier. The house itself is lovingly decorated, has nice and spacious rooms and the breakfast was tasty. It was one of our best stays with airbnb and we would recommend James&Tom to anyone."
592840,443162984,4/25/2019,"Second stay in a week! That says it all. Siobhans hospitality, great location, and comfortable bed make this an easy choice."
592840,465123086,6/7/2019,A lovely house with great hosts. Really appreciated the beautiful breakfast. Thanks.
592840,468716760,6/13/2019,Large clean room and en-suite. In a quiet area.

610233,425524909,3/18/2019,Kate was a fantastic host. Very helpful and fast on the communication. Was happy to let us have a late check out also to accommodate the timings with our flight. Great house and great spot.

630655,429595192,3/28/2019,"Stayed at Alison place for nearly 6 weeks. Nice place, good coffe, short distance walk to everything. Good place!"
630655,435413301,4/10/2019,"The best spot to stay. Everything was so close by. Also, the best view of Dublin. It made my first time visiting Ireland so memorable."
630655,436538425,4/13/2019,"Unfortunately, my stay at Alisons place didnt start off well. When I got to the apt, which was not so easy to find, the concierge told me that there were no keys left so I couldnt get in although I was told beforehand that I can arrive at any time î and I was even late for the official time as stated in the profile. Alison was on vacation so the communication took some time. It came out that the cleaner completely forgot. After 2.5 hrs I finally had the keys. After this unfortunate start, I had a nice stay at this place. Great view from the loft, great location. Hope the key issue was only a one time thing :)"
630655,439524971,4/19/2019,"A wonderful time! Alison is very kind and will answer any questions you have. I got sick on my trip and she was very generous, telling me where the nearest clinic and pharmacy was."

649740,418943462,3/3/2019,"Walkable to just about everything! trinity university, Christchurch cathedral, Dublin castle all within a few blocks. Dave gave us some great food recommendations. the room was just what we had hoped for and a great bargain for the location."
649740,422015975,3/10/2019,"Dave is a superb host. He provides plenty of insight on the city of Dublin and ensures you won't run out of things to do. The place was in a perfect location, being in the Temple Bar area, yet just outside to be quiet. I would recommend Dave's place to anyone!"
649740,424924313,3/17/2019,"A friend and I stayed here for St. Paddy's weekend, and we had an amazing time! We rocked up with no plans and no prior knowledge on what to do in Dublin, so we followed Dave's (extensive and detailed) advice and we feel we really got the best out of it :) Top marks!"
649740,425909022,3/19/2019,Daves place is simply perfect! Right in the heart of temple bar and within walking distance of most shops and food places. Dave is probably the most helpful host I've ever had! Very knowledgeable about the surrounding area and with helping us figure out local transportation for our trip.
649740,426926328,3/22/2019,Enjoyed my time in Dublin. Dave is a great host and the apartment is in the perfect location. Would not hesitate to stay here again
649740,428583212,3/25/2019,"I took an airbnb and travel break for a while, but the stay with Dave was the best experience to get back into it. He's an incredibly good host, thinks of all the small details and knows the best spots around town.  We even got to hang out with him at the pub and had a really good time :) All you can wish for and then some - that's a stay here!"
649740,430295769,3/30/2019,Dave was a great host and ensured all lines of communication were open between guests. We enjoyed our stay and the location was great!
649740,431550955,4/1/2019,Great host! Nice place!
649740,434656115,4/8/2019,"The flat is ideally located, Dave has great tips for his hosts, everything was very smooth"
649740,435779476,4/11/2019,"The apartment is just on the edge of Temple Bar, this means it is fairly quiet but within a short walk of all the action"
649740,437199457,4/14/2019,"Great spot to stay in Dublin. The location is just perfect. 
The apartment is very nice and we had everything we could need.
Communication with Dave was very easy. 
The fact that we could leave our luggages before or after in the apartment is a great advantage for the travellers. 
The only ¬´¬†disapppointment¬†¬ª was for us about the mattress, which we did not feel really comfortable. (Too soft, but everyone has different expectations on this).
We would be definitely recommend Daves place to anyone!"
649740,438342995,4/16/2019,"Cant beat the location for this price.  Dave gave great recommendations for what to see and do, and he was super fast in responding to every question.  Thanks very much, Dave!"
649740,442715650,4/24/2019,"Dave is a great man! We got a lot of tipps were we can park, were are good pubs and so on.... The apartment is great :)"
649740,444124060,4/27/2019,The bed was a bit firm but that seems to be pretty common as I'm finding out! There was quite a bit of noise outside until 2am on Friday but it is to be expected... It's temple bar! Very quiet on Thursday. Apartment was very central and great value. We were very grateful for the fan and host left an assortment of helpful things in and around the apartment. We barely saw our flat mate and when we did he was polite and friendly. The host responded quickly to every message as we had flight delays. I'd stay here again.
649740,445448535,4/29/2019,"Dave is an amazing host! He wasnt even in Dublin during my visit but stayed on top of everything and quickly responded to anything I needed from him. This is in addition to very detailed and clear instructions and tips he provided in advance!  The most organized and responsive host I have ever experienced.

Location is superb - right at the edge of Temple Bar and within walking distance to many other attractions. Airport transfer as well as HopOn/HopOff tour bus stop is literally across the street. Area is safe and very lively. 

My room and bathroom had everything I needed. I did not use the rest of the apartment but did notice that the kitchen is fully stocked. It was surprisingly cold in Dublin that weekend and I loved how my room was nice and cool for sleeping but the bathroom always stayed warm."
649740,445873160,4/30/2019,"Initially, we were very excited to stay at Daves place as he gave a long explanations of meet up, check in and things to do in the city. It seemed to be a great deal, location and host but when we got to Dublin that was not the case. We had agreed on meeting at a location not at the Airbnb and the plan was for me to message him when we arrived at the airport so we could plan the timing accordingly. Our plane was slightly late but I messaged him as discussed when we landed. I also messaged him when we got on the bus and were headed towards the meeting location. Then again when at said location. This was over a span of two hours without a response. We continued to wait another hour but he never responded. We had a snack at a cafe next door waiting for a response and still nothing. We ended up having to cancel the reservation since we had all of our luggage with us and wanted to make sure we could find a place for the night. It was very disappointing and upsetting that there was no communication so last minute causing us to lose money and a place to stay."
649740,447274198,5/3/2019,Great place to stay! All important things in reachable distance.
649740,449344541,5/6/2019,"I would highly recommend Dave's flat. The flat has everything u need, and its location is super close to the Temple Bar, which made our trip really easy!!"
649740,451142064,5/11/2019,Had a very good stay at Dave's place. Everything is very well organized. He is taking a lot of care that every guest is perfectly informed about all necessary details
649740,452885301,5/14/2019,Dave and his colleague are nice people. The place is in a fantastic position and the house is good enough.
649740,453662196,5/16/2019,What an amazing experience! Dave's place is right in the heart of Dublin. It is primarily located near all the major attractions such as Christ church and Dublin castle. The room was clean and tidy. He made sure you have everything at your comfort and more.... I definitely recommend Dave's place to anyone on a long or short visit to Dublin.
649740,457093908,5/23/2019,"After an initial contact problem shortly before the trip, contact and meeting point were slightly changed. Then everything worked out perfectly. The location of the apartment is great! Thanks Dave!"
649740,458751936,5/26/2019,"Amazing space right at the end of temple bar. Easy to find, close to several places in walking distance. Really loved it."
649740,460423993,5/29/2019,"Perfect place for Dublin! A bit expensive, but it's Dublin! The apartment is close to Temple Bar but in a quiet place. The room is large enough and all the apartment is clean. Best communication ever!
Thanks for the cookie jar ;)"
649740,461251146,5/31/2019,The location of Dave's accommodation is absolute magic. You are in the middle of all the action and can catch local transport to anywhere you need to go. Just off the main street at the back of the building so very little noise. Bed smaller than normal double at 130cm wide. Washer and dryer worked very well. TV great. security first prize - after coming from South Africa?? Cosy and very livable space.
649740,463356642,6/3/2019,Amazing location and nice place.
649740,464362054,6/5/2019,"Although weve stayed with Airbnb hosts many times, weve never encountered a host as thorough and professional yet personable as Dave."
649740,465708675,6/8/2019,Daves place was comfortable and centrally located.  There was some construction noise and people being loud but thats to be expected considering how close to the downtown we were.  The map he distributes is very helpful.  He went above and beyond to help transport a camera that didnt get unloaded at the airport in Colorado.  Thanks Dave!
649740,467438791,6/10/2019,"Zeker een aanrader. Perfectie locatie en duidelijke uitleg over Dublin. Passie voert de (Website hidden by Airbnb) de hoek leuke wijnbar,Piglet."
649740,472306300,6/19/2019,"Dave's place is perfect for a quick trip to Dublin. As a solo female traveler, I felt completely safe staying there. Dave was great at communicating quickly (even when I asked for the name of a fish and chips shop at 9pm), his check-in was great, and he had a lot of nice touches like tons of recommendations, cookies, filtered water, and hair dryer. The place was a bit small, but tidy and neat, and in a super central location (I never had to order a taxi/Uber the entire time I was there) - in short, a great value for the cost.  You can hear a lot of noise from the street, but that's because it's in the Temple Bar (touristy drinking) area. Even so, it's on the slower/quieter side of Temple Bar, and with some ear plugs, I didn't have any issues. Thanks for a great stay!"
649740,473204660,6/21/2019,"Dave is an excellent host, really friendly, helpful and communication was easy. The room was great, very clean, comfortable and Dave even left some cookies which was a really nice touch! The bathroom which I had to myself was extremely clean and had plenty of hot water for a nice shower. The location is perfect if you want to be directly in the middle of Dublin, everything is within a short walking distance. Overall I would highly recommend Daves place."
649740,474682050,6/23/2019,Dave takes joy in providing just the right touches for those traveling to Dublin. He makes you feel welcome in his home and adds thoughtful touches throughout. A delightful place to stay in the perfect location to Temple Bar.
649740,476550893,6/26/2019,"I would highly recommend Dave's place! Dave is a wonderful host--he sent me an extensive e-mail ahead of time full of travel instructions, places to eat, things to do, etc. Upon arrival he accommodated an early check in for us. He gave us a tour of the immediate area and went over a map of with us, giving us a lot of insight into the area. Many of our favorite places we went/ate were recommended to us by Dave! The location is also superb--anything of interest in Dublin is within walking distance."
649740,477931093,6/29/2019,"My husband and I stayed at Daves place for a couple nights while staying in Dublin, and we are happy we did! It was easy to get to his place from the airport, and many thanks to Dave because he gave such helpful tips from the beginning. When we arrived in Dublin, he was in constant communication with us, met us at the bus stop, showed us how to get into the place and gave us advice on places to see and places that locals really like to go to. He was also available as little or as much as we needed during our stay. We greatly enjoyed the accommodation and it was a great location! I highly recommend."

649740,481250006,7/4/2019,Our stay with Dave was great. The apartment couldnt be in a better location. You can get to nearly every part of the city within 20 minutes. Dave gave us some awesome tips about getting around Dublin and gave us so many spots to check out. He even went out of his way to let us borrow a tripod when we said we wanted to take some photos on the river. Great stay overall!

649740,486316601,7/12/2019,"Dave was great! He collected us and walked with us to his apartment where he took the time to familiarize us with Dublin and some of his favorite spots to tour and eat.

Little touches like tea and cookies were so thoughtful and we loved checking out his recommendations for food and drinks. 
If you can book this very central location for your time in Dublin, do it! You will not be disappointed. Make sure you check out the Boxty House and the Queen of Tarts while you're there!"

649740,497316136,7/28/2019,"Daves place what exactly what we needed, exactly where we needed it. His communication was great, especially the day of our arrival. He was very thorough with his explanations and made us feel at home. He also went out of his way to make sure we found the correct route home, as construction has rerouted all of the local buses. We are happy to stay with Dave again if we ever find ourselves back in Dublin."
649740,498684111,7/30/2019,"Daves place is literally 3 mins walk to all the live music bars etc on temple bar. The accommodation is exactly what you see in the pics with nice little extra touches like tea, coffee & biscuits in your room and even has shower gel/shampoo for you to use in the bathroom . You can use the lounge area however we never bothered as just needed a base and a place to sleep. Dave was a great host , thanks Dave."
649740,504211566,8/7/2019,Dave did a great job greeting us. He gave us as much space as we wanted but was willing to converse about his community. We had a great trip and the location is close to everything. Get your Irish breakfast at the queen of tarts. Its a minutes walk and they even have yummy gluten free options.
649740,505492024,8/9/2019,"Dave was an all-around excellent host. As soon as we arrived in Dublin, Dave was very responsive and helped us navigate the local bus system to easily find his place. After that, Dave went over a comprehensive map of Dublin with us and provided suggestions of things to do. During our stay, Dave remained responsive while still making us feel like we had the whole apartment to ourselves. Overall, we had a great experience in Dublin and Dave played a large part in that. Thanks Dave!"

649740,520862379,8/31/2019,Dave is a wonderful host and knows his way around Dublin. His place is in the perfect location and is close to many restaurants and bars. Dave also has his own map of Dublin that was very useful and had all the best local spots on it. He took the time to show us around and even picked us up from the bus stop. Daves apartment was very clean and had everything we needed.
649740,528520702,9/13/2019,"Daves place is very comfortable and in a great location, accessible to everything.  Both Dave and Dwaine, who was filling in for Dave while I was visiting, were very friendly and helpful, responding to every query completely and very quickly. I would happily stay in Daves apartment if Im ever visiting Dublin again."
649740,531811744,9/18/2019,Im very disappointed in this Airbnb. We went without water for over half of a day and the person assisting us didnt respond for 8 hours.  I wouldnt stay here again unless the host actually stayed in town for the next stay.
649740,532741195,9/20/2019,"Weve had a great stay at Daves apartment. It is well situated,  downtown, with good attractions in the neighbourhood, nice and clean. We were impressed with all the communication (complete guide) that Dave sent to us. We would definitely come back here"

649740,536807521,9/27/2019,"What a fun little place this is and a fantastic location. We were able to walk where ever we wanted to go, and even walked our way just about 2 miles to Kilmainham Gaol, which I highly recommend by the way. We picked up a few odds and ends at the Centra in order to make our own breakfast and have some snacks on hand seeing as there is full access to the kitchen. An extra little perk was that we found out the Pixies were in town our last night there and managed to score tickets (to the sold out show!) and the venue was literally about 2 blocks from the apartment!"
649740,537824642,9/29/2019,We had an excellent stay at this spot in Dublin! Great location for airport transport and very close to Temple Bar and Trinity college. We were greeted by Dwaine and had all around great interactions with him and Dave throughout our stay. Would recommend
649740,544109353,10/9/2019,"I stayed at Dave's apartment for 5 nights and it was an amazing first AirBNB experience. Dave and Dwaine were great and kind hosts. If you are going to spend time in Dublin and want to stay in a good location, Dave's apartment is a great choice!"

The location was second to none, situated close to any restaurants, pubs, shopping, and attractions you could wish to see. His place was clean and check-in/out was a breeze. I did not meet Dave, but his co-host Ivana was prompt and helpful when checking in. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting."
649740,556701381,10/30/2019,"This was perfect for the location to the city centre! Dave and his crew were fabulous at the communications, meeting up, and answering any questions.

654589,427325017,3/23/2019,"The apartment is in a fantastic location, and was well appointed, clean, and a really nice space. Garrett was extremely accommodating and went out of his way to greet us, despite a 5 hour delay with our flights to Dublin. We had a great time."
654589,428951968,3/26/2019,"Garret's apartment is as fantastic as it looks -- the location is ideal, being so central and easy to get to (the bus to/from the airport stops practically right in front of it). The building is very secure, and the apartment itself is beautiful -- fully equipped with everything you need. (There were even extra plug adapters in the kitchen cupboards for our electronic devices, which came in quite handy, as we were travelling from Canada!)  We arrived early, well before the official check-in, but Garrett made arrangements for us to drop off our bags and get the keys anyway. And a nice bonus is the Queen of Tarts cafe, right beside the building -- delicious breakfasts and pastries.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Garrett's place to anyone visiting Dublin -- it's a great value!"

654589,435404051,4/10/2019,"A perfect place to stay in the Temple Bar area, easy access to any location."
654589,436052376,4/12/2019,Great location in Dublin.  Host a little slow in responding and host made a bizarre request for me to post a picture if my passport on to my Airbnb profile.
654589,441666778,4/22/2019,"This apartment is perfect for a Dublin City break. It is perfectly situated within city (only a few minutes walk from temple bar), spotlessly clean, and full of amenities. Would highly recommended to anyone."

654589,448615781,5/5/2019,"Perfectly located in the centre of Dublin.  Garrett's instructions were very helpful including how best to get from the airport and the length of time it would take.

Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
654589,452466724,5/13/2019,"Garrett did a great job communicating the check-in process. Apartment is very well-located if youre going to be out and about in the Temple Bar area. Everything was clean, beds were comfortable. Nice place."

654589,458555549,5/26/2019,"The last stop on my family's Ireland vacation. We spent two nights at Garrett's place, which as described is about the best location in Dublin for seeing the major attractions. In a day and a half, by walking a couple of loops we pretty much managed to see (and have time to enjoy) all of the biggest draws. The apartment is very secure and the beds and space are comfortable. Garrett is a great host and an amazing communicator providing excellent tips."
654589,460073958,5/28/2019,"Garretts place is in a perfect location for exploring Dublin. Major sites are close by, great restaurants and pubs and an easy walk to supermarkets for any supplies. The flat was a great size for our family of four and the lift was a bonus for moving luggage."
654589,462701222,6/2/2019,"We loved the amazing location in the heart of  Dublin. Everything we needed was in the apartment.

654589,484115487,7/8/2019,"A great spot right in the heart of Dublin.  Clean, comfy beds. As would be expected from the awesome location, there is some street noise, especially on weekends - so may not be best for light sleepers.  Host was easy to communicate with. I would stay here again."

654589,489707922,7/17/2019,Charming immaculate two bedroom with a nice little kitchen and bathroom.  The location is outstanding with all the best nightlife close by.  There is a fair amount of street noise in the bedroom with two beds... but a fan helps create white noise.
654589,493243223,7/22/2019,Great place. Great location.
654589,501210051,8/3/2019,Very central location! Garrett was very responsive to e-mails.  Apartment was clean but could use a refresh in terms of conditioning.
654589,504208911,8/7/2019,"This apartment worked beautifully for us for our days in Dublin. The location was perfect for our plans - we walked most places easily and found everything we needed for meals and shopping within a few blocks.  Our family of 5 was comfortable in the space , and we were not bothered by street noise. A great place to stay if you are visiting Dublin !"
654589,507259214,8/11/2019,"Perfect location, would recommend for a short stay in Dublin"
654589,512503611,8/18/2019,"We had a great time in Dublin at Garretts Apartment. Our flight had a delay, so we Camera little late for our Check Inn. Garrett waited for us and explained everything. Thank you for your patience.
The location of the Apartment is just perfect. We explored Dublin by feet and had absolutely no problems with long walks etc. 
The Apartment has everything you need. Lots of towels, well equipped kitchen and good WiFi.
We enjoyed every single day and would love to come back one day."
654589,525886312,9/8/2019,"Nice compact flat right in the heart of Dublin's Temple Bar and practically within walking distance of the City's many attractions, historical sights and shopping."
654589,532297922,9/19/2019,Garrett's description was accurate.  The location was great but a bit noisy but tolerable at times as he had indicated
654589,536671697,9/27/2019,"Garretts place was perfectly located for our stay in Dublin. It is in Temple Bar on a rather busy street so it was a little noisy, but nothing we didnt expect. The furnishings were a little tired, but the place was very clean and had modern appliances. Garrett was very helpful and responsive to all communications."
654589,537186153,9/28/2019,"A very funky apartment in an amazing location. Its full of lovely little details and has everything you need. We had a really comfortable and enjoyable stay. Garrett was a fantastic host, very accommodating and helpful. Highly recommended!"
654589,539953814,10/2/2019,"The apartment was great! Easy check-in. Clean. Stylish. Accommodating. Had a wonderful time, and is one of the best options for your money as for AirBnbs in Dublin."
654589,540912000,10/4/2019,Apartment is in a great location. We loved walking out the door and into the city. Lots of great places to eat and sites to visit within walking distance. There is a washer and dryer in the apartment and other thoughtful touches. It is older and smaller but worth it for the location. The beds are comfortable and the street noises were not bad. There are fans in both rooms that can be used to drown out the noise.
654589,543244074,10/7/2019,Fantastic location and very responsive host. Definitely recommend.
654589,545468666,10/12/2019,"My husband, sister and I stayed here for 2 nights and honestly we could not have asked for a better location in the city! Garretts place was so convenient and easy to find, a great central point to everything we wanted to be near.

The place was ideal for 3 people, 4 might be the max capacity without feeling too cramped (but honestly when youre in Dublin you never spend much time in your room anyways!) Garrett and his wife were excellent hosts, always willing to help and they were very quick to respond to our messages. 

We hope to come and stay with them again in the near future. Highly recommend you book their place!"
654589,551566376,10/20/2019,"Garretts space is accurate to the photos and has so much history. The large sash windows allowed for views and so much light. The location is perfect and security in the building was above expectations.  Garrett was quick to respond to any questions we had and we loved the coffee machine and all the little extras he so generously provided. 
Thank you for a wonderful stay in Dublin. 
Kathy Jocelyn and Erica"
654589,557201293,10/31/2019,"Garrett is definitely a superhost! He was very communicative and gave detailed check-in instructions. If you are a history-buff, you MUST stay here!!! (Ask Garrett for his write-up on the history of the building & apartment.) The view from the apartment of city hall and other period buildings were what sold me on this place (and it is definitely worth it!), but it wasn't until after booking that I learned its absolutely amazing history. (If you are a fan of Dublin writers, paranormal fiction, and Irish history, this place is for you!) 

The apartment was clean & stylish yet relaxing after a long day of touring. (The building elevator was particularly appreciated after doing so.) I wanted a place that was walkable to most of the tourist spots yet not in the middle of the craziness of Temple Bar; and its location in the heart of historic Dublin made this extremely easy. And while we did walk to other areas to shop and sight-see, there was so much in the direct vicinity that it was unnecessary to travel far. And although the apartment kitchen was fully-stocked with the essentials, cooking isn't necessary with all the delicious places to eat close-by. I particularly recommend the downstairs bakery, Italian restaurant, and the 100-year old fish & chips shop 3-mins. away on Werburgh St! 

And when it was time to check-out, the taxi stand right across the street made getting to airport in the pre-dawn hours quite simple. [Side notes: While there is an elevator in the building, due to the historic nature of the apartment, the floors are uneven with small steps between rooms, and there is very little area on either side of the toilet. So the place would not be particularly accessible for those with mobility issues.]"
654589,558065576,11/2/2019,"Great location...walkable to all the hot spots....Trinity, Guinness, GPO, Temple Bar..."
654589,562718364,11/11/2019,Great place and location! Garrett was very helpful and accommodating.
681875,471901821,6/18/2019,"Second time in row in the same place, I guess you do not need more. Fantastic place, very well maintained, perfect location and a great host."
681875,474506432,6/23/2019,"Maria's home was very nice, clean and cozy. Maria has been very kind. The bedroom was large and comfortable.  Good and quite position. We recommend Maria's home in Dublin!"
681875,493231102,7/22/2019,It's a lovely apartment (or room in this apartment) which is nice decorated and has everything you could need. The location is really great and it has a perfect public transportation connection if needed. The bed is comfortable and there had been a lot of storage space in relation to the room size. I would recommend that apartment to anyone.
681875,515625162,8/23/2019,Great location with good nearby eats and a near many bus stops to and from.
681875,519347973,8/28/2019,This place is in a great location and easy to get to as well. Communication with Barbara was great and she checked-in with me during my stay and made some great recommendations. About 15-20 minute walk to the city center.

690119,436535109,4/13/2019,Sarah is a great host. She knows the value of details. She was always ready to help us and at the day we arrived she left us some food. My kids were hungry and tired and this detail made the difference for us.  Thank you!
690119,440165504,4/20/2019,Beautiful place outside of Dublin with easy access to the city on the light rail.   Wonderful host!
690119,444158686,4/27/2019,"Great location & an amazing place! Close to the Luas & grocery store.  Sarah was also a fantastic host, who answered our questions promptly! No need to hesitate about renting this property, it will not disappoint, it truly is a gem!"

690119,451750265,5/12/2019,Gorgeous house in a fantastic location. Sarah was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions. Stayed here with my husband and parents - everyone was very comfortable and happy with the stay
690119,455829945,5/20/2019,This house is a cute escape from reality with the gorgeous amount of natural light and amenities. Sarah is an amazing host who makes herself available whenever needed and provides an amazing tips & tricks booklet that quickly became our bible for finding restaurants/fun things to do. The Luas (tram) is a 2 min walk from the cottage and will easily get you anywhere you desire inside and outside of Dublin at a low cost. Highly recommend taking advantage of this hidden gem!
690119,459441809,5/27/2019,"Sarah was a great host. She helped out with the check-in and give us some transport trips when the light rail was temporary disrupted.

The place is exactly as shown on the pictures, showing a great comfortable and cosi place with design touches at every corner! Definitely a place to repeat. 

Kind regards,
Javier."
690119,461827910,6/1/2019,"Fabulous home with everything you would need. Sarahs attention to detail is fantastic and we really appreciated all the little touches and information provided.  

The location is terrific, with easy access to the large Dundrum Shopping Centre as well as public transport. We tried several of the restaurants recommended by Sarah and they were great."
690119,463360101,6/3/2019,Absolutely adorable and very close to everything!  A nice mall with lots of shops and restaurants close by. I would definitely come back if in the area again!

690119,473329310,6/21/2019,"Sarah is a great host.
However the place is very far away from Dublin central. Its actually in a satellite town Dundrum in the outer suburbs of Dublin being at least 30mins away by car. The trains Luas give accessibility but take time due to traffic conditions on the roads to central Dublin.
The water heating has a recurring issue.
The interiors of the house itself is tastefully done and is a pleasure to live in."
690119,474408634,6/23/2019,"An excellent accommodation in very nice location, easy and quick transport to city center using LUAS, a huge shopping centre walking distance. I would recommend to all."
690119,478119345,6/29/2019,Beautiful space and gracious host! Sarah was quick with her communication and just as quick with her kindness. She was so accommodating throughout our stay and helped us through an unexpected flight delay.

The location is great, so close to the Luas and Dundrums city center. Sarah is very helpful and thoughtful. Having been to Dublin several times, I was so thrilled to have had a new & unique experience."
690119,498761384,7/30/2019,"We are repeat visitors to Sarahs beautiful home. I honestly dont have any suggestions to improve #3. It is exactly and consistently as shown, spotlessly clean, bright, peaceful and the location is perfect. Easy access to transport, to a super Fast coach service to the airport if needed. DTC shops restaurants minutes away by foot. Lidl! Dealz! Im only Worried that the next time we want to stay it will be booked out. Thank you Sarah."
690119,510056082,8/15/2019,"Great space, awesome host, brilliant location with local / city access. Hugh shopping complex & local shops in walking distance. Great eateries to choose - we loved the Drundrum House Pub!
Highly recommended place to stay - thanks Sarah!"
690119,524612429,9/6/2019,"Sarah welcomed us after a long flight and it made a big difference in making us feel comfortable in our new temporary home. Our little family of four had an incredible week at Sarah's place.  We used the LUAS nearly every day for our adventures and Sarah's place is a short 2-3 minute walk to the station.  The home was spotless, beautiful, and incredibly well-appointed.  We also used Sarah's guidebook for nearly all of our adventures in the area.  Use her thoughtful guide,  it's wonderful!! 

  Simply put, one of the best airbnb experiences we have had thus far.  Highly recommend!"
690119,552269242,10/21/2019,"We loved our stay at Sarah's cottage. It is a great location with close access to Dundrum (lots of dining options as well as shopping). It is a very near to the Luas station which is an easy mode of public transportation to get into downtown Dublin or other locations. The cottage is beautiful, well designed with so many stylish and thoughtful elements but it is also practical and comfortable. Sarah was excellent with her communication and flexibility around check-in and check-out times. Would definitely recommend staying here and we would love to go back and stay again!"
690119,557977698,11/2/2019,"Absolutely five stars from us. Sarahs flat is charming, spotless, and cozy. Sarah has been an outstanding host. I highly recommend staying here.

My husband Jack and I just arrived from America and Sarah was very welcoming and helped us get settled and started here in Dublin. She is very thoughtful and responsive. We even had a lovely surprise of treats waiting for us. Super comfy beds and very clean. 

Thanks Sarah!"
690119,563916049,11/14/2019,Great location . Very bright and cheerful space. All the amenities you need.
692956,419092666,3/3/2019,Excellent location and value for money. Cosy little private house. We loved our first trip to Dublin.
692956,421956316,3/10/2019,"After reading many of Jim's good reviews, I was entirely disappointed in my experience at his unit. Jim provided a deceptive and untrue description of the unit. Remarks that he will not enter unit unless proper notice is given; instead comes inside, unannounced to drop off ""shampoo"", contacting me after the fact. This is 100%, unacceptable and an invasion of privacy. What if I was in the shower or sleeping? Unacceptable invasion of privacy. 
Boiler is on a timer, and unit was freezing cold 24/7. Small, ancient, unsafe space heater could not be left on due to fear of fire or electrical hazard. Unbelievable that in the cold, Irish winter, Jim would not allow the inadequate heater to run sufficiently. Description stated that Jim is flexible with check-in, however,  after contacting him, he showed no flexibility whatsoever. Linens and towels were stained and did not seem sanitary. Washer & Dryer are on a remote timer, Jim tries to force the occupant to pay extra to wash clothes when the equipment is already there and available to use. WIFI coverage was borderline unusable on my mobile, with constant drops and disconnections. The only useable connection would be if I held my mobile by a window. A WIFI repeater is needed to maintain a good connection in the unit. Jim's frugality has severe repercussions on the unit's viability."
692956,425437147,3/18/2019,"Great spot for a weekend stay in Dublin during St. Patrick's weekend. We loved having a little kitchen area to cook a meal, and the bed was much more comfortable than we expected a fold out to be. The walk to the train station is less than 10 minutes, which was very convenient."
692956,429858120,3/29/2019,"The place is tucked back off the street and very private. You can come and go as you like. Its so near transport , the sea and shops close by. Its really all I needed. All the things for cooking, and nice big tv. 
I highly recommend this getaway casbah"
692956,432891750,4/5/2019,"A lovely stay; it was a pleasure to meet Jim and he was a lot of fun, many happy returns."
692956,433992076,4/7/2019,Own studio with bathroom. Nice for a short stay near Dublin (35 minutes transport to the centre)
692956,435721796,4/11/2019,Jim had everything set for us when we arrived. Private little studio outside of his place with all the amenities you could need. Met us with a smile and recommendations for fun things to do nearby. Great location and very comfortable! We had such a lovely visit. Would stay again.
692956,440756180,4/21/2019,"Clean, convenient and comfortable - it was easy to get to Dublin centre and the room was perfect for what we needed"
692956,445427069,4/29/2019,"The place is located in a very neat and green park-like neighborhood, but its like half an hour by DART from the city centre and DART doesnt work at night, so youll have to take a cab which will cost more than 20‚Ç¨ if youll need to get back at night. The place is fine, and its great that travel adaptors were available. Of cons, the floor is really cold and no house slippers were available to help manage that. The bathroom is a little cold too, Im guessing some people will find issues with taking a shower there."
692956,448430876,5/5/2019,"I'll write out a list of pros and cons for both your own discernment as well as a subtle nudge for Jim and his snazzy lil den.
We never met Jim so all our interactions have been purely virtual. Having said that, he seems like a reasonable, friendly fellow, and everything's been straightforward. He was kind enough to have laid out a crib for our arrival, as I had mentioned we have an infant, and his was one of the places listed that was baby-friendly. We stayed for two nights in early May.

PROS
ìCrib
As mentioned, the place is generally infant-friendly, without sharp objects or scratchy surfaces. Jim is kind enough to supply a crib, however I found that one of the crib walls kept collapsing/wouldn't 'snap' into place, so we ultimately couldn't use it. We did use the crib's mat for the baby, as that helped protect them from the cold of the floor.
ìPrivate, Quiet, Clean
Cozily tucked in a driveway in suburbia, it's quiet and calm. Which suited us as we have a crying baby. It was also pleasantly clean, though the bins could do with bags.
ìLidl
This is probably one of the best features of this place. Lidl is about a 12 minute walk, which gets you outside and from where you can stock up on preparing your meals for your travels. Also, the wider transport (train) link to Dublin city centre is very easy to get to, and a similarly short walk away.
ìResponsive host
I had a question about drinking water, and texted Jim at some ungodly hour. He responded to me once he got up early the next day, cheerfully. It was nice to be able to contact him and get a pretty immediate response for any queries we had.

And now, the cons...

CONS
ìFloor
The floor, as mentioned by other guests, is very cold; and you can't walk around barefoot for too long without having to put on some socks (which then causes you to slip). A rug would go far, and/or those disposable white slippers you sometimes get at fancy hotels. We stayed in early May, which is Spring.
ìWi-fi
As mentioned by others, the wifi is poor. If you're coming from the UK, 3 allow you to roam without having to buy an add-on, so we weren't too affected. But a wi-fi signal booster would be well-suited, particularly foreign travellers without mobile data.
ìCleaning fee
The cleaning fee was just over ¬£20, which I think is steep. I suspect it's a way to recuperate rent income whilst being able to list the property's rate competitively.
ìMugs
Would be nice if the place had bigger mugs!

MISC
ìWater
No kitchen taps. This isn't such a big deal. I'm only pointing this out because the description lists 'kitchen', which can make you think that those would be included. Whilst you certainly are able to cook, I was under the impression that there would be taps in the kitchenette area. The bathroom taps do deliver drinkable water, however."
692956,452905229,5/14/2019,"This fully equipped studio apartment, where I stayed for 6 days, is a fantastic place to enjoy Dublin and the surrounding area. With the Dart, a 5-minute walk from the studio, you can reach the city in 20 minutes. Within 10 minutes you are in Sandycove on the coast where you will find various shops and restaurants.
Jim and his wife provide you with all information regarding Dublin, surroundings, restaurants etc if you want. 
Many thanks for making me feel at home at your apartment."
692956,453567295,5/16/2019,Very clean and safe
692956,455883255,5/20/2019,Super :)

692956,460525025,5/29/2019,"A very nice, clean and comfortable place. Ease of checkin-checkout was incredible!
Highly recommendable!"
692956,467472178,6/10/2019,"We were at Jim's place for 10 nights, and it worked out very well. He and Virginia are quite nice and helpful. The location is excellent-- in a lovely, convenient neighborhood near the metro that goes into Dublin. The internet was spotty, so people dependent on the internet might want their own connection. As fo us, we had a great stay."
692956,468865165,6/13/2019,My husbanda and I booked Jim's place for our first 2 nights in Ireland. It was very easy to get there from the airport and we walked to the Indian restaurant up the street which was delicious. Three DART station is within walking distance and was very easy to navigate. The room itself had all the basics needed for a comfortable stay and we enjoyed being a bit outside of the city. We walked just a few minutes to the aircoach bus on our third day to get to our rental car. All in all Jim made everything super easy and was quick to respond to any questions we had about getting around.
692956,470667760,6/16/2019,My daughter really enjoyed her stay here.
692956,471883623,6/18/2019,"So this place is tiny, but if you look around, you should find everything you need.  Jim was a great resource for local events.  The neighborhood is very nice, with good restaurants and and groceries available.  It's also within walking distance to a beautiful promenade along the harbor, and perhaps best of all, the train station is only a few blocks away.  Driving around downtown Dublin is not recommended."
692956,472703646,6/20/2019,Nice cozy place in a really good neighbourhood. Good choice if you are lone traveller.

692956,503677691,8/6/2019,Great location about 20 minutes by train outside of the city center. Lovely home and host is very quick to respond to messages. The town the house is in is also great - we enjoyed several of the restaurants after site seeing in Dublin all day!
692956,514423092,8/21/2019,"What Jim presents is exactly what you get - and a little more. He was very helpful upon my arrival and getting situated. If you have questions or recommendations he has a lot of answers, (Maybe not all, but no one does!) It was exceptionally easy to get around on transport and see the many sites while I visited my conference. (Took a couple extra days!) The quietness of the area is amazing! Unless you need city sounds to sleep, you will sleep like a baby! There is a great grocery store nearby and most everything really is within a 10-minute walk from the place. (I am a fast walker!) Enjoy your stay here, I did!"
692956,517161996,8/25/2019,"Great studio apartment, I was in Dun Laoghaire for the Ironman and the location was absolutely perfect. Jim was very flexible with my check out, which was very much appreciated. Highly recommended!!"

The beds were very nice and the place is clean. The rooms are not like 5 stars hotelrooms but if you are not expecting that it is all good.

742656,428552896,3/25/2019,"Lovely apartment and Daragh was a wonderful host. Very comfortable and clean room and very clean bathroom with a good shower. Also located in one of the best areas of the city for food and drink, with only a short walk into the city centre. Couldn't recommend it more! Thanks very much Daragh"
742656,433985755,4/7/2019,"Daragh's home is a treasure of hospitality and privacy. He's willing to chat away or give you your space. Away from the noise of Temple for quality sleep yet still close enough if you wish to partake! Simple checkin/out, clean and welcoming."
742656,437894823,4/15/2019,Toller Gastgeber und super Lage!

742656,460458518,5/29/2019,"Daragh and Sara were great hosts. Daragh left very detailed instructions with pictures of how to pick up the keys and how to find the place. He arrived about 10 minutes after we did to give us a tour of the space and showed us how to use everything. He also pointed out a bunch of great sights in the city as well as places to eat. As it was our first time in Dublin this was very helpful. 
The location is amazing! We only took the bus twice in our 9 day trip as city center and sights were all close to a mile away and a quick 20 minute walk. The street itself also has a bunch of great pubs and restaurants (I highly recommend Bunsen, the chocolate shake is one of the best I've ever had) and both St Stephens Green and Iveagh Gardens are a 5 minute walk from the flat. Daragh and Sara were around if we needed anything or had questions but were also very respectful of our space and privacy.
Overall a great experience!"
742656,462419593,6/2/2019,"We had a nice stay at Daraghs place. Good Location, lots of pubs and places to eat.  Daragh gave good tips about all the things we could do in Dublin."
742656,465111945,6/7/2019,"hi, if you are looking for a bedroom in city centre, well comunicated with the diferent ways of transportation ( luas, train and bus straight to the airport ) at a very reasonable price this place actually fit for the purpose.  I recommend the place."

742656,477021341,6/27/2019,Daragh was very kind to allow us to drop our luggage off early. He has lots of fantastic suggestions and the location was great!
742656,484219558,7/8/2019,Daragh's apartment is an absolutely perfect base to explore Dublin. Daragh could not have been more accommodating and helpful whilst still ensuring we had our own space. Would 100% recommend.
742656,488724281,7/15/2019,"Daragh and his girlfriend are very nice. Although, we did not quite enjoy our stay. Our ""bed"" cannot be called a bed anymore. The mattress is so bad I cannot even describe. Haven't slept so badly in years. You literally feel every single spring. Two nights there felt like nightmare.
Also, we didn't expect to be 6 people using the same bathroom. We knew that we will have a shared bath, but it was not only Daragh using the shower/ toilet but also his girlfriend and another couple he rent a room at the same time. Being upstairs you need to be very lucky to get an empty spot, otherwise you're walking down to the toilet/ shower and back to the room several times before you can use it..."
742656,498257247,7/29/2019,Excellent location and very friendly host who provides loads of suggestions about where to go and what to do! Lively road - 'Frank's pork shop' is actually a trendy wine bar!

742656,505403924,8/9/2019,"We had a great time at Daragh's place, perfect location for walking to the city centre. Charming appartement with beautiful interior.  Keep in mind that Camden street is busy at night so it could be a bit noisy. Brilliant restaurants and breakfast places nearby, just ask Daragh for recommendations."
742656,506965481,8/11/2019,Nice stay to place in Dublin with a central location
742656,510722274,8/16/2019,This place had everything we needed and wasnt too far from the city center. We loved that it was right across the bus station. Daragh was very helpful and friendly.
742656,515817431,8/23/2019,"The place is good and well located (25 mins walking from city centre), lots of pubs in the neighborhood (one of them is a bit noisy until late night) and Daragh was super nice and gave us a lot of useful tips for our trip."
742656,521297238,8/31/2019,Daragh is a great host!!! Gave excellent recommendations for local eats/things to see ect!

742656,554437588,10/26/2019,"Great location, walkable to most sites. Daraugh was very accommodating with our super early check in  and letting us store our bags on the last day. He offered great local tips, and communicated very promptly. Only thing to note is that there are a few flight of stairs if you have larger luggage."
742656,562102697,11/10/2019,We had a very nice stay at Daragh's. His apartment is very well located and he has a lot of good adresses to go to. Thank you again Daragh!
747284,425518014,3/18/2019,I cant imagine you will find a better host than James!! It was awesome

747284,484049748,7/8/2019,"JP is as described by Airbnb a super host. He has perfected the art of hosting , offering service on a personal level , quick responses and going above and beyond in making his place homely to his guests . He left food and fresh linen and shampoos as well as a Incase you forgotù box at our disposal . As for the accommodation. It is situated in an upper class area near Dundrum centre . Ideal for travelling in and out of the city and is a very safe and friendly place . The rooms themselves scream character; you could tell this place is more of a home then a couple of beds and four walls. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back in the future . Definitely would recommend."
747284,498097854,7/29/2019,"excellent hospitality. JP couldn't have been more welcoming and provided lots of communication in days and weeks running up to our stay. The apartment is fantastic, really clean, homely and great size for our family and Goatstown is a really great location with easy access to both city centre and the m50."
747284,508770708,8/13/2019,"Very nice place convenient to transportation, well stocked with supplies"

747284,540417139,10/3/2019,"The apartment is as advertised, clean and very comfortable.  JP met us and led us through the whole place. Its a lovely part of the city, safe and with good restaurants nearby."
747284,555171855,10/27/2019,"JPs apartment was perfect for us looking a relaxed stay in Dublin before running the marathon the next day. The thoughtful touches with the wee welcome sign, full use of the whole place, it was absolutely brilliant!! Thank you so much for letting us stay at your apartment. It was perfect for the weekend! Will definitely stay again next time we are down in Dublin."
747284,558928394,11/3/2019,"Great accommodation, good hospitality. Such a nice atmosphere!"
747976,425450523,3/18/2019,"Great host, couldn't be nicer, and very helpful. Always looking out for things to make your stay better. And you can't beat the price. Check out his record collection too."
747976,456374490,5/21/2019,Great stay . Everything went well . I can recommend a stay :)
747976,459988926,5/28/2019,Had a great time at James place! Its only a 20 min bus ride from the city center and he was a great host!
747976,463358890,6/3/2019,"Staying at James was a good experience. James helped with questions we had (providing us a leap card for the bus, adapter for our mobile phone, ordering a taxi). The apartment is 15 min walking to the bus station and 20-25 min to the city centre by bus. You have a room and your own bathroom + you can live food in a fridge or cook something in a joint kitchen. Maybe we expected a little bit better conditions but Dublin is expensive so maybe we demand too much for the price we paid."
747976,468016305,6/11/2019,"James's place is exactly as described. Even if you are staying in the same house with the host, you have your privacy. James is very kind, he gave us local tips and recommended places to go.
You can get to the city center by bus in about 20 minutes and the area is nice and quiet.
Would definitely recommend this place."
747976,471820729,6/18/2019,"James house is 10 min walking from the bus to the center or the airport.
It's a quiet neighborhood with parks and nice houses.
James explained to me the buses and also nice places."
747976,483118342,7/7/2019,"Good location for the airport, best if you're driving because bus line is a bit of a hike"
747976,494397170,7/24/2019,"Excellent! James is a great host. Friendly and always giving great tips of things you can do in and around the city. His house is comfortable, in a quiet neighborhood  and the perfect place where you can relax after a busy tourist day in the city."
747976,498210699,7/29/2019,His room is very cozy and clean and James is a very gentle man in my mind.
747976,508674863,8/13/2019,"James is a very caring and helpful host. He knows the city very well and will give you great tips about things to do and see.
The place is very quiet, the bed comfy. After a 10 min walk the bus gets you to the city centre in aprox 20 min. 
I enjoyed my stay at James and will definitely stay here again."
747976,514547174,8/21/2019,"James is very kind and helpful.
He proposed several times to bring us to the bus station and gave us some good pubs location."
747976,527645499,9/11/2019,James is so nice~ I highly recommend to live here
747976,541428934,10/5/2019,"It's a bit far away from the center of Dublin, but it's a really quiet neighborhood and James is a great and helpful host."

761912,466522662,6/9/2019,"Great hosts, Sharon and Michael are very welcoming and very communicative. They went the extra miles with welcoming us from picking up at airport to booking our taxis. Great personality."
761912,475524239,6/24/2019,"Sharon and Michael were lovely hosts . Very welcoming and laid back. Our ferry was cancelled so we arrived after midnight , but Sharon was so understanding and welcoming when we did arrive. ( we had messaged our ETA , once we knew what our alternative travel plans were) . Sharon also made us delicious pancakes for one of our breakfasts . We were also told to help ourselves to tea , coffee , orange juice., Toast , eggs,  fruit and conserves every morning. We could also come and go as we pleased as Sharon gave us a front door key. 
We had a family room with en-suite shower room. The beds and pillows were comfortable and the room was quiet. 
We would certainly stay here again . Excellent position for attending concerts at Malahide Castle as its only a short walk away. 
Thank you Sharon and Michael for a very comfortable stay."
761912,486825645,7/13/2019,"Sharon and Michael were wonderful hosts. We felt completely at home. Highly recommend staying with them,"

We enjoy the breakfast and chitchat too(she even make us pancakes on the weekend). The house is amazing, we were very lucky to be able to enjoy the garden with such a wonderful weather. The location is great! very easy to go everywhere. Walking distance to Malahide center. Highly recommended!!! Thank you Sharon & Michael."
761912,526692939,9/9/2019,Sharon and Michael were wonderfully welcoming and helpful. They made our stay absolutely lovely. The house is beautiful and the room clean and spacious.

761912,528474287,9/13/2019,All great.
761912,530707354,9/16/2019,"Great location and value! Sharon and Micheal are lovely folks who were wonderful to hang out with. Nice family - very family atmosphere so if going with the flowù of a family life is not your thing, move on (the room is very private). But if you are open to the experience of meeting and hanging with new friends, youll love it!"
761912,534979003,9/23/2019,"It was a lovely space, and we felt welcomed by the whole family. They  even offered us a lift into town and lots of pointers on their city."
761912,538949807,9/30/2019,"Sharon and Michael were warm and welcoming hosts.  We enjoyed talking with them and their family.  They had helpful suggestions and hints for our time in Malahide Village and Castle, and we appreciated that they could hold our luggage until checkin time since we arrived early.  We had just completed a 2-week tour and so spent most of our time resting or sleeping when we were at the house and the space served our needs well."
800026,419595613,3/4/2019,Place is worse than a hostel.
800026,423864232,3/15/2019,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
800026,424229635,3/16/2019,"Roy is a very hospitable host. The apartments are small but theyre perfect for big groups that are looking for a place to stay all together. The location is also good, a safe zone and near a supermarket and bus stops that take you to the center in 10 minutes. I highly recommend Roys apartments."
800026,431003184,3/31/2019,Ideaal voor een weekendje met vrienden!
800026,434063322,4/7/2019,"Clean rooms. Everything was fine. Roy can give you good advises for a great stay.
Thanks!"
800026,440772588,4/21/2019,Absolutely spot on for groups. We went on a stag weekend with a large group of lads and this b&b is exactly what we wanted. Not from from town centre and great spot to chill and socialise during the day.
800026,449200628,5/6/2019,"Great place, especially for the cost! Nice and clean and a good place to stay for a stag do. Host was excellent; helpful about any problems and knowledgeable about the local area. 

We personally feel the pictures undersell the place, a lot more room when you see it in person! 

Great place to stay, would highly recommend it."
800026,458578567,5/26/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin.
800026,462756641,6/2/2019,"If you're with a group looking for a great experience of Irish hospitality and party is on your agenda, this is the place for you!"

800026,502903812,8/5/2019,"Great place for a large group that doesnt want to break the bank, close to local pubs, grocery stores, and public transportation.  Walking distance to the downtown area as well if you dont mind the 30-45 minute walk and want to enjoy the local culture.  Roy and Ellen were very hospitable, sharing tips on places to go and things to do that were very helpful."
800026,516659993,8/24/2019,The host canceled this reservation 231 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
800026,517250262,8/25/2019,"Roy was a very warm and kind host who responded promptly to our questions. Unfortunately, this is the first property (in 4 years on Airbnb) I have felt compelled to give a critical review. (1) Airbnb should never have listed this under 'entire place'. The description says it is only 'entire place' if 10 people book. We had nine, and although Roy didn't host anyone else, his description claims he could have. Further, there was someone walking through the halls late at night talking on the phone, which has never happened in another 'entire place' booking. (2) I would recommend clearly reading the whole description more carefully than normal. Even so, I feel some of what is said (and not said) is misleading. The 'kitchen come sitting room' is really a small kitchen with a small table. He never mentions that there is no living room. (3) He also never mentions that the property is disjointed. My in-laws stayed in one section of the house, and they had to walk outside to the kitchen. The rest of us stayed in another part of the house, and we also had to walk outside to get to the kitchen. It was an Airbnb built around three sides of a house, not a single unit. (4) The upkeep of the property was not great, and we felt more like we were in a camp than somewhere 'warm and cozy'. The hot water system was not equipped to handle a large group taking short showers, and Roy advertises enough beds for 5 more people. (5) The price was out of proportion to the value. If you are having a Stag party, this property works well, but I would not recommend it for other groups."
800026,525963177,9/8/2019,"Lovely, clean accommodation. Roy is a great host and nothing was too much trouble. Great value for money we will definitely be back"
800026,546015598,10/13/2019,"Roy was very nice and gave a lot of informations for our trip to Dublin.
Excellent house for stag or hens party."
816039,422509870,3/11/2019,"My family and I stayed during 3 nights in Susan's appartment. She is the most friendly and thoughtful host we could have hoped for! The appartment is spaceful, clean and the fridge and cupboards were already filled when we arrived! There are several pubs close to the place where it's possible to eat and have a drink and the bus stop is only 10 min away. I would definitely recommand it for whoever wants to have a unique time in Dublin. Thanks from all the family! Thomas"
816039,459329361,5/27/2019,"Susans home was perfect and as advertised. Weve used Airbnb for years, but have never had a host make us feel like neighbors. Ingredients for breakfast were included in our stay, and that was extremely helpful for a large group of people. Our 81 year old grandfather was struggling with the jet lag from traveling from the states, and she went out of her way to make sure he was comfortable settling in, and even checked in on him over our stay. We loved Hole In The Wall, and she had wonderful recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants. Hands down, 5 star host, 5 star home. Well be back! Thanks again, Susan!"
816039,469207750,6/14/2019,"Susan is amazing! Great place to stay and a great location to stay. Susan is super helpful from pre-booking right through your checking out. She went out of her way to make my family feel comfortable. Her home is super clean and has a great layout for a family or group. She helped with local transportation which was amazing!! While we were staying here she sent text messages with suggestions for touring and where to dine. This was incredibly helpful.  This was our first Airbnb and Susan made it unforgettable! 
Highly recommend booking with Susan shes great. Well be back. 
Steve"
816039,483029314,7/7/2019,"Host was amazing and made our stay more enjoyable.

Thank you!!!"
816039,513986259,8/20/2019,"Wonderful Experience! My group of four had differing arrival and departure times, and Susan was very flexible and helped all of us arrive and depart easily. With her help, we were able to have transport arranged with Bob and other cabbies (more about Bob in a minute.) That was a tremendous help. Each person had their own space, and the common areas (kitchen and living room) were quite large and comfortable. Susan provided a few groceries in the refrigerator for breakfast items, and that was very helpful on Day One.   Susan was available and nearby, and helped us Americans with using the washer/dryer. While in the neighborhood, be sure to visit the nearby bakery, and, of course, The Hole in the Wall pub.
More about Bob: Susan works with a couple of cab drivers, and by all means, you MUST use them. Bob in particular, was a great Dublin host, showing us all of the highlights, and offering suggestions on what to do, and when. Bob also helped us arrange a dinner for 35 in less than 20 minutes, using his local connections (WOW!) But most of all, his unfailing good cheer, good humor and generous hospitality really was an extra special layer of person-to-person connection which makes any journey special. Be sure to ask him to see pictures of his dog! If you are looking for an immersive experience in Dublin life, then book this place. This is a great place for families or large groups, and you are sure to be well cared for by Susan."
816039,523353459,9/3/2019,A nice home....Susan couldnt have been more accommodating and helpful in acclimating our group to traveling in and around Dublin.  The walk to the train was a bit farther than expected but otherwise very convenient in the City Center and generally a short taxi ride to anywhere in the city.
860339,545007673,10/11/2019,Host was nice and place was stylish. 2 lovely big dogs. Really enjoyed my stay
860339,546077415,10/13/2019,Una familia muy agradable y hospitalaria.

870350,434631401,4/8/2019,"This is a great location just outside Dublin centre with all amenities within 5minutes walk of your doorstep, 3 minutes walk to the dart and your in to Tara street station within 15-20mins. Loved it."
870350,464240949,6/5/2019,Sheelagh is Amazing and also the apartment. We had everything we need in and out!!!
870350,473251761,6/21/2019,"Sheelagh's place is a wonderful spot for relaxing and unwinding.  We stayed for a week and fell in love with the area - Malahide has everything you'd want and then some.  We loved the location of the apartment with a small park right out front, and groceries, coffee, and a pub mere steps away.  The train station is a 4 block walk, and on the way there you'll pass multiple restaurants, pharmacies, and a cab rental.  Everything is so easy and convenient to get to that it really is the perfect location for a getaway.

The apartment is bright and airy, and we loved the extra room and amenities like a washing machine and dinning room table.  One thing of note: the apartment has a shower and no tub.  While this wasn't an issue for us at all, it might be something to consider if you're traveling with small children.  

We loved Sheelagh's place, and will hopefully be back to visit!"
870350,506292928,8/10/2019,Great place in the heart of Malahide village. Fully equipped kitchen was perfect for self catering although there are so many restaurants in Malahide to choose from that you may not want to cook
870350,527988848,9/12/2019,"Our stay at the fabulous Malahide Marina home hosted by Sheelagh was a welcome respite from the hurly burly of Dublin. Not only was the space just right for two it would easily hold 3 more. The kitchen had what we needed to do simple meal prep, and the shower was fantastic. All of that pales however when I think of the excellent location in Malahide. We could easily walk to the train station and using our LEAP Card, purchased in a machine at the train station, get into Dublin in about 20 minutes. We also used our LEAP card to ride local buses. 

This listing has what you need, including a hair dryer, washer/dryer combo, comfortable beds AND the sea/marina to your left of the front door when facing The Green. To the right of The Green is Tesco Express and Starbucks. Up on the next corner is Marios Pizza, where we shared a pizza. On another day we stopped into Gibneys, a pub, where we had excellent fish and chips. On our last day we found Thats Amore on Townyard Lane where we had a delicious and reasonably priced lunch.  

We enjoyed our excellent and informative visit to Malahide Castle and the Gardens. To see the Castle one must take the guided tour which provides the history of the castle and the Talbots who owned the castle for hundreds of years until fairly recently. This ticket includes the gardens and the Butterfly House. Do like we did and take a picnic lunch and enjoy whilst sitting on a bench in the Garden. We continued, after our lunch, exploring all the remaining garden areas. After we rewarded ourselves with tea and delicious cake in the Avoca Cafe which is in the Visitors Center. 

Quite by accident we learned about Toots,  a Tram/Train one can get at the Malahide train station and ride right up to the Castles Visitors Center as well as return to the train station or other stops in Malahide. This was much easier than the long walk from the bus stop to the Castle. 

Sheelaghs place represents the best of both worlds in my opinionîaccess to exciting Dublin and a quiet, restful place to unwind after Dublin or to just relax on a day off from the city. Thank you Sheelagh!"
872539,418533442,3/2/2019,"Spacious, bright, comfortable, spotlessly clean, warm. Very handy for bus into town. Lidl and Aldi just around the corner. On street parking  right outside. Good value given we felt very much at home. Appreciated the breakfast supplies and freshly ground coffee. Thanks Aida."
872539,441949881,4/22/2019,"We were very happy to stay in this apartment. Stylish! Different zones for personal space. We can watch Tv, read books ( many great art books), cook or sleeping and everybody has own place. And I forget mention small garden with terrace and two beautiful pigeons in trees...Great place where to stay in Doublin"
872539,459264244,5/27/2019,"Aidas place is a stunningly renovated Victorian row house. It is very spacious with two separate lounge areas, a well equipped kitchen and comfortable beds in the bedrooms. We found parking readily available on the street outside, which is not easy to find in Dublin properties. Although buses are available to the center of Dublin, it is only a 20-30 minute walk. There was also a lovely garden outside, with a country feel. Aida was there there to welcome us when we arrived and made us feel at home. We also appreciated the breakfast supplies that she left for us. We would highly recommend Aidas property to other guests."
872539,467438270,6/10/2019,Aidas place is perfectly locate for Dublin.  A quick 5 minute ride on the bus gets you into town.  Easy access to expressways gets you everywhere else.  This is a beautiful home and wonderful host!  I highly recommend Aidas for a group of 4 people.  Easy car park in front.  Beautiful home! Lovely host!
872539,474686498,6/23/2019,"Really classy and stylish
Not everyone will get on with the steps!
Only one toilet (and that downstairs) not ideal"
872539,489182166,7/16/2019,"Great apartment in residential area. Clean, quiet, very roomy, and comfortable. Nice patio in backyard, and great light from large windows into the eat-in kitchen. Stylish decor comfortable bed. Great patio/yard. One of the best airbnbs we have stayed at (of probably 30 or so). So comfortable that we didnt want to leave it. Highly recommend. One drawback is that bedroom is upstairs, and toilet is downstairs."
872539,493219663,7/22/2019,"Aidas place is really clean and comfortable with a really nice architecture together with all the cosy details! And.... we could sit in the ‚òÄÔ∏è in the garden even in Dublin. 
The welcome and communication was really fine. Aida left us some fresh food in the refrigerator and it was really nice we could check in earlier and check out later without any problem.
Its about 20 minutes walking to the centre. Close there are many busses to Howth or the pubs in the centre!
Thank you Aida fore your hospitality! We really can recommend your place"
872539,504915093,8/8/2019,"A wonderful unique house, quietly hidden behind a traditional Dublin terrace front. It is surprisingly spacious and full of daylight. A stylish home with a well landscaped garden too. We mainly used an app for taxis but the bus stop is just at the end of the street. Also its an easy enjoyable walk to Clontarf or the other way to the City centre. Locally is a good Italian restaurant, pub and surprising Japanese take away."
872539,529872894,9/15/2019,"The house is very much as detailed in the photos, very spacious with a really nice patio area.  It was spotless and very well equipped
Parking was no problem the three days we were there, road is very quiet
Great stay!"
872539,534243581,9/22/2019,The host canceled this reservation 174 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
872539,543269454,10/7/2019,We had a great weekend stay.  Restaurants and bars are located nearby.  House was sparkly clean.  Aida very helpful and answered all our questions fast and comprehensively.  Five star accomodation.  Thank you

884599,483308266,7/7/2019,Great location near the airport. Sandra is very willing to give tips how to get to the airport/ city centre on a budget.
884599,517398160,8/25/2019,"Very accommodating, lovely room. Very easy access to airport. Sandra was very easy to deal with. Would highly recommend."
884599,529146837,9/14/2019,"A genuinely sincere person in Sandra, she has a heart of gold"
884599,532192584,9/19/2019,"Esperienze da dimenticare. Spero che a nessun altro capiti lo stesso.
Dopo aver fatto il check in  , mi sono trovato a condividere l'appartamento  con un altra persona, mentre la famiglia con una bambina dormivano sul divano in salotto. Ho detto all' host che sarei andato fuori per cena quindi mi hanno accompagnato alla porta senza lasciarmi le chiavi , affermando che mi avrebbero aspettato e che avrebbero aperto loro. Gia' alle 9.45 p.m. ha iniziato con messaggi per chiedermi quando tornavo a casa e di sbrigarmi. Fatto cio' alle 10.15 p.m. alla porta viene ad aprirmi il marito , con fare tutt'altro che gentile anzi molto seccato. La colazione come da annuncio doveva essere dalle 9.00 a.m. alle 10.00 a.m., con successivo check out alle 11.00 a.m. Indovinate un po' , alle 6.40 a.m. Lei mi sveglia con messaggi dicendo che dovevo lasciare la stanza perche dovevano andare a lavoro e portare la bimba a scuola. Colazione? Non mi spettava , il marito in continuazione a bussare alla porta . Un fastidio unico . Volevo dormire , ero in vacanza xon un aereo di pomeriggio. Alla fine mandavo via
Me ne sono andato con tutta tranquillita' e spero che dopo aver scritto , altri pensano 100 volte prima di prenotare da queste persone. La chiave della camera niente, la camera della bambina non avete privacy . Spero non succeda mai piu'"
884599,537068694,9/28/2019,"Sandra,thanks for hosting."
898411,430351074,3/30/2019,It was a pleasure be host from Dave we really felt like home. The house is in a perfect position is very comfortable cosy and clean. We highly recommend it! Also Dave is a very good host even if he was traveling he gave us lots of tips about Dublin and he help us a lot. 5 star for Davee and his helper Steve:)
898411,432245861,4/3/2019,"Dave is very responsive and the location is in the heart of temple bar. Everything was walkable, which made our trip so accessible!"
898411,436117169,4/12/2019,"If youre considering booking Daves place, dont hesitate for one second! It is in the absolute BEST part of Dublin, central to all the good clubs, bars, restaurants, etc! I booked a lot of tours on my trip as well and all of the meet up points were only a 5 minute walk from the apartment and considering these tours start generally at 7AM, its a major bonus to get that extra sleep, especially if youre experiencing jet lag! The apartment is fully stocked with absolutely everything that you could possibly need and even things that you wouldnt have thought you needed haha Dave is very detail oriented with every aspect of the trip, from checking in and things to do and checking out. I honestly cant rave enough about my experience. Would 110% recommend and I would definitely be staying at his place, when Im in Dublin again."
898411,438743847,4/17/2019,"Daves place was in the perfect location to see all the sights of Dublin. We were in the heart of Temple Bar, but on the quieter sides We also were a few minutes walk to Trinity College and the Christchurch cathedral. Great spot for exploring Dublin for a few days."
898411,444638886,4/28/2019,The apartment is very well located and the own bathroom is a big advantage. Steve was very helpful und friendly. I enjoyed my stay
898411,448632474,5/5/2019,"Dave's place was really clean, spacious, and centrally located to nearly everything we wanted to see in Dublin. I appreciated his great resources for navigating the city, and he replied to any inquiries very promptly. He also provided a plug adapter and phone charging cables, which was really appreciated. I would definitely stay at his place again!"
898411,450789857,5/10/2019,"Dave was a gracious host! He was very communicative, the room was clean and the apartment had everything we needed for outlet 5-day stay. Close to everything you could need as well."
898411,452901138,5/14/2019,"You cant beat the location of Daves place. Right above a great breakfast spot, 5 minute walk to Temple area, it was great. I had room B I believe which had the bathroom in the room which was really nice. The bed is a bit hard as its 2 twin beds put together. I always felt safe as you go through a few locked doors to get into the building. Dave was great about communication and sent lots of recommendations. I do recommend this place!"
898411,456771659,5/22/2019,Daves place is lovely and within walking distant to many restaurants and tourist attractions in the core of Dublin. Dave is also super fast with his responses prior and during our stay. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Daves place.
898411,460524889,5/29/2019,"More than perfect. Even though his absence, he has arranged the check in process in a perfect way through his co-host. And he was very prompt answering all my questions from US. I would highly recommend Dave's place.
Thank you Dave!"
898411,463886532,6/4/2019,"We would not recommend this place for the following reasons :
- too expensive for what you get despite the location. Dave is banking solely on the central location but doesnt offer a comfortable space
- too cluttered with personal belongings
- not clean and welcoming, mouldy bathroom, dirty stained carpet
- poor facilities : poor quality threadbare old bedding and towels, shower wasnt working and wasnt being fixed while we were there for 4 nights"
898411,527195322,9/10/2019,"Dave and Dwaine were really kind. The appartement have a really good location. Very good week ! 
See you soon"
898411,531752618,9/18/2019,Great location and helpful trip advice.  Would stay again.
898411,537325849,9/28/2019,"Dave is awesome! He responds fast and he has many tips to the city and to his apartment. It was clean, the place is amazing, and it is very central to the city. Although Dave was out of country at the time, he has companions that help with everything and he is still quick to respond. I would recommend this place to anyone and I will stay again next time I can visit Dublin!"
898411,538927303,9/30/2019,"Our stay was great. The location is excellent,  only a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar and we were away from all the noise."
898411,543719067,10/8/2019,Home was lovely and in a super great location. David and Dwain were super easy to communicate with and helpful. Room is a good size for two people and I appreciated I was able to do laundry as I packed for two weeks in a carry on. Room was clean and bathroom was larger than most Ive seen in Dublin apartments.
898411,547912934,10/16/2019,"Great location, good host, and a very cozy apartment. We would stay there again for sure."
898411,553447001,10/24/2019,I loved the days I spent at Dave's apartment.  My suite was spacious and very comfortable.  All clean.  And the location is really excellent!  Just one day I had trouble getting into the building due to a lock problem.  I was lucky because someone in the building was on the porch and opened the door so I could enter.  It was already midnight.  Despite this incident I would return to the same place in Dublin. I recomend!
898411,555940684,10/28/2019,"Great location! Walkable to pretty much everywhere in the city and very close to a bus stop. There is a lot of city noise through the windows which is not surprising considering the location, but my husband and I were woken up several times every night. Would recommend ear plugs. It was so nice to have a washing machine and dryer so we didnt have to carry too many clothes. The master suite was large and the bathroom was very nice. Our greeter was excellent as well."
922425,441908338,4/22/2019,Daragh is a great host. His tips are great. This avoids the typical tourist hot spots. Everything was just great! Dublin and Daragh's house are always worth a visit.

922425,464778721,6/6/2019,We had a lovely stay at Daragh's. Everything was as advertised but the hospitality was above & beyond. We really appreciated how helpful Daragh is and the help with what to see and do. The location is excellent and we'd definitely stay there again.
922425,471395951,6/17/2019,Daraghs place was perfect for our stay in Dublin. The location couldnt be better- located within walking distance to everything but on a quiet street.

922425,480220376,7/2/2019,Perfect retreat: so quiet after a day in the city and yet right on the doorstep for everything we wanted to see in Dublin. The outside space was a real bonus and the safe parking right outside. Thank you
922425,481677761,7/5/2019,"Daragh's home was wonderful and homey.  It is located in absolutely the best neighborhood for those wishing to see all of the main attractions.  We were able to walk everywhere - Christchurch cathedral, Grafton Street, Trinity College and the Guinness Storehouse.  It was perfect for our family of four!  Daragh also provided us with many recommendations and tips which was very helpful as it was our first trip to Dublin."
922425,486938963,7/13/2019,Friendly hosts with a great place close to Christschurch - we walked all over Dublin from their place! Edgar and Daragh both gave us lots of recommendations of places to go while we were there. The rooftop deck is an awesome place to relax with a beer after a long day of sightseeing. Would absolutely stay here again!
922425,492356707,7/21/2019,"Daraghs townhouse was lovely. Its centrally located, within walking distance to all the things you need. Daragh provided a fantastic list of cafes, bars and restaurants, which was very helpful to us. Thanks for letting us stay!"

This place was perfect for us! we had two couples and there was plenty of room to cook dinner, enjoy the outdoor terrace, and relax.  The location was also perfect! I didn't realize before booking how perfect the location would be. It's so close to everything. When we checked in Daragh left us the most delicious lemon tart cake which we drooled over for two days and he also gave us so many recommendations for our short stay. Only downside is we didn't get to stay for longer!"

We only stayed 1.5 days in Dublin, but everything we visited was between a 7-18 minute walk from the townhouse. We felt like locals! Daragh also provided a tremendous list of recommendations (definitely eat at Queen of Tarts!), and is so friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend to anyone hoping to get the most out of their Dublin stay!"

929816,433947817,4/7/2019,"Ashton's stylish home is bright, warm and welcoming.  His breakfast was nourishing and health-laden.  The linens and bed were lovely, and the private bath was fully stocked with soft, absorbent towels and all amenities.  It is a great location for walking along the Grand Canal and reaching most sites of City Central by foot, such as St. Stephen's Green, Guinness, Trinity College and Teeling Distillery."

However, he was in touch with me all throughout my stay to make sure I had everything I needed and to provide some great recommendations.  The location was in a newer area of the city and just a 20-30 minute walk to the center.  Would highly recommend a stay here!"
929816,449346938,5/6/2019,"Excellent hosts with numerous and great recommendations. The place was really clean and tidy with access to a very well stocked kitchen. Flat is probably 10-15 minutes from the centre of town and really easy to get to from the airport.

936063,418536292,3/2/2019,"You mightve felt your past Airbnb experiences were great, even unbeatable. Unfortunately you are wrong. Des and Sinead have created a new standard for hospitality. It is OUTSTANDING. They always had food, tips, and quick responses. They picked us up from the airport and looked out for us, giving us printouts so we would know how to get around town. Not to mention they are friendly and great conversationalists. They are exceptional, and I wish I were there for the rest of my trip."
936063,419947494,3/5/2019,We arrived strangers and left family. These are some of the kindest people you will ever meet. They helped us plan things to do in the city and along the cliffs. Would recommend to anyone!

936063,426237048,3/20/2019,"The epitome of great hosts! I was somewhat concerned staying there as they also live in the home. Mainly because I know my crowd is loud. And they accommodated 11 of us. 11 different personalities for 7 nights. They handled us like pros. Such attentive hosts, they were kind, and were always making sure that we got what we needed. They are phenomenal. Cheers! Stay with them, you wont regret it."
936063,426915717,3/22/2019,Very close to the Dublin Airport in a quiet little town.  If you like a bed and breakfast this is the place for you.  Des & Sinead are there in the home with you during your stay and are very helpful.

They made everything easy, like picking up from the airport and dropping me off at the bus stop to get to the city center. We had a great time in their kitchen talking and sharing a drink, and I wish I couldve spent more than just a night here. Stay with these hosts while you still can, theyre fabulous."

936063,440080234,4/20/2019,Sinead was so helpful in making sure I had everything I needed and that I knew how I was going to get from one place to the next.  I was traveling alone and she seemed genuinely interested in making sure I was able to enjoy the beautiful city without getting myself lost in it!  The airport pick up was a nice perk and the bus stop is a short walk.
936063,442346813,4/23/2019,"The room was perfect and was close to the airport which was great for our flight. Although breakfast was included, other guests were permitted to smoke right outside the kitchen and the smell of smoke was so strong we couldn't stay to enjoy breakfast."

The room is sparkling clean and perfect for our family of four it had its own dedicated bathroom and shower.

Located North of Dublin, taxis back in the evening are 20-30euro, there's also Buses which Sinead will talk you through - they're easy too. 
As a family we've not used airbnb before, I hope that all hosts are in Des and Sineads calibre. Thank you to you both."

936063,512365232,8/18/2019,"Des and Sinead and very generous, kind, helpful, and flexible. Without their help, our final day touring the beautiful Howth and Malahide fishing villages would have been very difficult. Sinead dropped us off at the best spot on the cliffs of Howth, showed us which paths to hike, and even took pictures of our family. Later that evening, Sinead picked us up in Malahide. In the morning, Sinead made our family a lovely breakfast and coffee before sending us off.

936063,520462702,8/30/2019,"Amazing hosts, Des and Sinead stand head and shoulders above any of the other six AirBNB hosts we experienced on our Ireland-Italy-Switzerland tour. They were all very good, but Swords was by far the most comfortable and accommodating without question.

Cheers Des & Sinead."
936063,539954721,10/2/2019,"Im not usually stuck for words, so this is a first. We stayed with Des and Sinead on the last night of our month-long holiday in England, Scotland, and Ireland. I could not have picked a better place to stay. Their hospitality is simply outstanding; they both went above and beyond at every opportunity. We arrived as strangers and left the next morning as friends. It was the last night of my 86yo mums last trip overseas and she loved every minute of it.

We stayed in the double room which was on the 3rd floor- lots of stairs. We could hear the airplanes in the distance all night, but it wasn't too loud. They made sure to have breakfast ready for us even though we left early to catch our flight. A great place to stay."

998407,449178983,5/6/2019,"Best place to stay while visiting Dublin. The city center was  easy to reach by the bikes they provided for us. Also free of charge!! Very nice neighborhood and nice place to rest. Very warm, two heaters if needed!!! Thank you for everything again! xx"

998407,459240336,5/27/2019,"Clean, private place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. Have to pass through some tighter places to reach the apartment which can be a tiny bit challenging with luggage or bodily heft. Very kind and accommodating hosts!

Takes about 40 minutes between the walking and bus ride to get to the city center. Make sure you have 3 euros in exact change!"
998407,467267088,6/10/2019,"Amanda and Paul are very friendly hosts, that provide a little flat in their garden. The place is self-contained and if you are staying here you will definitely have time for yourself. The place is comfy but a bit cold. 
The bus and train station are further away then described."

Location is a bit of a distance from Dublin town but tbh we found our way around easy enough with buses.  Only problem was the bed , very uncomfortable but again for the price and you own place its something you would expect"
998407,493262234,7/22/2019,Very quiet and well located!
998407,498239485,7/29/2019,"Hi Amanda! 
Thank you so much for the weekend! We thoroughly enjoyed staying at your place! It was cute and comfortable, having read a couple of reviews about the uncomfortable sofa bed we were a bit apprehensive however we had the best sleep (might have been because we didnt stop all weekend)! 
The addition of the bikes was great and we made good use of them on a long cycle to the local fishing village on the Sunday! 
Although a note was left about only having a short shower, I managed to wash my hair when I needed without getting a surprise attack from ice cold water!
There were enough plates and cutlery and the cooking facilities were ample! 
A quick response to any queries was received! 

Overall a lovely first stay in Ireland! Thank you very much!"
998407,502922441,8/5/2019,Amanda and Paul's place was great! They have a ton of information about the studio and things to do around Ireland. The amenities were great for our stay and there is street parking for people that are driving. There is negative reviews of the bed but there is extra bedding we used to make it more comfortable. Overall It was a great stay!
998407,508184178,8/12/2019,"Our stay at Amandas appartement was good. The late checkin and checkout were great and fast. Sadly the tv wasn't really working. The appartement is very close to the airport, but it takes a while to go to the city center. All in all we were happy to chose this appartement because it had all we needed and was very close to the airport."
998407,522460307,9/2/2019,"Location is further afield from Dublin than anticipated, however we had to cut our holiday short due to unfortunate circumstances so cannot comment much. The house was easy to find, a little hard to get luggage round the side gate past the oil tank."
998407,530801496,9/16/2019,Lovely place and lovely hosts...everything was working and had help when I needed. Very clean and well located. I definitely recommend 
998407,536806751,9/27/2019,"The place was clean and cozy. The transit to get downtown was very easy and available at any time at night. There was a strange sound continuously throughout the night, so if youre a light sleeper I would bring ear plugs. Besides that, the place was good."
998407,546101969,10/13/2019,"Nice small place for a decent price. It is a bit out of town, but its easy enough to get to centre with a bus. Amanda was always quick to respond and help out with wathever we needed. It was a pleasant stay."
998407,552703244,10/22/2019,"A very pretty house, in a strategic position. Easy to get from the airport and also easy to reach the down town in a short time. The description of the house and the services is rather accurate. The owners are available people and the communication is fast. It was a good stay"
998407,554400927,10/26/2019,"The place was lovely and only a short bus ride from town. Perfect location for a day trip to Howth and for visiting Dublin. The sofa-bed was comfortable and the kitchen was perfect for what we needed. Nice location, good price, well worth it."

1017861,446414867,5/1/2019,Mooie plek in een van de buiten wijken van Dublin. Goed bereikbaar. Prettige gezellige kamer. Van alle gemakken voorzien.
1017861,481125351,7/4/2019,Everything is perfect accept for the sun to come too early in the room. It would be better if there would be something to keep the room dark in the morning. Bud we were really happy to stay at Rob and Stefs room. Very good bed to sleep and very quiet place and all the book about Ireland and Dublin were  very nice. We would stay again at their house if we come back.
1017861,508826173,8/13/2019,"People very friendly and helpful. The place is also very nice but a little bit far from the center.

Will be better if there is a bin in the room"
1064692,439128346,4/18/2019,Room was little small but sufficient for 1 person. Sean was very friendly. The house is located within walking distance from city center. Overall I had a comfortable stay.
1064692,440928752,4/21/2019,"Great location, and a great host in an amazing city! Only about a 15 minute walk (with great views) to downtown. Loved my stay at Sean's place. He has a great personality. It is because of people like him that I prefer Airbnb over staying at an impersonal hotel. I highly recommend Sean's place!"
1064692,448633666,5/5/2019,The advertisement is exactly correct.  I was quite comfortable.  Sean was a great host and the location was exceptional!

1064692,466355805,6/9/2019,"Sean was a great host! He was very available and nice! The location of his house is awesome, near the city centre and easy to find from the airport. If you dont mind about the noise of a musical band (what a really enjoy), thats the place!"
1064692,470474259,6/16/2019,"Seans place is not only in the perfect location (easy walk to nearly every part of the city, I saw so much by walking just a 3km perimeter) but the space is very nice and makes you feel at home. Pictures are accurate and I felt right at home immediately. Plus if youre musically inclined, youll get along with Sean in a heartbeat! Super welcoming, helpful, and fun host; highly recommend!"
1064692,490875272,7/19/2019,"I stayed at Seans place for two weeks and had the BEST time! Him and his housemates were all super welcoming, great fun and really made me feel at home whilst I got myself set up for a new life in Dublin. Was genuinely a little sad to leave and cant recommend staying with him enough."
1073487,468014645,6/11/2019,"For at least two people living under the same roof and only one bathroom for all people it should be not allowed to host strangers. No privacy!! Walls are so thin that any noise is heard in the entire home. Attitude of host is more than annoying. Issues with cleaning, everywhere in the home there are flying hairs of the 2 cats and 2 dogs running around. Disappointed as the price paid was very high compared to what you get...."
1073487,468767419,6/13/2019,Excellent accommodation and friendly welcome.
1073487,471817442,6/18/2019,"I loved staying at Jane and James' and can only fully recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin. They are a wonderful, openminded family and such sweet and caring hosts. I was warmly received by Jane who got in touch with me the second I arrived at the airport and came to pick me up at the bus station... and Jane and James made me feel super welcome and at home throughout my stay as well. We sat together and chatted over a lovely (healthy, organic) breakfast, and Jane even invited me to join them for a Sunday walk to Wicklow... 
The  house and room itself are beautiful and very clean (the bathroom is new!) and exactly as described in the pictures. I particularly liked the location - the house is located conveniently close to the LUAS line, yet in a quiet neighbourhood so you will find some peace and quiet after a hectic day in the city. I would gladly return! Thank you so much again, Jane and James!"
1073487,472730804,6/20/2019,"Hello, I enjoyed the brightness of the room and the cleanliness of local. Jane is very welcoming."
1073487,485771308,7/11/2019,I had a lovely time at Janes place. Check-in was easy and communication was fast and efficient. Ideal location close to UCD. Would stay again. Thank you!
1073487,498201822,7/29/2019,"Jane is wonderful, nice, and so attentive to everything! Her place is a short walk from UCD and Luas, excellent place!"
1073487,508161382,8/12/2019,Jane is a really kind person who seems to be very used to visitors so she is really relaxed! She does her best that her guests are feeling confortable. I really enjoyed my stay there.
1073487,514586461,8/21/2019,Warm-hearted hostess. Very clean. She invited me to a Barbecue party. Its really nice. I enjoyed it. I will definitely recommend to my friends if they come to Dublin.
1073487,525958730,9/8/2019,"Very good location, around 8 minutes to Luas and the mosque"

1076514,431641171,4/1/2019,"I really enjoyed my stay in Georgia and Gats basement suite! The location is absolutely amazing - it was a very quick walk to Temple Bar and surrounding area. Communication was also great, and they were very helpful with communication and recommendations. I would definitely stay here again."
1076514,445937557,4/30/2019,"My friend and I stayed at Georgia and Gar's place for a week. You simply cannot beat the location; we walked almost everywhere we wanted to go. The space is clean and stylish and minimalist, with everything we needed to make ourselves dinner we picked up at the grocery store down the block. The washer/dryer was key to packing light and traveling with only carry-on luggage. Georgia was always quick to respond and solve any problems/answer any questions. Top notch!"
1076514,449202174,5/6/2019,Central apartment - ideal for exploring Dublin. The flat was very clean and well equipped. Check in was easy and Georgia was a very good host. Everything we needed for our short break in Dublin
1076514,451890179,5/12/2019,"The place is clean, stylish and conveniently located in a central yet quiet area (about 7mins walk to Trinity college and another 5 to the Temple Bar area). Would recommend!"
1076514,466609297,6/9/2019,Nice apartment which is not far from the city centre but still quiet.
1076514,471843678,6/18/2019,"This is a great apartment and a great location at a great price. Forgivable obstacles at check-in were overcome. The kitchen is well-equipped, the bed is comfortable, and there are plenty of places to arrange ones things. A welcoming beer decorated the refrigerator. Internet bandwidth ranged from 110 Kbps to 30 Mbps. It was hard to buy a train ticket at the former bandwidth. The latter bandwidth was agreeable, but its presence was difficult to predict. The bed is a bit narrow for the available space, about 1.75 m. Having learned what I learned about Dublin staying there 6 nights, if this apartment were available I would be delighted to stay there again, ha!, even for a month. What a great place! If it is not in what the French call the hypercenterù, it is not very far from that place. Location, location, location."
1076514,474404799,6/23/2019,"What a weekend! We had such a great time!!!! And so close to Windmill Lane - for a U2 fan an unbeatable location! The flat is super, clean, comfortable and lovingly decorated! We also loved the environment friendly attitude and your quick and positive replies! Overall: We had THE best time! Dublin rocks and this place does too!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"

1076514,498867702,7/30/2019,I and two friends had an amazing stay in Dublin in Georgia's apartment! Especially the location is great! A quiet street with a supermarket a stone's throw away and a great beginning point to roam the city! All facilities were good too! Check in and check out went very smoothly and Georgia was very friendly and helpful.
1076514,502220691,8/4/2019,"A fantastic apartment with a great location, just a 10 minute walk from the centre of Dublin. Really clean with modern fixtures and fittings. Although we didnt meet Georgia, she was incredibly responsive in her messages and left us clear instructions for finding the flat as well as how to get in. The apartment had a double bed and a double sofa bed which was more than enough for my friend and I. Highly recommend this as a reasonably priced apartment in Dublin!"
1076514,511223854,8/17/2019,"Georgia and Gars place is in a walkable area of Dublin close to many things. The living room and bedroom are spacious and nice. WiFi and TV worked great. The bathroom could use some more cleaning and smelled a bit of mold. Shampoo and toiletries were almost empty when we arrived but we found more in the cabinet. Host responses were pretty slow but she said she was on a cycling trip with little reception. Overall, it was serviceable."
1076514,514423380,8/21/2019,Wonderful apartment within walking distance of Trinity College and surrounding sights.  We would recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Dublin.  We would definitely stay here again!
1076514,518138418,8/26/2019,Stay here for 4 nights having come over from England for the bank holiday weekend. Its around a 10 to 15 minute walk from the temple bar area. The place was clean and tidy and the sofa bed is comfortable. There is a supermarket at the end of the road too. All in all a very good find and would recommend.
1076514,542206263,10/6/2019,"Lovely, cosy flat. Very convenient location for town. Could do with a deep clean in the bathroom but otherwise perfectly cosy and comfortable."
1076514,546118832,10/13/2019,"Nice apartment, good location. But did not fully enjoy our stay as hot water stopped working half way through our 3 night stay and host did not reply to messages until after we checked out so we had no way to fix the problem. She said that air bnb messages did not go through so if you choose to stay here I would suggest you get a phone number or email to contact host if needed. Apartment was clean other than some old/dirty grouting and loose tiles around the shower in the bathroom."
1076514,551488181,10/20/2019,"Super apartment, location is brilliant, an easy  walk to all the sites, Temple bar only 15 minutes walk along the river.  Great supermarket across the road. Georgia was a great host and met us on our arrival, lovely extra touch of a bottle of wine, very thoughful."
1076514,568412192,11/24/2019,The flat was cosy and in a great location for all our needs. We were hardly in but found it was a good base. Thanks.
1076634,425859757,3/19/2019,The stay at Declan's was really lovely. Despite not being in the centre of the city it is on a direct bus line and with a Leap card the distance is no problem. The communication with Declan prior booking has been very quick. Declan is really friendly and helpful regarding tips in Dublin as well as in the neighbourhood. I would recommend Declan if you want to stay in a cosy room with a welcoming host.
1076634,434676753,4/8/2019,"Oustanding experience. It was all perfect. Room, bathroom, rules, the host. I felt at home! Declan is an amazing person and is always willing to help. Do not hesitate to stay if you are looking for a cozy and comfortable place."
1076634,451190214,5/11/2019,well stocked kitchen ...I look to cook.
1086416,419600509,3/4/2019,"This apartment was lovely! Stayed here for the weekend for our trip in Dublin. The location was brilliant, a 20min wall into the centre with sights to see on the way! And accessible pubs/restaurants to get to very close by. Couldnt fault the host, she provided us with everything we needed and was on hand to help if we needed anything. Thank you very much!"
1086416,421979301,3/10/2019,Eileens flat was a great home-base for our weekend in Dublin. Eileen was an amazing host and the communication was outstanding. There are pubs and restaurants close by that we enjoyed (Two Brothers Cafe and Jays Place for breakfast were delicious). It is walkable to get to the city centre but we relied mostly on taxis to get there. The flat itself was very clean and homey. Would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!
1086416,425519035,3/18/2019,"Eileen was exceptionally hospitable. The apartment is beautiful and the location is perfect, only a few minute was for the shops and central."
1086416,429273073,3/27/2019,"Eileen is a great host and very quick to respond. Eileens place was the perfect quiet location , but within walking distance from the city. It was very comforting having Eileen staying below us ; yet still incredibly private. I would recommend staying here. It was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you so much ! -Logan&Kurt"
1086416,431037215,3/31/2019,Great apartment and location - just what we were hoping for. Eileen was there to welcome us even though we arrived very late in the evening. Close to the centre and public transport. Would happily stay again!
1086416,434108304,4/7/2019,Eileen was such a lovely host. We really enjoyed our time in Dublin. She was very helpful and the flat is in a perfect location for a bus into town and even to the airport. Thanks so much for letting us stay! If I do come back to Dublin Id definitely book again!
1086416,438341310,4/16/2019,"A lovely home from home feeling. An excellent location, could walk into town but also the bus stop at the end of the road was very useful! Close to shops and nice pubs too."
1086416,439668410,4/19/2019,"We spent two nights at Eileens flat. She was great with communication and check in. Her flat was clean, sunny and quiet. We found it easy to get to downtown with public transportation. No complaints!"
1086416,443540803,4/26/2019,"We had a great stay at Eileens lovely and really well equipped apartment. Everything was found as described and the flat was absolutely clean.

1086416,454380163,5/18/2019,Eileens place is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin. Close enough to walk to attractions but far enough away to be quiet. Eileen was also wonderful to work with.
1086416,457111166,5/23/2019,Eileens place is spacious with lots of natural light along with a great view.  The location is excellent with buses and restaurants around the corner as well as historical sites nearby.
1086416,460043154,5/28/2019,"Eileen's place is wonderfully comfortable and very conveniently located within Dublin. It's far enough away from the pubs so you get some peace and quiet at night. However, it's very close to the bus lines, meaning you can be down to Parnell street in minutes. She's got a lovely updated bathroom. And a fully equipped kitchen. I'd highly recommend this apartment for your Dublin adventure!"
1086416,461942534,6/1/2019,"Eileen's place is comfy with a lovely view of the skyline from the living room. It's quiet, clean, and has a very comfortable bed. There is a pub and several good restaurant options nearby (I recommend Kebab House). To get to the main attractions it's about a 30-minute walk but if you want to cut that time in half, you can walk 4 minutes to Phibsborough Luas tram station (green line), which is a convenient way to travel to and from from Eileen's flat. There are also bus stops nearby if you have coins and exact change. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Dublin."
1086416,464740137,6/6/2019,"Eileen was a fantastic host, check in was quick and easy! Her flat is clean and has a beautiful view of the garden and church steeple. Every appliance works well and its very clean. There are some amenities in the kitchen like cereal and coffee. There are nearby shops to check out.

The flat was a great escape from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar. The neighborhood was quiet and safe at night.

We would definitely stay there again!"
1086416,466363724,6/9/2019,"Eileen's place was great, really clean and spacious. It was lovely for the two nights away, super comfy bed too. Eileen was great with communication and even allowed an early check in, which we were very appreciative of. Would happily stay again :)"

Eileens place is a lovely well lit apartment, equipped with good amenities for a most comfortable stay. Eileens place is conveniently located within walking distance to: 5-19 mins to Tesco supermarket, 2 mins to bus stop into the City centre or Blackrock, 4-5 mins Luas Tram stop for a quick ride to Temple Bar area, or a delightful 20-25 mins walk to OConnell Street.
Will prioritised to stay at Eileens place again as and when Im back to Dublin."
1086416,474406126,6/23/2019,"Eileens place was lovely, clean, and perfectly located for a stay in dublin. It states 20 minutes from town but although that may be the case it is down one main road, and there are a few great places nearby. Me and my girlfriend really liked the location, and eileen was the perfect host, she responded within 15 mins when we messaged her. Great weekend."
1086416,478987510,6/30/2019,"Eileen is a lovely host and we enjoyed our stay in her little flat. Its quite private and was just what we needed. We used the tram (Luas) to get around Dublin by purchasing a day flexi-pass, and the nearest stop is an easy 5-min walk. A Tesco is close as well as some restaurants. It was a nice location and not too far out of the city at all."
1086416,481237405,7/4/2019,Nice place near Dublin city center.
1086416,483324533,7/7/2019,"Great flat, ideally located for croke park, city centre and even the park and zoo (if you're up for walking a bit which we are!). Nice pubs and bars nearby, and shops close too. Eileen is a great host, quick communication, everything was easy and smooth. The flat has everything you'd need, is clean, well maintained and has great facilities. Highly recommended!"
1086416,492189290,7/21/2019,"Eileen's place is absolutely lovely, clean and feels very much like a home away from home! Great location - would absolutely recommend!"
1086416,494971757,7/25/2019,"Nice Appartement, Thank you Eileen for hosting us !"
1086416,499857638,8/1/2019,"This place was super! It was beautiful, spacious and in a nice quiet neighbourhood. The fact that it is bit of a walk from the city centre allowed us to discover a part of Dublin we may not have visited otherwise and enjoy a quiet stay! Eileen was also very available and quick to respond. Would definitely stay again and recommend it! Thanks again a bunch!!"
1086416,507112628,8/11/2019,"Besides how pleasant the flat was, the best part of this was the location and cool non-touristy neighborhood!"
1086416,510599722,8/16/2019,"Great spot about 15-20 minutes walking distance to Dublin City Center/Temple Bar area. Approx. 25 minute taxi ride from the airport. Apartment is right on the bus lines, but we didnt mind the daily walk into the city. Apartment was extremely clean, seemed recently renovated, and Eileen was an incredibly kind hostess! We recommend Two Brew Boys for coffee and breakfast, and BoCo for dinner which are both about a 10 minute walk from the flat. It was nice to spend time in Dublin during the day then have a quiet, private place to rest in the evenings."
1086416,514934460,8/22/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay.  Eileen is a great host and her apartment is just as described, very homely and sparkling clean. Everything we could ask for. Thank you Eileen"
1086416,525775202,9/8/2019,"Great one bedroom flat. Comes with shower over spa bath in the bathroom, well set up kitchen open plan living area with washing machine. Bus stop into town 2 minutes walk, tram 10 minutes walk, bus stop to airport 10 minute walk. 
Eileen was very helpful with check in and accommodating."
1086416,528652023,9/13/2019,"Eileen's place was great. Only spent a couple nights for the last bit of our journey but it was amazing! Bed was so comfy, very clean cute space. Close to the city centre. Around a 25 min walk. You can get a cab for 8-10 euros if you wish but the walk is quite nice. Eileen was nice and met us upon arrival. Very lovely to have met her and would definitely recommend."
1086416,532203315,9/19/2019,"Absolutely perfect little spot to stay in Dublin. Eileens place was incredibly clean, cute and had everything we needed. Also neighborhood was nice and quiet, but still fairly centrally located. Plus lots of good food just a couple blocks away. Eileen was also incredible kind and hospitable, but definitely gives you your space. Definitely recommend!"

1207950,460867491,5/30/2019,"This house was perfect. So were our guests. Ann was very informative and it helped us plan our days. The house was everything it was advertised to be.   Shopping close.  Train is close.  Taxi is there minutes after theyre called.  (Dont drive in Dublin). Leave it to professionals.  Parking is impossible anyway. 
Thanks Dave and Ann!"
1207950,464270258,6/5/2019,"A great home in a wonderful location. 

We were a family of 6 adults and 3 children and the house was perfect. The location was great! Public transport, hotels and shopping centre all within walking distance. 
Dave and Ann were very welcoming and were great hosts."
1207950,468812169,6/13/2019,"Dave and Ann are Super Hosts for good reason: Everything about their home is wonderful!  If you are finding this listing searching Dublin, and want a downtown location then look elsewhere.  However, if you would prefer to stay in a clean, quiet, lush, and secure neighborhood (as we do) then this is the place!  Dundrum City Center and the LUAS (electric tram to Dublin) are a short walk away.  
Great amenities, quick responses to questions, helpful hints, variety of food choices, shopping - this house and location have it all!"
1207950,476093162,6/25/2019,"We were a family of 7 staying at Dave & Anns for 5 days and we had a great time. The house was lovely and clean and had lots of toys for the kids to play with. There are 4 good sized bedrooms with double beds, and our hosts had an extra mattress and toddler bed for the kids. Everything we needed was provided and there was even food in the fridge for us upon arrival. Communication with our hosts was excellent, they were quick to reply and happy to help. The house is situated close to a big shopping center that also has restaurants. The Luas is a ten minute walk and takes only 15 minutes to city centre. The AirPort Shuttlebus is also only a few minutes walk from the house. We were very happy with our stay and will recommend this place to anyone looking to rent a vacation home in Dublin."
1207950,484133446,7/8/2019,"The house is very well equipped, beds are comfortable spotlessly clean nice location
And you are made to feel very welcome indeed."
1207950,491556340,7/20/2019,"Dave and Ann's home was definitely our favorite home in Ireland.  From the moment we arrived at their beautiful home and were greeted with Ann's kind smile, I knew our group of eight adults would be comfortable during our stay.  Ann explained everything we needed to know about the house, the appliances, and the local area.  They also have a very detailed book that reminded us of anything we needed to know, such as how to get to the nearest store, how to use the oven, and how to set the alarm.  (Some of us were a bit nervous using different appliances and alarm systems, but her instructions and the book made our apprehension completely unnecessary.)
Dave and Ann's home is beautiful, spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable, bright, and full of modern conveniences.  It is also well-insulated and very quiet at night despite proximity to a main road.  We spent a lot of time outside on the patio, and their yard is positively gorgeous.  We also loved the fantastic showers, the extremely comfortable beds, having an electric coffee maker, the well-equipped kitchen in which we cooked something nearly every day, the grill on the patio,  and having a clothes dryer since some of us did laundry on a day that it rained.  Our two friends who'd shared space with each other for a week were grateful to finally have their own rooms!  There was nothing missing or with which we weren't happy during our stay in this lovely home.
The location was perfect for us; we wanted to spend time in Dublin but didn't want to stay in the city.  We felt extremely safe in this home and in this area.  We were able to easily walk to the Luas stations and local shops, and car trips to Powerscourt, the mall, the airport, and various other places outside Dublin were also easy.  We didn't ride the bus, but the stop is only about a one minute walk from the house.  I absolutely recommend Dave and Ann's home as an ideal place for a family to stay near Dublin, and I would love to stay there again on our next trip!"
1207950,502146352,8/4/2019,"Great house for our family reunion. Spacious, very well set up. Everything you need and more. Lovely outdoor space with deck and garden. We felt very comfortable there. Very convenient for public transport into town. Lots of shopping close by. Recommend highly!"
1207950,506114301,8/10/2019,"An immaculately clean, well equipped, well appointed house with some thoughtful additions"
1207950,515137265,8/22/2019,"This house is an exceptional one! It was so clean & well set up, we had 8 guests in total & there was plenty of space for all of us. Dave & Ann gave us a lot of useful tips about the area & left a lot of extra touches in the house which made our stay very comfortable. Its also in a brilliant location, close to shops & transport making it very convenient. I would highly recommend staying here!"
1207950,522456502,9/2/2019,"Fantastic large house in a lovely safe neighbourhood. Easy walk (10mins) to a large shopping centre that has everything you need. Short walk (5mins) to local small supermarket which was surprisingly reasonably priced and stocked a huge range.  House has 4 decent size bedrooms and 3 separate sitting areas so plenty of space for a large group. House has large amount of natural light so is bright and airy and has a lovely welcoming feel to it. There is a beautiful garden and deck. My only minor issue was that there was limited hot water so with 5 ladies in a house together, it was a fight for the first shower and a constant struggle to ensure the last person had any hot water left. Dave and Ann were lovely friendly host and responded promptly to any communication.  I would definitely recommend this house. Thank you Dave and Ann for the use of your lovely home."
1207950,530766979,9/16/2019,"The house is perfectly located in a cosy and lovely part of the city. It is also very close to the luas train station and bus station which makes transportation to any part of the city very easy. It is perfectly clean, very elegantly decorated. The hosts Dave and Ann and their family are great and think of everything. We appreciated everything."
1265520,425922776,3/19/2019,"Maeve was an outstanding host and really made it a special experience for us! Her place was absolutely perfect, clean and centrally located. We loved the little historic corner. Maeve was always quick to reapond and gave us lots of great tips for our stay. We loved every minute of it and would defiantly stay again! Thanks for everything Maeve!"
1265520,437824017,4/15/2019,Maeve and Alex are very nice. It was a easy communication and my friends and I had a really good time. This is for everyone who like to visit Dublin and enjoy the nice people there
1265520,444760829,4/28/2019,"Maeve is a special person. He was always helpful and helped us whenever we asked for information and general tips about the house and about Dublin. The house is great and offers us good conditions to enjoy the whole stay in Dublin without worries. The shower is good, the beds are great. There are several buses near the house that take us to the city center in a few minutes. I really want to thank Maeve for all her attention to my whole family."
1270261,424873551,3/17/2019,"Fantastic countryside house, our room was for 3 and our dogs and it was huge. Fresh coffee settled us in and the room was warm. James and his family were very friendly. Would recommend."
1276002,425447056,3/18/2019,"Great host and nice home. Spacious and a large kitchen/patio area. Anything you would need from a kitchen was available and the house is very stylish/quaint. Only thing to keep in mind is the distance between the house and Dublin center, which is somewhat far by foot."
1276002,427984872,3/24/2019,"This is a really special place. The house is full of character, beautifully light and engaging. The location, a short walk to the Luas or a slightly longer stroll into town is perfect |(and yet it is in a really quiet street with little noise or traffic). Caroline's personal touch and guidance was 1st class (the Thai takeaway recommended is really good). My boys loved the house and felt really at home, and it was a special weekend with a big birthday for my wife. The house and Caroline's little touches of kindness made it all the more special. We would definitely recommend to others looking a great base for Dublin & would certainly stay again ourselves."

1276002,487743106,7/14/2019,"Our group enjoyed Carolines place very much! Its comfortable, colorful with a great shower and a lovely garden. We liked the neighborhood, and the walk to town was easy and interesting. Caroline was very responsive and even allowed us to check in early. Thank you, Caroline!"
1276002,499436513,7/31/2019,A pleasant and well equipped house. Good and fast communication.
1276002,518347878,8/26/2019,"Convenient location about 20 minutes from the centre of Dublin. Very quiet area with grocery shops within walking distance. We were able to have a flexible check in/check out time which was great with a toddler! Great kids area inside and outside and toys to entertain.
Very considerate host who left beers and wine for our arrival, prompt and helpful with all communication and recommendations. 
Would definitely recommend staying here, especially if young family."

1276002,546131746,10/13/2019,"A great place with a great host. Feels like staying at home. A modern property which has been furnished with style and quality. Lots of thoughtful extras such as a nespresso machine with capsules, tea, biscuits, snacks, bread, milk etc which came in handy. An excellent choice for those staying with a family as Caroline also provides a cot and loads of childrens toys! All in all a fabulous experience and we wouldnt hesitate staying here again."
1287829,443212799,4/25/2019,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Sandra's place. It is a comfortable and cosy home, lovingly decorated, with a fully equipped kitchen, a lovely sunny sitting room and a cute garden. The house is conveniently located between centre and airport, both of which are easily reachable by public transport, the bus stop being very close to the house. Furthermore, the communication with Sandra was excellent, so everything worked smoothly and we spent a great time in Dublin!"
1287829,452551889,5/13/2019,"It is a spacious accommodation with nice features such as a whirl pool, Barbecue. The location is perfect. Close to the centre but near enough to the M50 for country side sightseeing. To get to the  city I would strongly recommend the public transport. Taxi or much cheaper of course the busses. At rush hour it's the quickest way to town. By car it could take up to 90min for 7km"
1287829,467996181,6/11/2019,"Plenty of space and wonderful amenities. Sandra has thought of everything. The house is immaculate and close to everything you could need and Dublin city center was an easy 20-25 minute drive. 
The back garden is a respite at the end of the day. 
Sandra went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and made our stay in her home thoroughly enjoyable. 
I highly recommend this property!"
1287829,473333222,6/21/2019,"Sandra was a perfect host and responded, literally, within minutes to any questions we had. She checked in regularly during our 10 day stay and made herself available when we had some difficulty figuring out the water heating system. 

The house is perfectly suited for a family or group that prefers not to be directly in Dublin. It is in a local neighborhood with nearby access to stores and restaurants (try the Little Venice restaurant î yummy homemade Italian).  Even the neighbors were helpful and eagerly accepted delivery of our delayed luggage for us. 

We drove a rental car throughout our stay and easily found parking in the city but buses are within an easy walk to the house. The purpose of our trip took us to golf courses to the North so the Santry House  was located midway and allowed us to easily go either direction.  My husband even learned to master driving on the left!

The house was well stocked, very comfortable, and clean making it a true home away from homeù.  The only small problem we had was learning the trick with the twice daily water heating system but Sandra helped us to work that out. The upstairs shower has low pressure but the downstairs is great. 

We truly enjoyed our stay and give Sandra and the Santry house a heartfelt five starsù!!!"
1287829,480686795,7/3/2019,Thanks for quick responsiveness Sandra!! Great location - walking distance to bus stop.... near by mall ... bright lovely house.
1287829,537936023,9/29/2019,"We (three colleagues) being on a business trip to Dublin combining it with two free days to walk around were more than happy with Sandra's place: beginning from the location and ending with check out experiences.

- Booking was seamless, Sandra instantly answered all the questions and supported when I had a pending payment issue with my bank;

- Check-in instructions made our first day as smooth as possible - as if we would have own key to enter own house.

- The house itself is very cozy, not big but more than enough for three people - you will find everything needed - literally everything for your everyday life; the kitchen is well equipped so it was a pleasure to cook there breakfasts and a couple of dinners - big dining table will easily accommodate up to 6 people; there are washrooms on the ground- and first floor; bedrooms are warm and cozy - so it's value for money paid for sure.

Even though Sandra's house is located in quiet residential area (the fact we really enjoyed after noisy Dublin downtown) you can find everything you need in 10 - 15 min walking distance: big shopping center Omni, small Takeaway shops (great pizza btw) just opposite the street, 3-5 min walk to the bus stop to get to the city center (30 min by bus as Dublin streets are not too spacious to accommodate its traffic) or just take a taxi and for 20 EUR and in 20 Min you will be in the city center.

I would really recommend Sandra's place for business or family travelers.

Sandra, once again - thank you!"
1287829,544497386,10/10/2019,"Sandra was such a thoughtful host, and even accommodated our early check in ... was so appreciated after a long night of travelling. She was also  quick with helpful  responses  to any inquiries. Her clean home was just like described and in pictures posted.  We were not disappointed at the accommodations that added to the Irish experience."
1287829,552325681,10/21/2019,This home is in a fantastic location for getting into Dublin and to the airport.  Bright and sunny home with a nice garden.  Very quiet place to stay.  We enjoyed it very much.
1289697,495678697,7/26/2019,"The house and location is great.  It is a relatively easy bus ride to the centre or a short drive.  The area is quiet and please to walk around.

It is also easy to leave the city or travel around to visit other areas; we went to Glendalough, Howth and Newgrange and Knowth whilst there.

John and Diana were great hosts and very responsive to any enquiries.


Id recommend them.

The house is clean, modern in its finishing and very user friendly in layout. Beautiful garden very well taken care of as well. The house instruction guide left for us was short, simple and very easy to understand. We had our 10 month old cocker spaniel with us and had great walks down by the Dodder river and into Bushy Park. Really peaceful and quiet location aswell. It's the perfect place for a peaceful quiet break away but still within close proximity to Dublin city to explore. John & Diana were perfect hosts, leaving us food and supplies on our arrival so we could settle in without having to go straight back out searching for supplies. We highly recommend John & Diana's place and hope they can accommodate us again on our next visit."
1289697,559578873,11/4/2019,"Our family highly recommend John and Dianas lovely home. We were so comfortable there, and so appreciated their thoughtfulness and care for us during our stay. We arrived exhausted from a trans Atlantic flight to find the ingredients for a lovely Irish breakfast waiting for us. They checked in with us to be sure everything was OK, and made sure we had everything we needed. They are amazing hosts!
The kids loved their garden."
1290506,463523748,6/3/2019,"Bernadine is very conscientious and wants her guests to have a great experience at her home. I did!  

I was able to relax after two months of moving from place to place. 

The location was perfect for me. The bus downtown is 15-20 minutes. The walk to the bus stop is maybe 5 minutes. Its super easy to find your way. 

The house is also about 20-30 minutes to the airport (non-rush hour). Bernadine ordered my taxi, which was very helpful and stress free. 

The neighborhood is quiet and relaxing. Bs home is lovely. Archie, the dog, is adorable and well-trained. I had a lot of great conversations with B and her husband. 

I definitely recommend staying here. If I return to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again."

Nice room and a good sleep. After that, I was driven to the train station to continue my travel. What to say? Just, thank you...."

1315528,494525404,7/24/2019,"Any questions you have and the country,  they are more than willing to answer. They are very eager to help accommodate you as best as possible and they are very relaxed people. The place itself is very comfortable, clean, and has a home like warmth to it."
1315528,495719236,7/26/2019,Great room in a nice neighborhood close to the airport.

1315528,499444662,7/31/2019,"Cannot recommend this place enough for travellers, pre or post-airport arrival, airport staff etc. Anything! They're super friendly, super helpful about the local area and their welcome and hospitality was second to none! Would highly recommend for any purpose."
1315528,507220008,8/11/2019,"Very quaint, comfy place. Des & Sinead were very friendly, communicative and helpful. They offered tea upon arrival, offered airport pickup/drop off and even gave recommendations of what to see and do in Ireland. Very hospitable! The bedroom was clean and comfortable. Also they put a sealed bottle of water in the bedroom with glasses to have before bedtime. Very sweet touch and they also offer a light breakfast in the morning, as well as accommodating for any diet or health restrictions. Really wonderful stay! Highly suggest to anyone."
1315528,510712535,8/16/2019,"Des and Sinead are two very wonderful people, and they are sure to make your trip even better than you thought it would be. From the moment I walked in the door my experience was fantastic. Their place was immaculate and decorated well, and the two are extremely helpful, kind and respectful. They've got great recommendations from transportation to locations, and, like it says on the listing, they'll even pick you up from the airport. My room was a big and very comfortable space. If I could give them more than five stars I would. I greatly recommend staying here if you're considering it."
1315528,515815807,8/23/2019,Des and Sinead went above and beyond to ensure my husband and I had a great trip to Ireland! They are not only amazing hosts they are also extremely knowledgeable about the area and things to do! They literally thought of everything (like a juice pack when they knew we would be out using our phones all day  -which was a total life saver). Breakfast was always delicious! Being picked up at the airport was such a huge plus (especially when jet lagged!). We were able to fit so much in to a relatively short trip and staying with them made our stay that much better. We will definitely be recommending them to our friends and family and plan to stay with them again ourselves as well. Five stars!
1315528,521657286,9/1/2019,"I was so lucky to stay at Sinead and Des' home last weekend. You feel like you are visiting a family. Clean room, comfortable bed, amazing breakfast and great hospitality. Playground just in front of the house, so very practical if u stay with kids. Direct bus to city centre and airport is 5-10min by car which is very convenient. Both hosts are very helpful with any tips/questions you may have.  Highly recommend and would definitely stay again. Merci bcp!"
1315528,523273983,9/3/2019,"Thank you so much! From the moment I arrived they were accommodating and warm. They invited me to eat dinner with them and told me about Ireland. They even set up a taxi for me to take to the airport in the morning.

Very clean, cute and neat. Felt like I was at home. Very sweet people with the experience of top notch hospitality!"

1315528,528142011,9/12/2019,"Des and Sinead showed us outstanding hospitality and service above and beyond what was expected. Everything from showing us to the nearest pub, giving us advise on what to see in Dublin and picking us up/ dropping us off at the airport made our short stay in Dublin a real joy! Thank you"

Would strongly recommend. Thank you again"

1315528,536801945,9/27/2019,"Des & Sinead's place was fantastic! Very clean and stylish place with everything you need. In a great location, right next to the airport. Would definitely stay here again! They went above and beyond on with there hospitality. They picked me up from the airport and dropped me off at the bus stop. Sinead made a delicious breakfast of eggs and toast for myself and several of the other guests. Can't recommend this place enough."
1315528,537192446,9/28/2019,"Very clean, comfortable, and hospitable, including a terrific breakfast and just minutes from the airport!"
1315528,541570164,10/5/2019,"We had a great time with Des and Sinead and wish we had stayed with them longer. Our last night in Dublin turned out to be rather special thanks to them and their adorable dogs. Sinead coordinated our arrival well and very kindly picked us up from the bus stop and showed us the way to come back later. 

The place is just a 5-7 minute cab ride (costs around 12-15‚Ç¨) from the airport, so very convenient as a base if you're flying in or out of Dublin. It is also a 30-minute ride from the city centre with a direct bus that stops very close (5-8 minute walk) to their place.
The room was very comfortable with two large beds and cosy interiors. The ensuite bathroom was also spacious and tidy. There is quite a spread for breakfast though we didn't have time as we had an early flight. Overall, our stay was very comfortable and we'd surely stay with them if we're ever in Dublin again :) 

Des and Sinead were so much fun and we had a great time chatting with them and a couple of guests over dinner and drinks. So glad to have met them!"
1315528,546179362,10/13/2019,Des & Sinead are everything Airbnb is about.  They are warm and friendly. Anywhere they are hosting is exactly where you want to stay!

1332458,434039443,4/7/2019,"Nicole was an amazing host and has a truly unique and interesting home. Her description of the home is completely accurate, it is an old historic home but you can tell she has lovingly put a ton of work into its upkeep and restoring it for modern use. The kitchen and living room areas are open and well decorated. They have all of the essentials. The bedrooms have plenty of beds to accommodate large groups and the main bathroom is really cool. 

Nicole herself was a great host, she communicated very well and responded quickly. She accommodated our groups early arrival by meeting us before normal check in time (we booked an extra night prior to ensure it would be ready) which was greatly appreciated! She allowed us to store our luggage on the way out as well as some people had late flights.

The home is in a great location with the Jameson distillery so close and nice cafes and bars on Smithfield square. We walked to Temple Bar every night and it was about 15-20 min walk. Uber and taxis were also available. 

This home is a great option for a large group looking to have a great time in Dublin!"
1332458,435358557,4/10/2019,"Fantastic host, great location and a fantastic house for student groups like ours!"
1332458,437854259,4/15/2019,"Once you know this is a party place and thats what you want, youll love this incredible, eccentrically decorated place. The location is a great place to be in the city, away from most of the tourists, but with a lot going on."
1332458,447299771,5/3/2019,"A really very old historic house with all the advantages and disadvantages that are due to the age.  
For what we wanted to do with our ""8 Man Tour"" ok (visit as many pubs as possible).  
The location of the house is perfect, in 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar, 20 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse only 3 minutes to the Jameson distillery.  
Nicole is a good hostess, always available and very uncomplicated.  

We had a good time in Dublin.  Slainte"
1332458,453219582,5/15/2019,"The location is fantastic, and the description of the home is accurate - read thoroughly to see if it's a fit for your group."
1332458,455226813,5/19/2019,A well located very quirky house for large groups with a range of sleeping options and fabulous communal space. Nicole is a relaxed welcoming host
1332458,460500416,5/29/2019,A great space for our family! Historic charm and lots of rooms to spread out! Very clean and a great (Website hidden by Airbnb) need to use our rental car as so many sites and pubs were nearby or only a quick bus/Dart/taxi ride away!
1332458,461277476,5/31/2019,"The hosts description of the property is very accurate. The house is spacious and quirky with lots of character, the beds are comfy, great location and excellent value."
1332458,462748727,6/2/2019,"Thank you so much for having us stay, we all really enjoyed our stay! 

I really appreciated everything you helped us out with when it went wrong. You was so helpful"
1332458,464775170,6/6/2019,"Nicole was a great hostess and provided detailed and timely communication. The house is well located and in easy access to much of Dublin. However, I must be honest in my overall review. Upon reading the description of the house, I was intrigued at the notion of a historic home and didnt blink an eye when learning about it being restored. It did not bother me that it was imperfect and that the layout included three flights of stairs, an unconventional bathroom, and multiple beds in one or more rooms. I was prepared and excited for quirky. I was not prepared for the condition of the home in terms of smell, paint, floor coverings, and carpet. While we were there, the entry and stairwell leading to the second floor had such a strong odor that we had to contact Nicole. It smelled horribly of mildew and decay. She came to clean, but the smell returned by the next morning. There was physical evidence of rodents in the home, and the smell of mildew wore on many of the nine of us in the home. The conditions of the walls were in need of repair. The carpet leading up the stairs was very, very unclean. The unconventional bathroom layout did cause some stress in terms of working around 9 guests and their bathroom needs. This house has great potential. It will be great one day. But, in the meantime, its important for future guests to truly understand that the underlying issues are more than just cosmetic. The environmental issues with mold, dust, decay, and so forth are definitely unhealthy and of concern."
1332458,468433476,6/12/2019,This place was located close to Jamesons distillery and was within walking distance to most things in Dublin.  Overall a good place to stay for a big family.
1332458,471859002,6/18/2019,"This place is hard to encapsulate in a review. Staying here is an experience, lots of space and great location but it is one of the oldest houses in Dublin so it has its quirks. meeting the host and hearing her stories were an integral part of the adventure."
1332458,473253536,6/21/2019,"Extremely reliable, friendly and understanding."
1332458,474421252,6/23/2019,Wouldnt stay there again. Over priced and dirty. Seemed a nice lady but ruined my birthday as all friends were so dissatisfied
1332458,481620052,7/5/2019,"This house was conveniently located near restaurants, grocery store and the train.  Made it easy to see Dublin on foot or take transportation if you want to."
1332458,484223662,7/8/2019,"We stayed in this property at the beginning of July for 3 nights to celebrate an upcoming wedding.  This property should be avoided at all costs,  if you are expecting it to look anything like the photos you will be greatly disappointed.
Every part of the property has issues which are not just down to the age of the property and a need of paint as the host would have you believe.
The property has many health and safety issues starting with the stench as you enter the building.  This come from the damp, mould and mildew that is evident on every floor.  The stench is a mixture of damp, mould and filth and permeates to every floor.  We had to buy scented candles to try and mask the stench.   During our stay the few windows that could be opened led to a plague of flies entering the property, they came from the garden area that could not be accessed.
Other safety issues are the electrics, there are broken sockets and light fittings and dubious wiring. There are broken floorboards, unsafe bannisters, raised threshold with raised screws.  Wall coverings are held together with masking tape and plaster to the walls with baton.  
The property looks like it should be condemned and locals told us it was supposed to be.  No one in the local area could believe it was being rented through Airbnb and they warned us to keep our bags and belongings with us as we were not safe.
We were a group of 14 women of various ages and not one of us had ever experienced staying in such squalor.
The property made our trip memorable for all the wrong reasons."
1332458,488584277,7/15/2019,"Very helpful owner, good communication and very flexible and accommodating. As mentioned by others, floors and carpets very unclean. Lots of space for a big group."
1332458,493874719,7/23/2019,The home is definitely in a great location putting you close to many attractions and points of interest and Nicole is an extremely helpful and friendly host.  The 12 of us all had a place to sleep for the night which is all we really required.  It has great potential for being a real destination house but currently there is still room for improvement.
1332458,495701189,7/26/2019,Nicoles place was great for what we needed.  Communication with Nicole was quick and always helpful.  Nicole also makes terrific recommendations for the area.
1332458,497284389,7/28/2019,"We stayed at this property for a hen weekend in July. I have stayed in many airbnbs over the years and have only had positive things to say about my experiences. But I cannot find anything good to say about this house. 
As per the description of this property we were expecting the house to be a little rough around the edges due to its age but what we found at the property was far from a few rough edges. Every part of this property had issues. Starting with the smell as you enter the building. It was clear that none of the beds had been changed with some of the bedding noticeably dirty and covered in hair. Immediately on our arrival we had to find clean bedding and change them ourselves. There were flies throughout the house, the bathrooms were visibly dirty, the showers had grime around the tray and the carpets didnt appear to have been hoovered for some time. This is not what we had expected, not least considering the exorbitant cleaning fees. 
In addition, there were multiple health and safety issues on this property. The windows had to be propped open with sticks of wood to keep them up, and when we did manage to open them, they were dirty and falling apart from the damp. Other safety issues, noticed and pointed out to us by the fire service were the electrics, including broken sockets and light fittings and unsafe wiring. The fire service were shocked at the number of safety issues in the property, nor could they believe that the property was being rented out as an Airbnb.
There were broken floorboards, unsafe bannisters and exposed screws. There was little thought to fire safety; over the four floors, there was just one fire escape through the main entrance with the second door to the back garden bolted shut.
On the second night of our stay, a water pipe burst in the kitchen and we were forced to evacuate by the fire service when we were informed the house was unsafe to stay in. We were told that the key issue was not the flooding from the burst waterpipe but the state of the electrics in the property that made the flooding so dangerous. If we had realised the extent of the health and safety issues at this property, we would not have booked. 
We were a group of 16 ladies of various ages, two of which are pregnant. We had nowhere to go on Saturday. We had to walk half an hour to a 24-hour McDonalds as this was the only place open and we were informed the safest place for us to go. We decided to travel to the airport at 3am and were stuck there for hours with no sleep. Nicole offered us no support during this ordeal, and only questioned why we had phoned the fire service!
Staying here ruined the entire weekend and the stress and risk this stay put us all in was completely unacceptable. We are currently pursuing a full refund for this stay and would warn anyone thinking about booking here to AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1332458,509277627,8/14/2019,"Our group of 13 thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Nicoles beautiful home. This house was huge and in a perfect location. Check-in was delayed a few hours but that was all for good reasons (brand new flooring throughout the home!) Note that there is no washing machine in the house as noted in the listing. We had piping hot water & with 13 people thats hard to do! All in all, we would definitely recommend this home!"
1332458,510470952,8/16/2019,Cant thank Nicole enough for our overnight in Dublin! Very difficult to find a place to host such a big group who are allowed to be loud! One of the best nights in a long time. The bath was a highlight 
1332458,512316505,8/18/2019,"Just back from a fab weekend celebrating my hen party. This house is unreal- so quirky and different. I was worried it might not be to everyones taste because of its age but I couldnt have been more wrong. The whole group of 12 loved it. The communal area was perfect for socialising and everyone said how homely it felt. The main bathroom really is an amazing feature. Nicole was so friendly and check in was smooth and easy. Her passion for the local area is incredible and she gave us some great tips about where to go/eat etc. The fresh flowers were an added bonus to make us feel welcome. Thank you Nicole, we will be back!! Danielle"
1332458,519869226,8/29/2019,Nicole's place was a great central location for our group to explore Dublin.  The kitchen  was well equipped for cooking some of our meals.  Nicole has a passion for this historic building.  She has taken great pride in making it as modern as she is allowed to do.   There are a lot of steps but our group is pretty active so  not a problem for us.  We thought that only having two bathrooms would be a problem but we managed just fine.  There is lots of hot water.  Nicole is a very welcoming host and had lots of suggestions.  She was quick to respond before our stay and during it.  Would stay here again.
1332458,521894271,9/1/2019,"This house is great for a large group, Nicole was very informative and friendly upon arrival. She gave us loads of great tips and recommendations. We had such a fun stay here and would definitely come again!"

1332458,528494961,9/13/2019,"THis was a house with a unique history. Since it is older,  there were areas of the home that had a musty smell (that became challenging for 2 of us with allergies). Despite its age, the home has a lot of character and Nicole is investing her time and money into renovating it. For us it wasnt in a neighborhood conducive to us-we like to walk wherever we can and we didnt feel safe if we planned to walk here individually or even in pairs (there were 6 of us and we didnt feel safe once it got dark)"
1332458,529900921,9/15/2019,"Nicole was very friendly. She met us nearby the accommodation and pointed out local favourite places as we made our way to the house. So polite and welcoming. Big thanks to Nicole. Plenty of room in the house for the 11 guests.
Thank you xx"
1332458,535899255,9/25/2019,"Amazing place at the city centre. And highly cost efficient too. You can visit the major places within city such as museums, library etc by using the public transport and it is very nearby.

Totally a very comfortable and economic stay.. Enjoyed it very much"

1332458,538059838,9/29/2019,"Nicole was an absolutely amazing host. I organised a hen weekend for my sister, there were 15 of us and each of us were blown away with Nicole and her amazing house. 

The house itself was spotless. The rooms decorated lovely and the property has such character. Very well located - near a Lidl and a Health Food Shop with traditional Irish pubs best by we couldnt have asked for a better place to stay. 

Nicole is honest in that the house is old so there are some things that could be changed but why would you want to when a house has such amazing character? 

Nicole was very accommodating and helpful providing us with tips and recommendations and a thorough tour of the house. 

Thanks again Nicole, your house is wonderful and so are you!!"
1332458,542411016,10/6/2019,"Nicole was an excellent host. Communications were quick and helpful and she was very flexible with our check in timings.

1332458,544096270,10/9/2019,"The host met us outside and was VERY informative! The historic house was cool. As stated in the discription its an old house so some things are a bit weathered, but it was a neat place to stay, and the renovations were cools Great location!"

1341478,475492632,6/24/2019,The communication with Eddie is very friendly and fast. The apartment is very charming and the location is great. The bus stations are in walking distance and walking into the city is also possible. I guess the house is very old and the walls were not very think. We could hear every step the people upstairs were taking. But I would still recommend Eddies apartment to everybody who is enjoying Dublin.
1341478,479673411,7/1/2019,"We had a very enjoyable stay at Eddie's apartment. He was very friendly and helped us a lot for example for some touristic informations. He also hired a taxi for us if it was necessary.
Just be careful with the linked locality on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. At first it linked us to an address about 200 meters away from Eddie's apartment. In the 2nd try it worked... Maybe it's fixed now.

1345435,538882239,9/30/2019,"I have spent the summer with my girlfriend in Conor's house when I was working in Dublin. I would recommend the place to everyone - from a student looking for a longer stay to a couple visiting Dublin for a weekend. The location is lovely and a walking distance from the city centre.
Conor is a great host - he always responded immediately to text messages, he knows all about Dublin and can share lots of local tips and places to visit, depending on what you're most interested in."
1345435,557199611,10/31/2019,My stay at Conor's wonderful home in Portobello was better than I could have hoped for. The proximity to the city centre was fantastic and I loved walking around the neighbourhood and along the Grand Canal. Conor was a terrific host and worked hard to ensure that I was able to make the most of my stay. I would certainly choose to stay there again given the chance. Highly recommended.
1345435,565949792,11/18/2019,"The house was very convenient and in a great location, with a full kitchen and a pretty nice collection of dvds. It was a bit drafty so might be better for the summer months rather than winter."
1364560,422892717,3/12/2019,"Lovely home, very welcoming and cosy! The room has everything you need and the breakfast in the morning is perfect to get you started for the day. Steve and Ayelet provided us with allot of local tips. The ones we tried out were great. Thanks for the hospitality!"
1364560,427941985,3/24/2019,The location and the house are great. The hosts are nice and give great travelling tips.
1364560,431609390,4/1/2019,"My sister and I had a lovely couple of days staying in Steve and Ayelet's very cool and creative home. They put together several guides/recommendations which were so useful, and which we followed for most of our trip. The breakfasts were exactly what we needed and a nice touch. Comfy bed, good amenities and very helpful hosts. Thanks Ayelet and Steve!"
1364560,434734319,4/8/2019,"I would have given Ayelet and Steve 10 stars, however they only allow 5. 
Needless to say, we HIGHLY recommend staying here. 

To start, Ayelet and Steve are the definition of the perfect hosts. They spent time with my boyfriend and I on our first night, exchanging stories/ casual conversation, as well as giving us great suggestions for food/ fun in Dublin and all over Ireland. They made us feel right at home. Honestly it felt as though we had known them forever. 

Their home is super cozy, extremely clean and very accommodating to all of your needs. Their home is full of amazing art work that they have collected as well as original pieces made my Ayelet, herself. 

Their home is in a prime location. Youre able to walk a short, yet scenic distance to Guinness brewery and center city, Dublin. The walk is full of the most friendly locals and welcoming pubs. 

Again, we highly recommend staying with these wonderful people to anyone looking for a quiet get away to one of Irelands beautiful cities. 

Thank you again Ayelet and Steve, looking forward to building our friendship and staying in touch! :)"
1364560,437807087,4/15/2019,"For those of you looking to meet a real Irish artist, Ayelets the person you want to stay with! The house is filled with her artwork, along with custom art by her family and friends, from paintings to stained glass. Its like staying in a gallery. Shes very thoughtful and nice to speak to. (We never met Steve but we assume hes nice as well.)

The house is spotless and the simple breakfast was much appreciated. We wouldnt recommend this house to anyone who cant handle narrow stairs (the room is on the second floor) or who want to stay super close to Temple Bar (the house is near Coombe Womens Hospital). Also, for those of you from more tropical climates, Id recommend that you bring an extra layer in case youre not used to the insulation in old houses. Otherwise, I would recommend this to mature, clean, respectful travellers who want to stay in a quiet residential area."
1364560,454971361,5/19/2019,"We had a very nice stay, the location is well communicated to everywhere we wanted to go and Steve & Aylet  made us feel like being in a friend's house,and gave us tips  for local places & pubs."
1364560,459323316,5/27/2019,"Ayelet and Steve are wonderful hosts, who are open to providing you with any tips you may need. Not only that, but their house is adorable, and the morning breakfast they provide is a great way to start your day!"
1364560,466418958,6/9/2019,"Exactly as described and pictured,  perfect for a short break in Dublin. Would highly recommend"
1364560,471411741,6/17/2019,"Ayelet and Steve have a lovely house with fascinating artwork on the walls.  The Maryland area the house is in doesn't look great, but I decided to solve that problem by always getting a late-night taxi home.  I was perfectly happy to walk the 7 mins to the tram during the daylight, but at night I used the MyTaxi app to be delivered straight to the door (Uber doesn't exist in Dublin).  It was usually under ‚Ç¨10 to travel from Dublin's Temple Bar area to the house.
The bedrooms are upstairs but the bathroom is downstairs.
Cereal, coffee and wonderful Irish soda bread was always laid out neatly for me to serve myself in the mornings."
1364560,474428939,6/23/2019,Really great hosts in a lovely quirky house. Location very close to public transport and a super comfy bed.
1364560,482423345,7/6/2019,"Ayelet and Steve's place is the most unique and stylish Airbnb I have ever encountered. It's fully of quirky art and unique touches. Ayelet and Steve are both very friendly and were helpful in answering any questions we had. A simple breakfast was provided. While the house is not super close to downtown, there are bus and tram stops close by. Walking downtown will take about half an hour. We thought the neighborhood was pretty nice although some of our cab drivers mentioned it was a bit 'shady.' I get the sense that it's an area that has gentrified in recent years. Regardless, we always felt safe walking around. Two things to be aware of at the home would be the creaky staircase right outside the bedroom door by the head of the bed (not ideal for light sleepers!) and there is only one bathroom in the house, and it's on the ground floor level. We had a great stay and will never forget this amazing house."
1364560,484678846,7/9/2019,"Ayelet and Steve are great host. They are very friendly and they told us a lot of tips for the trip. The room is clean and there are many attractive art works. If I come back to Ireland, I definitely choose here again."
1364560,513198564,8/19/2019,"Very nice, clean, Ayelet & Steve are welcoming and really committed to helping you have the best experience in Dublin!"
1364560,517129519,8/25/2019,"Ayelet and Steve are fantastic hosts. Easy to communicate with, and all of the photos of the space are accurate. They are there to help by answering any questions you have, and they are absolutely lovely to talk to. A perfect example of true Irish hospitality. They are fantastic, I cant recommend this place enough!"
1364560,522548242,9/2/2019,"First at all, Ayelet and Steve are really nice people, really open mind, they will give you great recommendations about the city, and theyre house is really pretty and is near to city center, just like 20 min walking and so close to the bus lines, everything so clean and the bedroom was comfortable. 100% recommendable."
1364560,530708354,9/16/2019,"Steve and Ayelet are very kind, hospitable and friendly. They react very quickly to every need you may have, they also provide you suggestions and advices to enjoy your stay. The house is pretty but suitable for a short stay. Maybe the house rules are a little bit rigid."
1364560,534820852,9/23/2019,It was a pleasure to stay in Ayelet and Steves home. It was clean and tidy. Ayelet gave us a warm welcome. The breakfast was nice. We recommend this place to others.
1364560,538028303,9/29/2019,Ayelet is incredibly friendly and knowledgable about Dublin. She is happy to share tips and she makes you feel very comfortable. The house itself is lovely and perfect for 1 or 2 nights. To enter the bathroom you have to go via the living room and kitchen and the guests bedroom is right next door to the hosts bedroom so its not as private for a longer stay. The breakfast was also very nice! Thank you for the hospitality!
1364560,566036954,11/18/2019,"My wife, Sierra, and I loved staying with Ayelet and Steve. Ayelet is a talented and thoughtful artist who has great tips for enjoying the best of Dublin. Steve is a warm-hearted and friendly host who made being in the home very comfortable. Would recommend as an AirBnB spot."
1407832,441939909,4/22/2019,"What a great stay. Therese and Rory are such great hosts.  Their home is beautiful,  well appointed,  spacious and very central . We highly recommend staying here!"
1407832,483310138,7/7/2019,"Therese's home is a great spot for a family vacation! The home is very comfortable and has multiple living spaces, so you feel as though you can spread out and relax. We really enjoyed the garden, with the trampoline, gas grill, outdoor table, and fish pond. The power shower in the master bathroom is very refreshing and there is plenty of room to park out front. They have changed the bedroom configurations a bit, so three bedrooms now have larger beds and one bedroom has a child-sized bed. The town of Blackrock is not even a 10 minute walk, with lots of great restaurants and shops. The house is also very close to the water, which also made for great walks. 

Our daughter really was the perfect age for this house, at 19 months and very mobile. There are two open steps between the kitchen and living room and another step off the outdoor patio into the yard. She was just able to navigate them safely, though younger walkers might struggle. We also had to keep our daughter close, as we couldn't figure out how to close/lock the doors between the living room, kitchen, and hallway, which led to the stairs to the second floor. 

Therese and her family were very accommodating and responsive and we would absolutely stay at their house again!"
1407832,503085948,8/5/2019,"We were 2 families staying for 10 days in July , the location is ideal for the nearby DART station and buses , Seapoint beach , Dun Laoghaire town and harbour and some great pubs and eateries in nearby Blackrock village  
The house is ultra modern and very spacious with plenty of room for 2 families (2 children each) , there is off street parking and a back garden that was great for outside dining and the children enjoyed the trampoline.
Therese made us feel right at home and there were plenty of initial supplies before we had a shop  , plenty of towels and great facilities for washing and drying.
We would highly recommend."
1407832,505424022,8/9/2019,"Therese is a great host and communication is excellent.  We hired a car and the house is about half an hour's drive from the centre of Dublin, there is parking for 2 cars in front of the house, behind an electric gate.  There are train stations at Blackrock and Seapoint, both about 10 minutes walk away.  

The house is spacious and comfortable and is a real 'home from home'.  There is a big kitchen and 'garden room' leading out into the garden which has seating and a gas barbecue.  We loved spending time relaxing in this room.

The house has everything you need, including a well stocked fridge!  Such an advantage when you're flying in and obviously limited with what you can bring with you.  There is a supermarket about 15 minutes walk away when you need to stock up.

Seapoint is about 15 minutes walk away, it's obviously a very popular place for swimming, although we just stuck to paddling!  Of course there are loads of places to visit in and around Dublin, and Therese's house is a great base, having the advantage of being close to the coast and the city.  We definitely recommend a stay here!"
1407832,514010537,8/20/2019,Great location near the DART station; ideal for a family;
1411019,418477312,3/2/2019,great experience. would stay again!!
1411019,421941241,3/10/2019,"Sam was a really friendly and welcoming host who made sure that everything we needed was readily available for us during our stay. He was really quick to respond to any queries that we had and we felt completely at home in his apartment in Dublin. The space was stylish and clean, and we loved the 3 cats who made the place feel like a home away from home. The location was also perfect! I would recommend Sams place to anyone travelling in Dublin!"
1411019,422852526,3/12/2019,"Sam was an amazing host, communicated with us super efficiently and quickly before arriving to his place. The only downside of his beautiful penthouse apt is that it was sometimes hard for us to leave because of his incredible sweetheart and smart cats. My husband also learnt that he wish to have one of Sam's cat kind for himself in the future. Thanks Sam for inspiring us growing our family! All the best, Sam!"
1411019,424191337,3/16/2019,"Great location! Short walk to just about everything.   Nice sunlight room, a little snug. Lots of stairs up to the unit, so keep this in mind when packing. Sam was quick to respond & getting checked in/out was very easy. 2 super cute cats, but we didn't see to much of them."
1411019,425469285,3/18/2019,"Sams place is perfect for a stay in Dublin. Sam is welcoming, kind and meticulously thorough with check in procedure and providing a comfortable stay. We were able to cook, shower, do our laundry and use his apartment as if it was our own. He does have three cats who mind their own business and we loved them. The room is comfortable, bed is very nice and we all-around recommend Sams place. And it is basically on Temple Bar, couldnt ask for more."
1411019,426229857,3/20/2019,"An excellent location! Sam is a considerate host and the space is lovely and private. Do be prepared to walk up 81 steps, but it's well worth the climb!"
1411019,427925780,3/24/2019,Amazing location
1411019,429253688,3/27/2019,This place had the perfect location! We were a short walk from city centre and Sam provided a great list of recommendations for places to go during our short visit.
1411019,435443232,4/10/2019,"Although we could not meet Sam and Abdullah personally, we enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment is perfectly centrally located in the heart of Dublin and is only a short walk from the temple bar and other attractions. The apartment is very clean the entry and exit procedure is very simple and I would recommend this apartment to anyone. 
Thank you for the nice time and see you soon 
Deniz"
1411019,436504094,4/13/2019,"Sams apartment is perfect for your stay in Dublin. Very centrally located with food and bars near by and easy access to public transportation! 
Sam makes you feel at home and provides privacy even while being in another persons home. 
Hes a lovely host and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone!"
1411019,440934878,4/21/2019,The location of Sam's apartment is very conducive to setting off on foot to explore the Dublin City. Sam was very good at responding to questions and was quite good at offering local/insider tips to the city.
1411019,444600974,4/28/2019,Great space and fantastic location
1411019,450040552,5/8/2019,Sams place was my last place my niece stayed at on our holiday in Europe. The cats are so cute and incredibly friendly. Sam greeted us at the apartment with a huge smile and great music. He provided a list of places to see and eat that were close by and hes tried. When I return to Dublin I will definitely stay here Again!
1411019,452878503,5/14/2019,Perfect location for exploring the city and Sam even have great travel tips for our next destination as well. Had a lovely time in Dublin
1411019,453629946,5/16/2019,"Had a perfect stay at Sams flat - its confortable, well located, you have all the privacy you need but the hosts are lovely and that includes 3 beautiful cats which are a pleasure and dont bother you at all. You cant really find many places which offer better value for money in Dublin - highly recommend it!"
1411019,454499229,5/18/2019,Amazing location close to everything you need! Easy check in! And Sam was great at communicating and accommodating to us dropping off our bags early. Sam also has three super friendly cats! Was great to be welcomed by them. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go!
1411019,456358393,5/21/2019,"Sam's was a perfect spot for us to stay in Dublin:: walking distance from the main attractions and in a quiet, rooftop apartment.  The check-in process was very clear and helpful, and it was super handy to have the building laundromat available to use, as we like to travel with only a few clothes and wash them as we go!  We do wish there had been a way to lock the apartment from when we left--he keeps the door open (we could lock the deadbolt when we were there, but did not have a key to lock it when we were out).  However, it was on the top floor of a building that felt safe and secure in general.  All the plants and sweet cats made us feel right at home.  It would have been nice to know the cats come and go through the cat door though, before we panicked thinking we had lost them while Sam was away!"
1411019,465823962,6/8/2019,My sister and I stayed at Sams apartment in early June 2019 and we had a great time. The apartment was very clean and had a great location. We were able to easily walk to many big attractions from the apartment and theres lots of great food options within a 10 minute walk of the place. Sam also provided a few adaptors which was great because we had brought different adaptors for the rest of our trip. There were three cats that stayed in the living room area and they were all very friendly and cute! I would recommend Sams apartment to anyone traveling to Dublin.
1411019,467477655,6/10/2019,This is more than you can see and greater than you can imagine. Sam is an amazing host in every sense of the meaning. The accommodations are clean and inviting with a sense of a welcoming warmth. I give Sam 35 stars . I look forward to returning.
1411019,468299263,6/12/2019,"Sam was an amazing host. I'm just sorry that my mom and I were there for such a short time that we didn't get the chance to chat with Sam more. Plus the location could be beat. Word of caution, there are 7 flights of stairs to get up but Sam was great and brought our luggage down for us when we were leaving."
1411019,469200766,6/14/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sam's. Although we never met him (our paths just didn't cross!) he provided loads of information on the area, and we felt extremely welcome in his home. His cats were amazing, and we could really relax in his apartment. 

He was extremely responsive and kind to us - thanks so much Sam!

The only qualm we had was the cleanliness of the apartment. It was generally not as clean as I would have wanted - the kitchen could have done with a bit of a sprucing up. Also, when we arrived (while I think Sam was probably at work), our room wasn't turned over. The sheets weren't changed, and there was rubbish in the room. We should probably have said something earlier - but, the total Brits that we were, we didn't say anything, and Sam unfortunately didn't realise until the next day. Sam was lovely enough to provide a cleaning and service refund, which was not expected at all! So if there's a problem, Sam will 100% solve it - just let him know as soon as it occurs! 

Thanks Sam, for a wonderful stay."
1411019,471253355,6/17/2019,We felt instantly welcome at Sams amazing flat. It was decorated beautifully with all the plants and the terrace was fantastic. We would definitely book again
1411019,474586070,6/23/2019,"Do not be fooled by the miss leading photos of a clean and fresh smelling apartment. 
The terrace on my arrival couldnt be more polar opposite to the one listed. When you walk into the flat the first thing that hits you is the smell of the cats and their food. 
Due to reasons I wish to not post on here, I had to book us into a hotel which has left a massive black cloud on what should have been a nice birthday trip. When confronting Sam with this issue he was unwilling to resolve and just pointed me in the direction of Airbnb knowing full well the final say is had by himself.

All in all wouldnt advise this Double room in a penthouse flatù to anyone, much better off in a hotel in Temple Bar, unless of course youre going just for the catsù which apparently is a thing."
1411019,477421095,6/28/2019,"Things Sams add fails to mention:

(1) the bed youll be sleeping is is the most comfortable bed in the world and you wont want to visit the rest that Dublin has to offer because youll be far too comfortable in the bed. 

(2) Sams apartment is incredibly close and easy walking distance to nearly everything you can imagine. 

(3) Sam is an incredible host, friendly, and sociable. 

(4) the apartment is clean and quiet."
1411019,480317029,7/2/2019,"Appartment was the same as described. We didn't have any issues with the cats. 
Place was very close to many restaurants and attractions"
1411019,483168753,7/7/2019,"The 80+ step spiraling staircase leads you to a beautiful view of the Dublin skyline.  Being 3 blocks from anything you could want is ideal, as well as having such an accommodating host with 3 adorable cats.  Top-notch experience!"
1411019,489806656,7/17/2019,This is the most conveniently located apartment you're going to find!
1411019,490955978,7/19/2019,"The listing is accurate and the location is great. We never got a chance to meet Sam, so it felt like we had the entire place to ourselves."
1411019,496280552,7/27/2019,"Lovely place in a super central location. Enjoyed the company of the cats and plants. Sam is a very helpful and nice host, definitely recommend this place."
1411019,498052675,7/29/2019,This place was awesome! It was in the heart of Dublin. Walking distance to everything. You dont need to waste the money renting a car while youre here. the place was beautiful and the cats were too cute :)
1411019,499247057,7/31/2019,"Stay with Sam!! My 80 year old grandmother did the stairs, so can you! Sams place is in the ideal location and his hospitality was on point, not to mention the adorable and cuddly cats!!"
1411019,504191796,8/7/2019,Great neighborhood to be in and within walking distance to everything! Clean room and fantastic balcony views.
1411019,505560026,8/9/2019,This is a great place in the city centre.  Sam is very accommodating and gave us some useful tips on how to enjoy our time in Dublin.
1411019,508792985,8/13/2019,"Sams apartment is a DREAM! The room is beautiful and clean, the bed is super comfortable, and the patioîvery cool, especially in the evenings, where you can see The Spires point glowing. The apartment is located centrally, and everything to see and explore in the city is no more than a fifteen-minute walk away. Sam responded very promptly to my messages and inquiries, and I especially appreciate how he helped me with my luggageîboth upon arrival at and departure  from the apartment. Thank you Sam!"
1411019,513198671,8/19/2019,"Clean, private room. We loved the garden area at the top! Here were cats in the main loving which we loved but may want to keep in mind if you have allergies. It can be a bit loud if you sleep with the windows open at night since it is in a more busy area of Dublin, but that is to be expected with such a central location! Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper!"
1411019,515631321,8/23/2019,"Sam's Airbnb was a wonderful experience! The location is convenient to the city centre. There are restaurants, bars and shops nearby. A short walk brought us to the River Liffey. From the river, we found our way to Temple Bar. We did not need a taxi nor a bus. We have been to Dublin many times. We love it! On our walk from our Airbnb, we discovered a new favorite restaurant. Zaytoons, an Arabic restaurant with wonderful food. It is easy to follow vegan/vegetarian diet there. The roasted stuffed peppers and stuffed aubergines are amazing. We ate there several times. Sam is very friendly and accommodating. He has three lovely cats who are willing to be cuddled by strangers. The guest room is well done. Lovely and comfortable experience. We would happily stay there again."
1411019,517318420,8/25/2019,Very good location yo get to the bars and restaurants in Temple Bar. Accommodation very clean and comfortable
1411019,522565996,9/2/2019,"Wonderfully located, clean place to stay, with the added touch of a few friendly cats :) Host was very kind and helpful as well."
1411019,525914302,9/8/2019,Perfect location for a weekend in Dublin. Highly highly recommend!!
1411019,529971964,9/15/2019,"Great location and warm hosts.
I worked at my computer in the living room, and found the cats very relaxing."
1411019,532636819,9/20/2019,"The location is perfect, the amenities were great.  He has three cats but they are very friendly and don't bother you. Communication was very good and Sam was very helpful. We would stay here again."
1411019,538851271,9/30/2019,"Sam's a very friendly host, interested in people and their stories. My husband and I had some very nice discussion with Sam when our timetables intersect. 

Location of Sam's place is fantastic - a short walk to virtually anywhere in the city centre. The built-in ""stair-master"" whipped us in shape - 81 steps walk to the top floor suite and no elevator. Could be intimidating at first but the rewards are cool view, nice breeze, and getting fit and ready for your many city walkabouts!"
1411019,544130125,10/9/2019,Sams place was in a great location and was very clean! We loved our stay in Dublin!
1411019,545465924,10/12/2019,"We really enjoyed staying at Sams place. The apartment is located close to city transit options, shopping and a lot of restaurants."
1411019,550772125,10/19/2019,"Sam's place was perfect for our Dublin visit. It is very centrally located for everything we wanted to see and do--pubs, music, museums, historical cites. We bought a bus pass we never used because everything is so walkable. The room is very private and the bed very comfortable. Though neither of us is really a cat person (we have dogs) we loved meeting and getting to know the very friendly kitties who graciously share the space with Sam and Ab. We appreciated the exercise the four story climb provided everyday which, at the end of a long day out and about, we affectionately dubbed the ""stairway to heaven ""."
1411019,557611671,11/1/2019,"Location was great, right in the centre of Dublin. Sam was a great host. Unfortunately, we didnt see much of each other as my husband and I were out a lot. We would definitely stay again at Sams place."
1411019,566038207,11/18/2019,"Sam's place is in a great location, walking distance from many different interesting neighbourhoods. The apartment is beautifully decorated. I would definitely stay here again my next time in Dublin."
1418666,439529607,4/19/2019,"I loved staying at Alan's place. The location was perfect for me -- a pleasant walk along the canal to get to work and great location for restaurants, morning coffee, etc. I felt like I was living in the neighborhood I'd want to live in if I actually lived here, which was exactly what I was hoping for. The upstairs was beautiful and full of sunlight even on somewhat gloomy days. I'd absolutely stay again."
1418666,470666914,6/16/2019,"The two separate bedrooms and bathrooms make it an ideal flat to share for 2-4 people. The kitchen and living room upstairs are bright and spacious - perfect for hanging out. Also, had no issue finding free parking close by. On top of that Alan is a terrific host. Had a brilliant stay!"
1466234,420969915,3/8/2019,"I am deeply sorry about what happened on the first day. I mean I was come very late night. I know she has working every morning early. But she wait for I come to the end..  

The house was great like my home. 
I was happy with you .."
1466234,423197315,3/13/2019,Amazing little space for one that is well located.
1466234,425508975,3/18/2019,It's a good quiet place a bit pit of the centre :)
1466234,431627298,4/1/2019,"Nice place and friendly hosts. Cheap, quite, clean and warm. I would repeat. Thanks you for everything!"
1466234,439556916,4/19/2019,Very convenient location close to the city centre and easy public transport!
1466234,443648711,4/26/2019,Comfy spot in a location right by the bus stop. Good bang for your buck
1466234,447793164,5/4/2019,"clean, quiet, spacious, excellent lighting and bus station is very close, that takes you to the center in 15 or 20 minutes. I recommend Mis Elva¬¥s place 100 %"
1466234,451159735,5/11/2019,Excelente!!
1466234,457587743,5/24/2019,Great location for public transport
1466234,467397140,6/10/2019,Tranquilo.
1466234,477437410,6/28/2019,A place to put your head after a long day
1466234,484673608,7/9/2019,"I enjoyed my time at Elva's home! The room was clean and very comfortable for me to stay in. The family dog, Buddy, is so cute! Elva's sons are nice and always said hello to me. I would recommend this host and would stay here again!"
1466234,488670369,7/15/2019,Elva and her sons were nice.
1466234,496406624,7/27/2019,Elvas home is so comfortable- I was on Dublin for an academic conference and the room has a great desk for working. She was a very sweet and welcoming host and Buddy the dog is a wonderful addition!
1466234,499458878,7/31/2019,"This was an outstanding place to stay! Not right downtown, so youre out of the hustle and bustle, but really easy to get to with public transport. Elva was great too!! Either having something prepared for breakfast or leaving it up to me, the whole experience was enjoyable. Also their dog is really adorable too."
1466234,520878838,8/31/2019,I stayed 4 week at elvas lovely house. The check in was very easy. Elva is a very friendly person. She is used to tourist so she speaks a very good English to understand. The room is small but totally comfortable. Elva was really friendly. I could asked her everything and she always tried to help me. I enjoyed the talks we had.  I rent a bike so it took me 20 min to cycle into town. But there is a bus station just in front of the house. I am so glad to met Elva and her family.
1466234,527665881,9/11/2019,"Elva is a great person and the place is the best BNB I had so far. It is very good connected with the Bus to city center, the room is lovely and tidy, the persons are friendly and the area is very quiet! The prize was amazing and I enjoyed my stay very much! Thanks to Elva for the friendliness!"
1466234,554370967,10/26/2019,"I highly recommend this place! Elva and her sons are very nice and their dog is cute! I did not find it so cold in the house, but the electric blanket is really pure luxury! The room is good as it is! I was there for 3 weeks and I felt very well. You do not need more! Once a week I was able to wash my clothes. The bus stop is almost on the doorstep. I would like to thank Elva very warmly, also for the nice conversations and for the invitation for dinner, which I could not pursue, which I am very sorry. Top accommodation! Great people! Gladly again!"
1466234,557522852,11/1/2019,Really nice place to stay!
1466234,564644744,11/16/2019,Elva was an amazing host. The house is really close to public transportation and the bathroom was always clean. It was a really short trip but I had a great time.
1489545,426241535,3/20/2019,"Aguir and his wife are a wonderful couple, it was good to met you. They are really sweet and ready to help in case you need anything."
1489545,434027198,4/7/2019,Lovely home and lovely people!
1489545,446411789,5/1/2019,"Nice Appartement, really close to Dublin and Howth. Train station is just a few minutes away. Aguiar and his wife are great hosts, they gave us advices and theyve been hearty and   Interested! We would definetely come back!"
1489545,449345200,5/6/2019,"Accommodation is great and although it is away from the center there are many places of interest like a large beach, a castle with beautiful gardens in Malahide. A direct train to the city center is nearby. The hosts are great young people who like to advise you on everything you need. We were very happy to meet them."
1489545,451808256,5/12/2019,"A friend of mine and I spent a long weekend in Dublin and definetly chose the right place to stay. The communication with Aguiar was quick and easy, same as the check-in and check-out. The flat was clean, the two cats just lovely and the bed as cozy as you could wish.  During daytime there is a good connection to the city centre, in the evening you have to look after the schedule or take a taxi.
The only thing to mention are the train and airplane noises close by - we weren't disturbed, only for others to know.
A place to recommend!"
1489545,453981412,5/17/2019,"The Aguiars are very friendly. They answered our questions and gave us very good tipps.
I can just recomend a stay in this appartement :)"
1489545,459307493,5/27/2019,"Absolutely lovely hosts! Perfect location, homely, welcoming, just loved it!
Would definitely go back"
1489545,460413263,5/29/2019,a really friendly host and a clean and tidy accomodation. Thanks a lot for everything
1489545,463397521,6/3/2019,"Aguiar and Vinnie are two very lovely people. They helped us with all the questions we had and showed us great hospitality in their flat. They are two very open minded and kind people.All in all, amazing hosts and a great Airbnb!"
1489545,465182395,6/7/2019,Das Ehepaar Aguiar war sehr freundlich und unkompliziert.
1489545,466441609,6/9/2019,"Aguiar and his wife are very friendly and their flat is in a convenient location with both DART trains and buses to Dublin a short walk away. The room we slept in had a comfortable bed and was quiet, however, there were issues with cleanliness both in the bedroom and the bathroom we were using (it didn't seem as though these rooms were cleaned before our arrival) and the bedroom was very sparsely furnished (there was no hairdryer and only one towel per person)."
1489545,467624320,6/10/2019,"Great communication, Aguiar is extremely good host! Thank you!"
1489545,468864597,6/13/2019,"Aguiar is a gracious host that stayed up to help us with a late check in, help us on future adventures with recommendations and provide excellent details on whatever we needed. The nicest host! Thank you Aguiar!"
1489545,469875237,6/15/2019,Just needed somewhere to put our heads down for the night after a concert in Malahide. Did what it said on the tin
1489545,472230739,6/19/2019,"Brilliant hosts, lovely people and an excellent room. Very comfy bed. Slept great."
1489545,497212294,7/28/2019,"Bright and spacious place, kitchen has everything you need
Some noise from neighbors and the close by airport"
1489545,508050968,8/12/2019,Ras parfait...
1489545,513417593,8/19/2019,The place is nice. Hospitality is great. Train station is really near so Dublin is easily in reach. Elvis and Piaf made the house cosy
1489545,529863339,9/15/2019,They are very friendly and always open for a conversation. Dublin was easy to reach by train. They also have 2 lovely cats who will make your stay even better.
1489545,534082982,9/22/2019,A clean space and comfy bed near beaches but with quick links into the city.
1489545,535476926,9/24/2019,"Aguilar's hospitality is outstanding as is his kindness and willingness to interact with guests, the neighborhood is nice, the bed is very comfortable and the fluffy cats are the cherry on top!"
1489545,543145407,10/7/2019,"Very nice couple with cute cats. The communication was very easy and they where very  helpfull with tips and anything else we needed. 
The house is next to a train station which is very convienent.
We would  reccomend to stay here."
1489545,545006448,10/11/2019,Thanks for accommodating us.
1489545,546112924,10/13/2019,"Aguiar is very nice host, willing to help us with the transport and everything we needed. Housing nice, comfortable bed, cats ... :-) everything was perfect, we really enjoyed our staying in Dublin."
1489545,553173937,10/23/2019,"Aguilar was very hospitable, and the location made it easy to get into Dublin. However I dont recommend staying if you have even the slightest allergy to cats. I dont have a serious allergy and we kept our door shut but the cat hair made our stay difficult. I understand that it is hard to avoid cat hair in a home with two friendly cats, but I would use discretion if you have any level of cat allergies. Otherwise, the house was clean, in a nice area and close to the station."
1489545,554447661,10/26/2019,"Priscilla was a great host. She welcomed us in the evening and showed us all the flat, which was exactly as in the pictures. Everything was very clean and well organised. Their two cats are very quiet and friendly. We would definitely recommend staying with them if you want to be close to the city but avoid all the noise."
1489545,568231014,11/24/2019,"The place was wonderful! The location of the apartment is not too hard from the city center but it is also in a good area! Also, it is close to the airport! The hosts are wonderful. Super friendly and welcoming! I suggest this place if you plan on traveling to Dublin, Ireland."
1500892,425423675,3/18/2019,"Matt's place is very close to the airport, which is handy if you have an early flight. The breakfast was good and self-service. The beds were not really comfortable, but okay for one night. Unfortunately the heater didn't work and it was really cold in our room...communication could have been better in this case, although matt usually replied quickly"
1500892,431026957,3/31/2019,"The location for Matt's AirBNB was a good location. It's literally 10-15 minute walking distance from the Dublin Airport, and is near a lot of bus stops for you to take into town, which is 40 minutes away from the place. The place was nice and clean, and would definitely recommend for those trying to find a place near the Airport."
1500892,440174166,4/20/2019,Great spot at the airport. Highly recommend if youre looking for an easy wake up before a flight.
1500892,440837223,4/21/2019,"Matt's place was so conveniently located near the airport. It only took a few minutes to walk to the place after having a late flight arrival at Dublin Airport and then easily accessible for catching an early morning flight. The continental breakfast was nice. He provides several different kinds of cereal, toast, milk, juice, coffee, and fruit. The serving room was nice and quiet to enjoy my breakfast meal. The shower was nice and hot. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend Matt's place for catching an early morning flight."
1500892,450741523,5/10/2019,"As stated.  Super short walk or taxi ride to the airport.  My wife thought this had breakfast included, although there is an area like a dining area, there were some fruits but not a breakfast.  

Excellent for quick in and out!"
1500892,454068907,5/17/2019,Perfect location. Nice B&B for one night.
1500892,454499687,5/18/2019,"Best location for flying out from. Very good, reasonably priced food in bar close by."
1500892,460104822,5/28/2019,"The building is not fancy but it is clean. The location is perfect, you can walk to the airport and car rental offices. There is a good restaurant next door."
1500892,463973197,6/4/2019,"Matt was very friendly and accommodated our early checkout time, room was as shown in the images, nice and clean. Would recommend."
1500892,464262738,6/5/2019,Great location for a early flight out for an easy walk to the airport!
1500892,467402587,6/10/2019,Nice place to stay with a great location. Next to the airport and a few minute walk to an awesome cocktail lounge. Easy to check-in as well.
1500892,474728876,6/23/2019,"Surprisingly quiet for an airport location. Great communication from Matt and some travel tips for our plans. Toast, cereals, fruit and tea & coffee in the mornings."
1500892,478692660,6/30/2019,Very uncomplicated and super easy communication! We arrived very late and they put the key in a locker. Ideal for just one night.
1500892,482226268,7/6/2019,"close to the airport and car rent agencies.
tidy.
small rooms and some noisy due to traffic"
1500892,483076764,7/7/2019,Everything was clean and tidy.  Matts instructions made check in easy even with us arriving late and leaving early.
1500892,486841673,7/13/2019,The three bed room we booked was as expected. We used the room only for one night before we collected a camper close to the airport for our one week stay in Ireland. The provided breakfast in the breakfast room was good. We can recommend Matt's Cloghranguesthouse B&B.
1500892,507252681,8/11/2019,Great place very close to the airport. Basic and simple accommodation but very clean and comfortable.
1500892,513971114,8/20/2019,"This B&B is located directly across from the car rental return, so very convenient. Beds were comfortable. Did not avail of the breakfast as we left too early. Quiet and slept like a log despite being right next to airport. Recommend."
1500892,528519315,9/13/2019,"Had a great stay here.  Matt is a very accommodating host. The location is only about 10 to 15 minute walk to the airport which is very convenient for early morning flights. The price was much cheaper than the nearby hotels. The room was clean and comfortable. There is also restaurant next door. There is a major road in front of the building, so there was some street noise, but it didn't impact my sleep."
1500892,536326099,9/26/2019,Great to catch an early flight
1500892,544106013,10/9/2019,"Matt knew what he was talking about... location, transportation, etc.  Comfortable room and everything was spotless.  Can't say enough about convenient location to the airport.  Surprisingly not noisy.  Yes, an occasional rumble, but really just a low level background hum trust didn't disturb me. Going back here again"
1520036,503088509,8/5/2019,"Thanks for a lovely stay. In one word our stay was superb. Brendan was thoughtful kind helpful and always available. We stayed for five weeks and had a blast. What you may or may not see through the photographs is the incredible energy that Brendans apartment possesses. 
I do hope my future travels brings me to Dublin  and if that should ever materialize I will not hesitate to stay in Brendans apartment. Cheers"
1520036,532581491,9/20/2019,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1550394,422528378,3/11/2019,"Fantastic location sandwiched between Dublin Castle and City Hall across the street from Temple Bar.  All of the tourist sites we were hoping to see were within a 2 mile walking distance.  The day tour buses to Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and similar sites are located within 4 blocks as is the 747 bus from Dublin Airport.  We did our grocery shopping at Dunnes which was about 4 blocks away.  The apartment is 2 bedroom, 1.5 baths with a spacious common area and a reasonably stocked galley kitchen.  One of the bedrooms had a brand new, comfortable mattress which arrived on our first day.  We ate out more often than our normal airbnb stay due to the diversity and quality of nearby restaurants and pubs.  Luke's communications were excellent though we didn't have the opportunity to meet as Luke was on an international trip.  We were met by Luke's Mom, Serena, who was extremely gracious and welcoming.  We stayed for 12 days and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  We would definitely stay at Luke's again."
1550394,426240930,3/20/2019,"Lukes place was amazing! We met his mother Serena at check in and she was so incredibly kind, warm, and helpful! Lukes communication was also so quick and helpful! The location is PERFECT, and the home was lovely! When we come back we will definitely stay here. Highly recommend!"
1550394,440762876,4/21/2019,"Fantastic place and location! Honestly you can't beat this location. 2 min walk from Temple Bar, but not loud at all. Literally in the center of Dublin sites. We were 2 couples in our 30s/40s. The space accommodated us perfect. Rooms are on opposite ends of house, so there is privacy. Luke was a great host and got back to us quickly even though he was out of town. We never got the TV to work (not Lukes fault, but hopefully fixed). The only thing we suggested was simple house instructions. We weren't sure where to put trash, etc. Overall we absolutely loved the place and would definitely stay again!! Don't forget to start your day off with and Irish coffee across the street. Unbelievable!!"
1550394,446866922,5/2/2019,"Lukes apt. is centrally located in Dublin close to, and walkable to most major attractions.  The location is the highlight of the apartment.  It was spacious enough, and the two bedrooms are at opposite ends of the apartment which is great for privacy.  The trade-off is that it does get noisy at night especially when the bars close.  Weekends are much noisier than mid-week.  There are 1.5 bathrooms but only one shower which was fine for 2 people, but could be a challenge for 2 couples.  The half bath is rather small with a small wash basin which would be a challenge for a bigger person.
Although Luke was not there (traveling internationally), we were met by his mother Serena who lives upstairs. She was very nice and informative, and also left some basic food and kitchen supplies (as well as ponchos for the rain).  It was great to have coffee and milk for the morning before we got to go shopping and the brown bread with creamy Irish butter was quite tasty.
We did have a higher expectation for the cleanliness of the apartment- the kitchen and appliances were in need of better cleaning and the bedrooms did not appear to have been vacuumed prior to our stay.  We were also a bit leary of the washer and did not use it.  
Overall, Luke and his Mom were very friendly and helpful when needed and the location of the apartment was a big plus.  It was also a bit pricey compared to other Airbnbs weve stayed at but it is priced primarily for the location as previously stated.  A very good choice for a young couple looking to be centrally located in the heart of Dublin who are not light sleepers and enjoy city living."
1550394,451211317,5/11/2019,"Luke is a great host! The apartment is clean, well-stocked, and in a great location - a short walking distance to just about anything you need (food, pubs, public transportation, activities, etc.).  The apartment looks just like the photos. Luke responded quickly when we asked him a few questions and even left a couple of rain ponchos for us (which we didn't even need!). If we go back to Ireland we will definitely try to stay there again!"
1550394,457090597,5/23/2019,"If you are looking for accommodations in a very central location, this is the perfect place. It has a lot of charm being a very old, historic home. All the necessities are there and includes a washer and dryer. I would recommend it and should we ever be able to return to Ireland, I will try to stay here again.."
1550394,473901250,6/22/2019,"Luke's place is the perfect location to enjoy the sights of Dublin with Temple bar within a block, a quick walk to Trinity College, the train station and many other activities!  The apartment was beautifully appointed with everything we needed!"
1550394,487777495,7/14/2019,This space is a great location for travelers who want to be in the midst of the action. Its location to the major festive (bar areas) cant be beat. Its about a 5-8 minute walk to Trinity College (even with the hordes of people). In the evening it did get a bit warm and we had to open the front window exposing us to street noise and revelry of party-goers. The back bedroom has an amazing sliding glass door that kept the area cool at night. Luke is amazing at correspondence even when hes on holiday. This is a great place for couples and solo travelers who are into the party scene! We enjoyed our time here immensely.
1550394,492519695,7/21/2019,Newly renovated living space near everything in the city of Dublin.  Great Pubs and restaurants.  Right across from a live theatre and on the entrance to Dublin Castle.
1550394,523341347,9/3/2019,Fantastic apartment right in the heart of Dublin. You couldn't ask for a better location and the apartment itself is surprisingly peaceful despite its central location. Luke is a fantastic host and always responds rapidly to any or messages or queries. Thanks a million for a great stay! 
1550394,526024204,9/8/2019,What a nicely decorated apartment this is. It looks recently renovated. Great location. 10 minute walk to Trinity College and near by cosy restaurants. Luke answered fast.
1550394,533227705,9/21/2019,"We stayed at Lukes place for 2 weeks. You couldnt ask for a better location, adjacent to Dublin Castle and within easy walking distance of many interesting areas....churches (eg Christchurch and St Patricks..also check out one of the oldest, St Michans, shopping...Grafton St, Henry St, museums-we particularly like the Yeats museum and the Little Museum of Dublin, Trinity College, the lovely St Stephens Green park, cafes and restaurants-Queen of Tarts nearby, Avoca, (Website hidden by Airbnb) well as the easy access (Dart) to some of the small fishing/seaside communities - Howth, Bray, Dun Laoghaire etc. The highlight of this Air BnB is its historical significance; built in 1790, for a time it was a charity of the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers Society. Fortunately the house was preserved and renovated and to this day is a testament to the dedication to, and the priority for, maintaining and keeping this piece of legacy and history alive. And one can sense the history inherent in this home. Its a good place to make one feel at home amongst the locals in Dublin. Thank you to Luke for all his info and quick responses and for allowing us travelers a glimpse into the past."
1550394,551499231,10/20/2019,"Lukes place is very well located, literally everything is only 5 mins walk away."
1550394,559531250,11/4/2019,"Location is hreat.  A nice comfortable place right in the city. Easy access to cafes, transport and food outlets. Will definitely stay again."
1551644,450822425,5/10/2019,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back again sometime.
1551644,484178789,7/8/2019,"The house was sparkling clean, the view was absolutely outstanding and Myriam was a great host, welcoming us with food essentials etc. 
P.S There really are horses outside the place!"
1551644,486847125,7/13/2019,"Nice apartment, though its more like a cottage in feel, wonderful scenery and view"
1551644,508806779,8/13/2019,Wonderful location.  Peaceful and serene.  Great host.  Perfect start to our Ireland vacation.
1559929,428585328,3/25/2019,Would definitely recommend staying with Natasha if you are coming to Dublin. Great hospitality and accommodations in a central location.
1559929,449719854,5/7/2019,"Natasha was a lovely host with great communication prior to and during the stay. 

Beautiful and clean home. I was kindly put up in the double room of which the bed was a very comfortable as well as the surroundings. The bathroom was big with a really good power shower.

Excellent location with amenities at the end of the road, within short walking distance to Stephens Green, town and tourist attractions with the addition of good bus links for further afield and to the airport. 

I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend. 

Thank you Natasha ! x"
1559929,454472921,5/18/2019,"I had the single room in Natasha's house and highly recommend it. Everything is just perfect: The cosy room, the sportless bathroom, the lovely house and interior, the sweet little garden, the location - very quiet but central, too - and the great friendly host, Natasha, who was most helpful and offers a lovely breakfast in the morning. I had a great stay."
1559929,466535813,6/9/2019,"What an amazing place and host! The proverbial home from home and more, amazing hospitality, great location, beautiful space, one could not ask for anything else. A complete gem, highly recommended!"
1559929,470556096,6/16/2019,Very nice and cozy place! Very friendly host.
1559929,483157553,7/7/2019,Natasha has a beautiful house that is a haven of tranquility a stone throw away from the city hustle.  I highly recommend her a non invasive and perfectly charming host.
1559929,534176280,9/22/2019,"Natasha is a lovely welcoming host and her place is so stylish, full of character and situated very centrally. Appreciated the info from Natasha on what's on, especially as it was Culture Night in Dublin. Natasha's place comes highly recommended - a real treat."
1559929,560296373,11/6/2019,"A warm, comfortable environment in a great location."
1563973,477955047,6/29/2019,Its a good place to get a real spirit of Dublin.
1566503,418461939,3/2/2019,"We had a very homely and warm experience for the 6 weeks in Dublin. The house is equipped with great amenities and is convenient to get to city centre / grocery stores. The interior design of the house is really cool! Iain was prompt in responding to our queries. Thank you for the hospitality! It's a pity that the house might not be on Airbnb listing in the near future. If possible, we'd definitely like to return to this house when we visit Dublin again!"
1566503,425447897,3/18/2019,"I had a great stay in Iain's apartment. It was very clean, nicely decorated and more than spacious with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room and kitchen. Attractions such as Trinity College or Temple Bar can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Iain always gave me good advice. I can only recommend him. Gladly again."

1566503,431597734,4/1/2019,"A cool Dublin townhouse in a very central location. Easy to get to from the Airport on the Airlink bus (747).

The house design is quirky, but this really worked for us as we had friends with a baby so the downstairs bedroom was great for them. 

The kitchen is fully functional with a large fridge, hob and microwave. Bathrooms were clean and not too small. 

Living room had all the tech you'd need and great for chilling out in the day or evening. Good selection of books and music to browse through.

As cyclists we found the bike equipment very useful and there are two bike hire shops just 100m or so away. We used River Cycles which was easy and cheap for the day.

Great location. 5 mins from the centre and close to good pubs and bars. 

Iain was a great host and very communicative. The house manual was very informative and comprehensive. 

Would stay here again for sure."

1566503,482224786,7/6/2019,"We (4 ladies) stayed 4 night in this wonderful apartment. It was exactly as described, everything we needed was available. So nice details all over the house (pictures, decoration, even the equipment in the bathrooms!), very stylish and nothing was missed. The house is located very close to the city hotspots - within Dublin downtown but still quiet and aside the trouble. We could manage everything walking on foot, perfect!
Iain was a perfect host as well, very nice, taking care and responding directly! Really appreciated him to be that available and taking care about our stay. Absolutely recommend this apartment - we definatlely plan to come back soon :)"
1566503,490309949,7/18/2019,"The location was great. Also wonderful that you can access the apartment with a digital keypad. Also we were able to drop our luggage early which was helpful.

As some noted there are a lot of stairs do keep that in mind!"

Everything was exactly as described. I especially want to mention that the whole house was very clean and tidy. Iain was a very good host, he answered quick an precisely. We would like to come back anytime and recommend this holiday rental. Besides this, Dublin is great, vivid, rough, beautiyful,  interesting..."

We didnt have the pleasure of meeting Iain in person but he was very helpful and responded to all my messages immediately.  

We had a great stay!"
1566503,532762887,9/20/2019,I was on a week long trip for work and this place gave me a nice little escape to unwind after a long day. It had the creature comforts of being in someones home vs a hotel or bare bones air bnb. I really liked that I could park right out front with street parking which made having a car super easy. I wish I was able to just rent one room as it was only me staying so the price was a little higher than my needs required but would certainly stay again.
1566503,534943080,9/23/2019,"Ian's property is well located to all that Dublin has to offer.  It seemed to be a residential area, so not as bustling and loud as other areas of the city, but so close to everything that we wanted to do while visiting the city."
1566503,536698339,9/27/2019,"Amazing place... Amazing decoration, really cozy appartment ... Very nice area, close to everything. Easy check in and check out.

1566503,543616669,10/8/2019,The host canceled this reservation 176 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1566503,546979787,10/14/2019,"Great location, great interior style, great character, great amenities. Iain's place was an overall great option and we would definitely be okay staying here again. You can walk pretty much anywhere within the city limits. It was easy to come and go as we pleased. It was kind of tricky to find the exact location at first, but we figured it out. We were able to get snacks and water and then store them in the kitchen nicely. The laundry machine was great to have since I pack very lightly (although I tried to use the dryer but it didn't seem to dry too well - maybe I did something wrong?). The artwork and books are really fun to browse through. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and easy to use. Overall, the place felt welcoming. Iain was nice and easy to communicate with."
1566503,562672176,11/11/2019,"Thank you so much Iain for sharing your home with us! The location was ideal, as the home is thoughtfully located a few streets away from the main city but still close enough that you can walk to every attraction easily. The communication was fast and effective, and the beds were extremely comfortable!"
1582908,457541674,5/24/2019,"Paula provided a comfortable experience, and was extremely helpful with any questions I had. The house was very lovely, and well decorated with a cute backyard perfect for relaxing and enjoying a good meal. Several delicious restaurants within walking distance as well. 

Great experience overall :)"
1582908,461231462,5/31/2019,I would highly recommend the accomodation at Paula's  house to anyone. She is very helpful and likes to give tips for sightseeing and excursions. The room is clean and several bus routes to the city centre can be reached within a minute.
1600779,452525935,5/13/2019,Natasha was a fantastic host for my solo trip to Ireland. She was very responsive and even let me check-in early. Her place is lovely (the pictures dont do it justice!). It is multiple stories with a picturesque garden. The kitchen has so much bright natural light. The neighborhood is just a short walk from most of the tourist spots and near great restaurants away from crowds. Totally safe to walk about! Would highly recommend and would book again in an instant!

1605305,433352625,4/6/2019,The Kavanaghs Mews is well furnished and spacious. We travelled as a familly (4adults and 2 kids 2.5 & 4.5 years old). We found everything we needed including groceries and pharmacy in walking distance.
1605305,436573584,4/13/2019,"A spacious quiet safe location in Dublin,  and while removed from city centre, transportation is all around and we walked almost everywhere within 40 minutes.  Self check in/out was easy and we had a nice Irish welcome basket to greet us as well.   For those who need a larger space and the ability to cook, it is a good travel option.   Kicking us off every morning were the sea gulls and bright sunshine.  WiFi is very weak/spotty though so I'd recommend making sure you take advantage throughout the day in town/tours.  Good recommend though for families traveling to the area and really felt like locals in the Mews!"
1605305,449348821,5/6/2019,"Really great apartment in a lovely part of Dublin.

The place is as described in the post and all amenities are very near by. You have a scrum diddly's right at the street corner. Dart/Bus is a 4 min walk. The pier is nearby and a great place to spend at leisure. I would recommend anyone to definitely stay in her place!"
1672082,536232396,9/26/2019,"This was a very convenient and easy stay for the end of a month in Dublin. The house is very central for a travel base into downtown Dublin, or south to Dalkey (via DART) and easy to drive or take a tour out to Wiklow Mountains . Easy walks to groceries and restaurants in Dun Laoghaire as well as the Pier /Harbour.  Internet worked well which can be hit and miss in some Airbnb's/BNB's I stayed. I was out most of the two days I stayed but the kitchen was also clean and well set up, bed/bedroom clean and comfortable and Kathy was kind and helpful."
1672082,542352735,10/6/2019,"Kathy was a great hoestsst, very kind in welcoming his guests"

1717912,429589739,3/28/2019,"Bob was awesome--my flight had a significant delay, causing me to check in 14 hours later than expected, at about 2 in the morning. I communicated the situation to Bob and he was more than understanding and stayed up to let me in, show me around, and give me a brief overview of the city with a free map.

I liked it because it wasnt in the mayhem of the tourist area so at night the neighborhood was quiet, but it was close enough that getting anywhere was a breeze.  I walked my entire trip and had no problems getting to what I wanted to see.  Would recommend staying here and will if I ever visit Dublin again."

1735698,445982881,4/30/2019,"We loved staying at this beautiful location, close to everything but still private and quiet. I highly recommend staying here for a memorable experience in Dublin."
1735698,480643094,7/3/2019,"The description of this unit is quite accurate. It's a well situated flat. It's very quiet and the rooms are nicely furnished with old pieces. We especially liked the bright, sunny kitchen. The living room is a little darker, but overall the unit is very pleasant. Our family enjoyed it very much."
1735698,501336376,8/3/2019,"Such a gem - and what an amazing organization. We were left wanting to plan an entire trip around Ireland just to stay at their locations.  Absolutely perfect location.  Airlink from the airport drops off at the end of the street.  Grocery store at the corner.  Dozens of pubs/restaurants/coffee shops all around.  Yet amazingly quiet due to the location at the center of the block.  Comfortable beds (queen/full/full) with great bedding.  Fully equipped kitchen with washing machine and dishwasher.  Large living room isn't pictured, but has a comfortable couch and several armchairs.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
1744402,421333177,3/9/2019,"They say that there is no place like home.. well, you might feel otherwise once youre welcomed here. Think about visiting your uncle and aunt at a beach house out of a movie. Thats the feeling I had!"
1744402,424902044,3/17/2019,"Eamon and Margret was soooo great! 
It was really nice to meet them both. I really hope so that we'll meet again. 
Their house is so great and cozy, it really felt like home."
1744402,427824813,3/24/2019,Second time around and the hospitality just doubled. Great people with a big heart who enjoy hosting and making everyone feel at home.
1744402,437243159,4/14/2019,"We said in advance that we were going to arrive late and, as having a baby with me, I needed confirmation that was ok.
We got there at 1am, finding an couple of nice old person waiting for us, kind, smiling, taking time to make us feel home at that time in the night.
Same warm behaviour in the morning.
The nicest people I ever met.
A special memory of Ireland for us."
1744402,439592484,4/19/2019,"Was made feel so welcome from the moment I arrived. I was well looked after, I dont think I went a second without a cup of tea in my hand, I was in my element. Absolutely brilliant hosts and would recommend to anyone!"
1744402,446343751,5/1/2019,"Eamonn and Margaret are wonderful hosts. Their home is in a quiet corner of Portrane with good connections into Dublin. If you want to travel by public transport, get a Leap Card. These fine folks made me laugh every day."
1744402,449322026,5/6/2019,"I spent such a good long week-end at Eamonn and Margaret's place.
They live in a cute yellow and white wood-built house, yellow being Margaret's favourite colour!
The place is a bit hidden, along a quiet narrow road ending to the beach (no car park there, it is protected).
It looks like everyone in this area built its paradise corner, some in concrete, some others in a mobile-home, long ago, when we didn't have so many rules, which makes it a bit special and unique.
It was exactly what I was looking for to have some nice and long walks along the beach. If you push it in the direction of Donabate, you have a small portion of walk along the road but then, a every nice coastal walk from one Martello tower (Portrane) to another (Donabate), passing along the incredible huge Victorian style Portrane ex-mental hospital.
But what made my stay unique is really the kindness, hospitality and joy of the hosts, they really make you feel at home and you would dream of having them as part of your family!!!
Your next guests are lucky."
1744402,452895847,5/14/2019,"Quiet place, great hospitality and wonderful hosts!"
1744402,454434488,5/18/2019,Eamonn and Margaret were the perfect hosts. They are so lovely and welcomed me into their home with open arms. The room is a good size with a comfy bed. They are in a lovely location close to the beach.
1744402,458664136,5/26/2019,Eamon and Margaret are the most conscientious hosts you could hope for. They are so welcoming and so warm. Withing minutes we felt at home. They are a pleasure to be around and leave you to your own space when needed. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. To stay here is a complete pleasure and if you are umming and arring please just book it!
1744402,462832820,6/2/2019,We couldnt have picked a better home or more welcoming hosts! Beautiful beach house and so comfortable! Everything was absolutely perfect!!
1744402,467981474,6/11/2019,Eamonn was very quick to respond to my messages and was very obliging.  My father was staying with Eamonn as he was working close by and he was content with his accommodation.
1744402,470458731,6/16/2019,"Just back from a lovely stay with Eammon and Margaret. We went down for a concert at Malahide castle, the house is so handy for public transport, there is a bus stop just at the end of the road. The house is cosy and the welcome was fabulous. Eammon and Margaret are an absolute delight to be around! Will be back!"
1744402,474572328,6/23/2019,"I would most definitely recommend staying here. Eamonn and Margaret were fantastic hosts. Nothing was to much trouble. Very friendly couple. My daughter and I were at Malahide for a concert, Eamonn dropped and picked us up from the train station. Great breakfast would definitely stay there again"
1744402,477940272,6/29/2019,"Wonderful stay in a nice location with friendly, helpful and warmhearted hosts! Hope to be back some time!"
1744402,481226710,7/4/2019,Eamon and Margaret are lovely hosts. It was a pleasure to stay in their home. Margaret made a beautiful breakfast in the morning. They treated me like a family member even though we had just met. I would recommend to anyone to stay with Eamon and Margaret.
1744402,482376643,7/6/2019,Lovely hosts! We had a wonderful short stay in this Chalet near the beach. Eamonn and his wife were so welcoming and kind. Would recommend to stay here!
1744402,486833728,7/13/2019,"This airbnb was a wonderful experience.
Absolute amazing location. Super close the the beach. Fantastic beach walks!
Also it is very close to the airport, which made is booking. Perfect if you wanne escape the busy Dublin.
The rooms were very cosy, very comfortable beds. Absolute quiet at night. We even got a breakfast at 6:30 AM in the morning. Always would come back!"
1744402,492337077,7/21/2019,"Lovely people who were so welcoming, felt like we knew them for ages!"
1744402,496258910,7/27/2019,I would certainly recommend staying with Eamonn and Margaret.  They were very welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay - nothing was too much trouble.  The location is perfect for anyone wanting to either visit Dublin or experience a peaceful seaside break - it's only minutes from the airport or a short train journey to the city from nearby Donabate.  We will be back!
1744402,500583828,8/2/2019,"Really nice place in a quiet country side by the sea. Really nice friendly hosts and very helpful especially with transport. If you are looking for good value, honest caring hosts, a quiet location and for a touch of a typical Irish village experience then look no further than here. Highly recommend."
1744402,506163675,8/10/2019,"Eamonn and Margaret are wonderful, friendly and thoughtful hosts that made me feel right at home. The room is cozy and the bathroom spacious and pretty. The nearby beach is fantastic, and the house is about a ten minute walk from the local pub. 
Thank you so much Margaret and Eamonn, I hope to be back!"
1744402,516537175,8/24/2019,Comfortable homely place in beautiful sea side location. Eamonn & Margaret very friendly.
1744402,527256346,9/10/2019,"Nice and great stay. Very friendly people, have great tips and be verry careful to visotors. Next time we will come again."
1744402,528547938,9/13/2019,"Persone squisite , ti fanno sentire a casa."
1744402,538098228,9/29/2019,"Unbelievably welcoming, and shared in some great conversations and good laughs. An overall great end to what was already a fantastic trip to Ireland. The epitome of Irish hospitality :) Thank you, Eamonn and Margaret."
1744402,555219087,10/27/2019,Lovely friendly couple who went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable
1744402,566008148,11/18/2019,They are very kind and warm like a family
1754515,419638144,3/4/2019,"This place is situated in a fantastic central location. 5 minute walk to Temple Bar area and good traditional local pubs on your doorstep. Everything that was needed for our stay was provided. Communication with James was with prompt responses and he was more than happy to help us out. I cant recommend this place enough its outstanding value for money with everything you need in quick walking distance, thank you!!!"
1754515,421022599,3/8/2019,A spacious and clean apartment in an amazing location. I would definitely stay here again.
1754515,421920244,3/10/2019,James place is a no frills apartment with a great location for a short stay. He also provided tips & tricks for my first AirBnB rental and trip to Ireland.
1754515,423140386,3/13/2019,"As other reviewers said, the apartment is pretty bare bones, but James' communication is awesome and the location is well worth the $$$"
1754515,423860384,3/15/2019,This place was great.  James was super helpful with check-in and giving us tips on parking.  It was super close to everything.  The apartment had everything we needed plus extras.
1754515,424262401,3/16/2019,"Such a charming place to stay in Dublin! It's very close to lots of restaraunts, a grocery store and it's within walking distance of Trinity College where you can see the Book of Kells. There are about 3 flights to climb, so keep that in mind if you have lots of luggage. The apartment is quite large with an open floor plan and huge windows that let in tons of natural light. They're a bit drafty but the space heater takes care of the chill no problem. Good kitchen set up. A nice tub for relaxing after a night pub crawling. The bed was a bit uncomfortable but not to the point that I couldn't fall asleep. I would totally stay here again."
1754515,425923399,3/19/2019,James place was perfectly located right in the center of the city and the place was sparkling clean.
1754515,426521830,3/21/2019,"James' loft is as cozy and lively as Dublin city itself. The location is perfect, 50 m away from the river bank! Gorgeous windows views and a clean, huge space. We'll return, because we loved Dublin, dubliners and James's loft!"
1754515,426904545,3/22/2019,We were pleasantly surprised at just how close the flat was to everything-extremely central. Such a beautiful spot and great communication from James! He told us good breakfast spots near by and made sure we had everything we needed. Would 100% recommend this place to others and will definitely be coming back.
1754515,427314724,3/23/2019,Great location!
1754515,428490478,3/25/2019,"Great location! We had a little difficulty getting into the place, but once we were there it was great! James was helpful, and responded quickly."
1754515,429264845,3/27/2019,"We stayed here during a long layover in Dublin and it was perfect for a short trip.  The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable and the location couldn't be beat.  Thank, James!"
1754515,430329632,3/30/2019,Amazing space. Great neighborhood. Steps away from the nicest and cutest streets and shops
1754515,431030623,3/31/2019,"Jamess apartment was perfect for what we wanted, had everything we needed and was in a great location, communication was fast, only slight downfall bed was a little uncomfortable."
1754515,431925512,4/2/2019,A decent value for money and great location. However the bathroom faucet configuration makes it impossible to use warm water and my girlfriend scalded her hand because the one tap was so hot. No electrical outlet in bathroom and the other outlet near a mirror didnt function properly with the adapter. There wasnt a top sheet on the bed which was not appealing.
1754515,433964510,4/7/2019,Perfect location! I hate to write an excellent review because Id like to keep this place a secret. :) James was an amazing host and checked-in periodically to see how things were coming along and to see if I needed anything to help my stay be more comfortable. The apartment was perfect for me and has everything that one can need or want. Thanks James for everything!!!
1754515,435709162,4/11/2019,"Just like in the pictures, perfect location. Perfect."
1754515,436074173,4/12/2019,"Overall we had a good experience staying at James place in Dublin. Navigating the city isnt the easiest for us so this location was perfect. There was a parking garage just around the corner so that worked out great. I will say if you are elderly or out of shape this is not the place for you to stay. There is about 3 floors of steps  that you will have to carry your bags up and down. Also, the place could  stand for some updating/ upgrades. If you can overlook the decor, paint job, and outside street noise this place will be a great place to stay in Dublin."
1754515,439131230,4/18/2019,"I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, but after flying for 6 plus hours and then having to walk around an unknown city to Jamess wifes old work to get the keys at 5:00 in the morning it makes it hard. The accommodations were subpar at best. The bed felt like we were sleeping on a box spring and the pillows were paper thin. The couch had a giant rip in it, and there was only a small heater for the whole place. I would not recommend this place to anyone staying in Dublin."
1754515,440193484,4/20/2019,"The apartment is in a great location, perfect for exploring Dublin. It can get a little noisy during the night due to its location above a bar, but nothing some earplugs won't sort! The space could do with a lick of paint and the bed isn't the most comfortable."
1754515,442357400,4/23/2019,"Nice place. Simple place. Not fancy but if you want that go to a fancy hotel. This place is clean and has what you need (clean bed, shower kitchen)
It is close to the sites. Easy to get to from the airport. Grocery store is close. Great value for the price. Host communicates well."
1754515,443103294,4/25/2019,The location is great.
1754515,444082184,4/27/2019,Great location! James was very easy to communicate with and quick to respond
1754515,445388871,4/29/2019,"Like other reviews said, this Airbnb is a great location but bare bones. I was surprised to walk in and see how bare bones it was. The bed was basically a box spring and the windows were quite drafty. It was just a place to lay our heads. Bonus is that James was very responsive and helpful. Overall, Id say if you want a good deal and location, and dont care about the Airbnb itself...this would be the place for you."
1754515,448591987,5/5/2019,"The apartment is a GREAT location and a very quick walk around central Dublin and Temple Bar area, shopping, sites, etc.  It's located on the 3rd floor so be aware of that.  We just came off a cruise so we had luggage to carry up as there are no elevators.
It's secure with magnetic locks and you have to get through 3 doors to arrive at the apartment, which again made it very secure.  We appreciated that.
The apartment is having some work done and needs a little more care but its a big open space and equipped making it a great option, again, considering it's location.
James was VERY easy to get a hold of, made easy arrangements for us to get the keys and offered lots of suggestions for the area.  If you like the price, book this apartment."
1754515,452564642,5/13/2019,"The best location, very clean, and great host!"
1754515,453576819,5/16/2019,"Like many have said, very bare bones. Also one of the most uncomfortable mattresses Ive ever slept on. Fantastic location though, so if you want a simple place to stay to be able to experience the city center and temple bar area, this place is for you"
1754515,455917350,5/20/2019,Great Location!
1754515,457094429,5/23/2019,Thank you for a great stay! We couldnt have asked for a better location!
1754515,463970252,6/4/2019,"This Dublin apartment is an incredible value. The location is amazing - right in downtown Dublin and walkable to anything. For the price, you cannot beat it. James is a responsive, accommodating host and helped us get an early check-in after a very early flight. Just note this is a 3 floor walk up if you have heavy bags!"
1754515,465175292,6/7/2019,"Great location, good communication with the host, bright and comfortable appartment"
1754515,465658639,6/8/2019,Didnt end us staying here. James was kind in his responses but due to conflicting schedules we and issues with getting into accommodation we had to cancel
1754515,469210571,6/14/2019,"Perfectly situated for a trip to Dublin, nice & surprisingly quiet accommodation."
1754515,469891832,6/15/2019,"Jamess place was in the perfect location, close to everything, and super spacious. Communication was easy and he was accommodating. We would definitely stay again!"
1754515,471383341,6/17/2019,The description was exact. Well located and the check in was made through an attendant in a Cafe really near the studio. I recommend it.
1754515,473337346,6/21/2019,"I chose this place primarily for the location - it looked like a short walk to everywhere I wanted to go and didnt disappoint!
I was a little concerned by reviews that mentioned problems with noise, but I didnt have any issues with that at all. This could have been due to me staying from Tuesday to Friday, but I didnt notice any noise from the bar downstairs or the other local pubs.
The space itself is bright and clean with all the basic amenities, and Id recommend the nearby Brother Hubbard for a fantastic morning coffee/breakfast/brunch! I would definitely stay here again."
1754515,477012707,6/27/2019,"Location, location, location! Five min walk from Dublin Coach stop and the airlink 747 to the airport. Literally across the street from Templebar and down the street from O'Connell. Everything is walkable- even the three flights of stairs was no bother. The cafe's and bakery nearby will literally make the morning sunlight streaming through the spacious loft something out of a novel. 

There's everything you need to stay in with the Spar just down the road.

James was very accomodating and kind! 

Will be staying here again if I can."
1754515,477394358,6/28/2019,"Just stayed one night and it was perfect for 2 of us. There are a few flights of stairs to go up. It's in a great central location and still we had no problem with street noise being too loud. Plus, this was the only place we stayed that had a good working fan!"
1754515,478981417,6/30/2019,"The place was great, very very much central, even though there were bars close by the noise wasn't too loud, it also stopped very early so it wasn't an issue.

The place is a studio but very spacious, has lots of unique items in the house that give it a good vibe, really enjoyed the space. 

The bed was very comfortable."
1754515,484213658,7/8/2019,Perfect location! Close to all the action but you're on a side street sort of so you can sleep easy at night. Easy and flexible check-in. The place is bare bones but it was perfect for us to sightsee. Bed is extra firm and there's no AC and the windows won't open. Oh and you're on the 3rd floor. But price for quality canNOT be beat!
1754515,489689584,7/17/2019,"Jamess place is centrally located and check in was a breeze. Big, open apt in a very secure building. Great spot!"
1754515,493402718,7/22/2019,Great location. Within walking distance to everything in Temple Bar and the train station. Only negative were the stairs to the third floor.
1754515,494534347,7/24/2019,"This place is in a great location, but youve got stairs to walk up to get there with some flashing lights in the stairwell. The view is nice from the top and you dont get any noise from the places below you. Pantibar, a gay bar, is right below the apt. and its actually quite a nice spot for a drink. Also helps that youll be staying right above itîjust remember youve got stairs to walk up after those cocktails 

The space itself left me wanting a bit more, but its a studio so Im not sure what else I expected. 

We had a few questions and some issues with communication through Airbnb messages, but Im unsure if it was an issue with the app itself. 

Overall, we didnt stay inside most of the time anyway, so the location made this place key. For the price, I would stay again!"
1754515,498132996,7/29/2019,"The location was really good. Early check in time was one of the main reasons we chose to stay there after coming in the red-eye from overseas. The place is pretty noisy, but thats to be expected given the very central location. It needs a good cleaning but was manageable."
1754515,504162231,8/7/2019,James' apartment was in a great location and is a no frills apartment. My only complaint was how uncomfortable the bed was. I stayed there 3 nights and don't think I could have slept there any more. Overall it was a great experience
1754515,504688629,8/8/2019,Great stay! Beautiful apartment in perfect location. I would highly recommend it to visit Dublin city center.
1754515,507064121,8/11/2019,"James was really communicative from first booking and gave us great travel tips on both getting to the place, checking in and ideas for what to do whilst in the area. The place was nice and clean, with interesting decor (cow radio anyone?!)

Two things to consider before booking though: 
1. The place is on the top floor and there is no lift and 
2. The place is above a gay bar, which means It could be a little bit loud, but we loved it and found the bar a great place to go for a drink. 

Would 100% come back, thanks so much for having us!"
1754515,514028538,8/20/2019,"Well-situated, brilliant for the Luas and for exploring Dublin without paying an arm and a leg. Great for the traveller on a budget!"
1754515,519806336,8/29/2019,"James place is so central to everything it's a great place to stay! It is a few flights of stairs up so be ready for that, but it's worth it for the price and location."
1754515,521727768,9/1/2019,Cozy place in a great location. Everything is walking distance aways.
1754515,522627996,9/2/2019,"Fantastic place, perfect for couples, and it's an absolutely amazing location. The place was so clean and comfortable, and James was super in his responsiveness and his tips. We had an amazing time. We will definitely be back!!"
1754515,525178842,9/7/2019,The location is great! Close to the the night life (Temple St) and walking distance to all that Dublin has to offer. We walked from the apartment to St Pats Cathedral within 20 minutes.
1754515,525930159,9/8/2019,"As others have described. Excellent location. Clean. Has your basics. Others complain about the bed, I had no problem. Stairs, which aren't an issue for most. Some noise from the street but we stayed on a Saturday night.  Great value,  perfect location. Parking garage a block away for around 30 euro for 24 hours. I would choose to stay at James place again"
1754515,530886462,9/16/2019,"Perfect spot for exploring Dublin for a few days. Good value, and easy to get to all ""tourist"" attractions."
1754515,531733648,9/18/2019,"This loft is in a perfect location to tour Dublin by foot. Central, across from Temple Bar, and extremely quiet.

This is located directly above a fantastic gay bar which we had great drinks at and enjoyed the atmosphere.

It is on the 4th floor with no elevator, but this was well noted on the listing so we were fully prepared to climb the stairs!

Wonderful place to stay, and would definitely stay again."
1754515,534931794,9/23/2019,"The location is very good, just a quick walk and you are at the main spots, a supermarket directly is at the next corner.
The apartment was clean and typically for Dublin standards. 
James wasnt around but he replied very quick so everything worked out well.
We can definitely recommend a stay at the flat!"
1754515,535467527,9/24/2019,"Great space for two people in a super convenient location, was walking distance to center city dublin. The host was also very easy and quick to communicate with. Overall a great stay!"
1754515,536184490,9/26/2019,"Central location, clean apartment!"
1754515,542361385,10/6/2019,"Great location, quiet at the weekends. There are quite a few flights of stairs to go up but all in all a great little find."
1754515,546199031,10/13/2019,"The  house is in the best location. A part from the location, I really like the big windows. But the house needs renovation. The mattress is really uncomfortable, the paint has to be redone and the forniture needs to be renovated. The price is lower than other solutions I have seen in that location, but still expensive. At least a good mattress should be provided."
1754515,546875566,10/14/2019,"James is a very good communicator and check in was easy. However, it was our last night in Ireland and we were looking for a nice centrally located flat and were disappointed. The location of this flat is good but we were disappointed at the unfinished state of the flat, the stark decor and the front halls/entrance to building."
1754515,547508675,10/15/2019,Great location!
1754515,549355850,10/18/2019,"The location can not be beat, central to everything. I walk everywhere when visiting a new city, and James place made that so easy to do. I didnt have an issue with the stairs, but the bed was a bit trying in the back after the first night."
1754515,552719116,10/22/2019,"This place is an absolute dynamite location! Can't argue that. I was a bit miffed at how absolutely terrible the mattress was and the fact that I got locked out because of a malfunctioning key fob. Again the fob, not James's fault and he was really good with communication. But ya, dude, mattress..... I think it was older then me.
Overall, great spot to party in the city center."
1754515,553139393,10/23/2019,"Cons: The toilet tank takes around 40 minutes to fill with water, the ceiling was cut for some repairs.
Pro: Center location, quiet place"
1754515,553555315,10/24/2019,It was a lovely apartment in a very central area. Really good price for the location. The only downside was walking to the top floor to get there. It was a great quirky apartment
1754515,560971031,11/8/2019,I didn't have any problems with hosting!  The location is very good!
1768437,425470493,3/18/2019,"Our stay with Lia was very good, she was very warm and welcoming and we felt at home since the beginning of our stay. We could use the kitchen as we pleased and she provided us some things like bread, juice and jam to make breakfast for ourselves. There are two buses that connect with the city centre running each every 30' so there's a bus every 15' (during the day only)."
1768437,426199121,3/20/2019,Very comfortable and an excellent host.
1768437,427232579,3/23/2019,Lia`s Hospatality was great. Excellent place to stay when visiting South County Dublin for business or short break. Marie

1768437,442388375,4/23/2019,Lia's place is great and I would strongly recommend it.
1768437,445382014,4/29/2019,"Pros:
- Convenient location for both Dublin and nearby countryside.
- Comfortable room including a desk (and an early edition of The Lorax by Dr Seuss!)
- Lia was friendly and helpful (including doing some laundry for me while I was out!)

Cons:
- The hallway had (to my nose) a significant smell of cigarette smoke. Thankfully it was barely noticeable in the bedroom, and not at all in the kitchen.
- The bathroom had a non-frosted window."
1768437,448467666,5/5/2019,"Lia is very warm, welcoming and easy going. She made me feel  comfortable and at home. She also  helped me with my mobility scooter and made the access to her garden where i parked it as easy as she could. I really enjoyed chatting to Lia and would definitely stay again. Her home is colpurful and arty which i loved with a lovely garden. V impresed!"
1768437,451960935,5/12/2019,Lia is a lovely and hospitable host. Beautiful quite clean house in a very nice part of Dublin.
1768437,453291163,5/15/2019,Lia is a wonderful host and I always have a very comfortable stay on her home. She goes out of her way to make you feel welcome but is also respectful of your privacy. I will most definitely keep returning to stay!
1768437,455774480,5/20/2019,"Arrived early and Lia was more then willing to have me check in early. Her place is out of Dublin, but very easy to get to and not far from the water. She was very friendly and offered me some tips about things to do in Dublin and locally and how to get around. Even though her place is outside of Dublin, I had no problem finding places to eat. There is a Lidl and Aldi right up the road and cafes and shops in the local town as well. Lia made sure to check in every day to see how I was getting on and consistently asked if I needed anything. I will definitely be coming back!"
1768437,458712702,5/26/2019,Lia was a lovely host. I had a long day and it was nice to get a comfy bed and a good sleep. Will be back

1768437,473878543,6/22/2019,"Nice room with a spacious bed and a good desk for working/studying. Lia has a really nice garden, which is perfect when the Irish sun is shining:)"
1768437,487853921,7/14/2019,"Lia was very friendly and helpful. The main downside was that the room smelled of stale cigarettes but after I aired it with the window open a few hours it was fine. Not super close to the coastline towns but walking or bus there was pretty easy, and the price was good."
1768437,499891467,8/1/2019,"Had a lovely stay with Lia. She is a fantastic host and very caring, ensuring you have everything to make you comfortable. I will certainly be back!"
1768437,518316066,8/26/2019,"Great location for the sea front, and hills. 
Nice room and lovely garden. 
Very welcoming host."
1768437,526756352,9/9/2019,At a very good location. There is a big Aldi and Lidl near the house. The connectivity is good with bus 7A. Overall value for money spent.
1768437,533907448,9/22/2019,"Lia is a delight and staying with her way great! Her place felt comfortable and homey, and had everything I needed. I really enjoyed my stay!  It's close to buses that can easily take you to Dun Laoghaire and Dublin, but do your homework about the area, as it is quiet and residential. It's great value and I'll be back again."
1768437,540931766,10/4/2019,Lia was an extremely friendly host and the room was spacious and clean. Would definitely stay here again!
1768437,543779220,10/8/2019,"A lovely little room in a nice house. A stone's throw away from Dun Laoghaire and the Dart, and with easy access to local bus routes taking you into the city. It was a pleasure to stay here, and Lia was a fantastic host."
1768437,552337239,10/21/2019,Lia was a complete joy and made my stay wonderful! I highly recommend for house!!
1768437,553889496,10/25/2019,Lia was a wonderful host. Very helpful & responsive
1768437,558925987,11/3/2019,Lia welcomed me warmly to her colourful home. Might not be the best place if you are a light sleeper or sensitive to cigarette smoke.
1768437,568433875,11/24/2019,"Lia is a great host with a great home! Great value for money in an area which can be pricey to stay in! Lia made me cups of tea, washed my clothes and made me feel very welcome!  Great location to walk in to town and all necessary shops within a couple minutes walk. I travel to Sallynoggin frequently and will be staying here again!"
1791386,421933970,3/10/2019,I booked the same day & it was a wonderful experience for my guest who popped in unexpectedly. They were quick to respond & very accommodating.
1804494,427991946,3/24/2019,Fiona was an absolutely delightful host. The house is in great location - not too far from the city centre and in a quiet location. A few nice touches like milk and breakfast items upon arrival. Thank you!
1804494,454498231,5/18/2019,"What a perfect home! Located in Clontarf, you will be a quick bus ride in to city center -  about 12 minutes. Theres a Nolans grocery 10 min from the home, and an Aldi and Lidl about 25 min walk from there. With the location being very close to the ocean, anywhere you walk will be quite lovely. 

The home was cozy, furnished with everything you need. Kitchen was loaded with all the essentials, and quite stylish. 

My wife and I had the opportunity to stay 2 months here and we loved every moment of it. We will definitely be back if we can! Fiona was quick on the responses, and took great care of us when we had questions. 

All in all, this was what you would expect from a stellar Airbnb!"
1804494,473824535,6/22/2019,"Fiona's place was great. We stayed for 3 weeks and it has everything you need. It's a cozy, sunny place in a great neighbourhood"
1804494,483111970,7/7/2019,"Fiona's apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very close to the sea and well connected by Dublin Bus network. We could recommend this place for a couple or a family. Fiona was a great host, very responsive and was flexible with check in and checkout."
1804494,496281740,7/27/2019,"I booked Fiona's place for my parent's 2 week visit to Dublin and could not be happier.  Nice clean, spacious and bright apartment in a beautiful part of Dublin by the coast, it is close to Clontarf's fabulous local eateries and amenities and only 15 minutes into town  by bus.  Fiona was a great host and a pleasure to deal with.  Highly Recommended!!"
1804494,530037598,9/15/2019,Great place for a week of work in Dublin. Easy access in and out of Dublin and its very quiet. They had nobody checking in the day of my departure so let me decide on my check out time. Outstanding hospitality. Well definitely be back.
1804494,546159976,10/13/2019,"Fionas townhouse is in a perfect location. Clontarf is so nice lots of stores, bars and restaurants .  We had a great time."
1804494,555223197,10/27/2019,"Beautiful townhouse. We loved the conservatory! Plenty of room for our family of four. 
Amazing treats ready for us when we arrived. Thank you so much! 
Lovely area too - great for sea walks along the prom and nice restaurants and parks nearby. 
Sparkling clean. The photos dont do it justice. 
Fiona was really helpful and very understanding when we encountered a problem. 
Really recommend and will be back!"
1804494,560630704,11/7/2019,"It was an amazing experience and a beautiful space, I loved the communication between Fiona and I. I surely recommend this place."
1860001,470673927,6/16/2019,"Eamonn is a great host and a great person. Super friendly, always willing to help even for the little needs, and he knows how to make you feel welcome and at home. The house is lovely, and my room very large and comfortable. The location is amazing, the area is very elegant, peaceful and at reasonable walking distance from everything. Highly recommended. Thanks a million, Eamonn!"
1860685,420338253,3/6/2019,No Thanks
1860685,421882900,3/10/2019,"Ellie is a wonderful host - she stocked the fridge for us, provided laundry tokens, and gave us lots of tips in binder format. The apartment has everything you need for a pleasant stay and is close to many restaurants and pubs but is still quiet at night. We did have some problems with the tap water (was told not to drink it for a day), but that was a neighborhood-wide problem. Ellie is also renovating the apartment soon, so Im sure it will be even nicer in the near future!"
1860685,423520450,3/14/2019,Small but convenient flat which felt like a real home
1860685,451695143,5/12/2019,Ellie could not be a better super host! She is incredibly thoughtful and offers such a warm and genuine welcome. Easy access to the apartment and thoughtful amenities like simple groceries and local recommendations. Her home is a lovely respite from the fun and busy city center. I highly recommend her home and we would definitely reach out to her again!
1860685,458617943,5/26/2019,We really enjoyed our stay at Ellie's apartment.  She is an excellent host and provided us with many great suggestions for the neighborhood upon our arrival and during our stay.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood and close (walkable) to many of the attractions of Dublin.  The apartment was very clean and Ellie provided us with many little 'extras' for breakfast and for snacks.  We highly recommend the apartment and Ellie as a host!!
1860685,461933095,6/1/2019,Ellie is a super host. She really makes you feel at home. And her apt is well situated and well stocked to fine you the feeling of being a resident of Dublin. Its a great place!!
1860685,463923751,6/4/2019,"Great location, cleanliness was 10/10, extremely cozy and breakfast items in the fridge were just some of the little touches that Ellie does to ensure your stay is perfect! Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again."
1860685,465796276,6/8/2019,"Ellies house is wonderful, the room is clean and comfortable. her house is easy access. Also Ellie is very nice, she gave us information when our car was broken, and she even prepared some food for our breakfast. Highly recommend to everyone:)!"
1860685,477496626,6/28/2019,"Everything was perfect at Ellies place. She met me upon my arrival, explained how everything worked and even filled the fridge with lovely staples (bread, OJ, cream, coffee, butter, cheese, eggs) so I was well set to fix myself a lovely breakfast the next day. Location is far enough away from the hustle and noise at the city center, but close to a bus line that goes directly there or if youre up for a nice walk thru Stephans Green, its about 30 minutes to the city center of Dublin. Directly across the street is a pub and restaurant, it can be noisy at night when the patrons stand outside and have their beers, but Ellie has gone beyond and installed sound-proof windows which work like a charm.  I would definitely recommend Ellies lovely apartment and would stay again should I travel to Dublin in the future."
1860685,482398480,7/6/2019,Ellie was lovely and very willing to make suggestions on how to get around and did her very best to get me in early.  Much appreciated!  She made her place very welcoming and made me feel at home right from the start.  Thank you
1860685,484710286,7/9/2019,"Beautiful modern apartment with every amenity you need. This host has raised the bar on our expectations for future trips - the FIRST one to actually put the NBù in AirBNB!  We enjoyed being outside the hub of tourist activity - this ones in a posh neighborhood.  We liked walking to downtown attractions- allowing a nice stroll through St. Stephens Green each morning and evening. Also, super easy connection to airport bus 1/2 block away.  We loved this spot - the host provided excellent tips on transportation options.
Exceptional value."
1860685,496454970,7/27/2019,"Ellie was a fabulous host - we couldn't have asked for more.  The apartment was very clean and she left plenty of snacks for us in the fridge which was quite a nice surprise.  The pub across the street was great, too - one of our favorites and we visited it more than once!  The sheets and towels, furniture, etcetera were all of very nice quality, too.  This place is an excellent value.  We would definitely stay here again."
1860685,508186880,8/12/2019,This place does not disappoint. We were so happy we booked it and loved it. Ellie is so responsive and an amazing host. She leaves food in kitchen for an easy breakfast and gives great recommendations. The area was great it was quieter which is what we needed. I would recommend this place if you love a little get away and want to stay off the beaten path from tourists.
1860685,514435754,8/21/2019,"Ellies apartment is amazing. I stayed here in August 2019 with my cousin and we had an incredible time. The apartment is small but so well decorated and feels very comfy. It is an easy walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Also , there is a great AirCoach service that goes almost right to the front door from the airport for about ‚Ç¨9 per person each way. Very reasonable. We also did three bus tours (Cliffs of Moher and Belfast with Paddywagon Tours, and the Dublin Hop on Hop off tour) and we were able to walk to the meeting places from the apartment.
Ellie goes above and beyond. The bed was very comfortable and she left us some beautiful fruit, cheese, bread, and salami which was very appreciated.
Unfortunately we were not able to meet Ellie in person but that was because our flight was delayed. However, Ellies communication with us was great and she was extremely helpful in ensuring we had everything we needed, as well as helping us with getting our keys. We would recommend this apartment to any two people interested in exploring Dublin. Perfect for friends or couples!"
1860685,515813223,8/23/2019,All perfect. Thank you very much!
1860685,525879149,9/8/2019,"If you stay here, you will not be disappointed.  My mom and I stayed here for 3 nights and were happy to call it our home base.  Ellie was there to welcome us and give us tips on seeing Dublin as well as great places to eat.  She also graciously provided some groceries that went way above our expectations.  The location of the place is great, as it is easy access to lots to see and do."

1906221,445929948,4/30/2019,"As a Single, Senior, Female traveler, I am very particular where I stay and with whom. I can honestly say that staying with Vadym and Jose has been this time, as well as the last 5 times been part of the best experiences I have had in Ireland. The location is great for getting around the city and connecting with places outside the city using public transportation. The apartment is lovely, comfortable, very clean and welcoming. They work hard to make sure their guests have everything they need. I would recommend them to any of my family or friends."
1906221,455832855,5/20/2019,Thank you for a great trip to Dublin!

We would highly recommend this AirBnB."
1906221,472755266,6/20/2019,We had 3 nights staying in Jose and Vadyms apartment meeting both of them while we were there. The place is exactly as the photos show and while a little away from main city centre it is so easy with luas only a minute away and the leap visitor card was good value (we purchased the 72hr for ‚Ç¨19.50).  It was an easy 10 min walk to Guinness Storehouse and the arch cafe is just across from apartment for a good value for money breakfast (‚Ç¨3.50 huge bowl of porridge). The apartment was very quiet so we slept well and very informative information on their profile for public transportation etc which was all accurate.
1906221,476466082,6/26/2019,Jose and Vadym were very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is very updated and is as clean as a hotel room. The place is very close to public transportation and is located in a safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again!

1906221,488510952,7/15/2019,"We had really awesome time and felt welcome for the whole stay. Vadym and Jose are the kindest hosts and their cat Linda is a beautiful lady! Clean, cozy, comfortable, great location (super easy to get to the centre) - perfect place to stay in Dublin :)"
1906221,493421784,7/22/2019,"We could not expect a better welcome from our host, Vadym, who not only spoke great English, he also spoke out mother tongue!

1906221,518909326,8/27/2019,"A lovely space, very clean and tidy.  A short walk from the city centre and right next to a tram stop.

1906221,533239160,9/21/2019,"Vadym and Jose's home was lovely, and so was Vadym. 
I really enjoyed my stay there (check out the art, it was stunning) and I hope to visit again. I appreciated all the little touches (usb charger) and how comfortable everything was.

Note: I had to take a taxi because the LUAS didn't operate in the early morning of Saturday, so check your travel times before you book. Taxi fare ran me about 30 euros for a 5:45am pick up. 
Otherwise, it should be an easy trip via the 747 airport bus and then the place itself is very close to the LUAS station. 
Note the check-in time is stated as 5pm, so bear that in mind!"
1906221,535465858,9/24/2019,"Vadym is a wonderful host. Very considerate and so welcoming. The apartment is spotlessly clean, private and very stylish. The kitchen had all you could want and the bathroom is for your sole use. Close to public transport and some of Dublins best sites."
1906221,536753411,9/27/2019,"Jose and Vadyms place exceeded all of our expectations. It was a 2 minute walk to the LUAS station (Fatima) and that helped us a great deal, as my husband is currently on the mend from a broken leg. The room and apartment was sparkling clean and very stylish, yet very warm and inviting. We felt right at home and even enjoyed coffee on our private balcony. I would highly recommend staying with Jose and Vadym during your stay in Dublin. We enjoyed it so, so much!!"
1906221,542167897,10/6/2019,"The apartment is well connected to public transport. In addition the apartment ist very clean. 
The two guys are great hosts and give great tips for our stay in Dublin. Thanks a lot :)"
1906221,552233973,10/21/2019,Highly recommended once you get your bearings. Its a close walk to the Guinness Brewery.
1906221,553172705,10/23/2019,"Very nice and stylish apartment. The directions were perfect, Vadym met us and gave us some good tips for the city. The apartment is immaculately clean and the neighborhood is quiet! It is about a 20-35 minute walk into town center, but take the tram, it is worth it, so convenient.

Another tip, while Dublin is lovely, we particularly loved getting out a bit. Malahide Castle and the town near it are a quick and affordable Dart ride out of town (so is Howth), and you get to see and smell the sea before tucking into a cozy pub."
1906221,557588842,11/1/2019,Very friendly and welcoming host :-)
1906221,558931377,11/3/2019,We had a lovely stay and Vadym was very welcoming. Good communication for arrival and the location of the apartment is very easy to get to. Thanks for making things easier and letting us leave our luggage later than normal.
1906221,560637657,11/7/2019,"Thank you! It was a nice Trip. 
Vadym was very nice and we felt comfortable. Everthing went well."
1906221,565355978,11/17/2019,"A lovely warm and homely place to stay with style and immaculately presented throughout. Bed very comfortable. Vadym was very polite, friendly and hospitable. On my way to work he left fresh filter coffee for me in the kitchen, was much needed. This little thoughtful touch made such a difference to my stay. Highly recommend this place!"
1906221,565993346,11/18/2019,Lovely host. The apartment was just as advertised and a good location.
1906221,566437450,11/19/2019,"We had a great stay at Jose and Vadyms Airbnb! The apartment is very clean and modern and is in a good location close to the Guinness storehouse as well as other bars, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. definitely recommend!"

1929739,471394666,6/17/2019,"Jose & Vadyms space was beautiful and perfect for what we needed for the night. Its right next to a tram line that is very convenient to get to the city center, but still walkable (~20-30min). They were wonderful hosts and communication and check in were a breeze. Would definitely recommend :)"
1929739,475558574,6/24/2019,"It was an amazing stay in Dublin. The place is very well situated, the room is very stylish, clean and cosy with all the amenities and extra thoughtful items and information (like the map of Dublin, a list of emergency numbers and tips, and breakfast like coffee, tea, fruit etc). The communication with the hosts was quick, very clear and thoughtful. On arrival, I felt very welcome and well accepted. I would highly recommend staying at Jose and Vadym's Dolphin Barn. It was a five-star stay! Many thanks for a wonderful stay in Dublin, all the best, Erica"

1932609,448624404,5/5/2019,"Helens place is in a prime location - footsteps away from all the action in Dublin. Helen was also a great host and she let us drop off our bags well before check-in time so we could roam the city freely. 

I was really fond of her place like the water pressure in the shower - hey, its the little things that go a long way!"
1932609,452537200,5/13/2019,Helen is very helpful and attentive. Her apartment is in the perfect spot in the center of the city yet quiet.

1932609,473906786,6/22/2019,"Helen was warm and very communicative. The apartment has a great location--close enough to Temple Bar to be convenient (lots of restaurants and pubs),  but not right in the middle of what can be a very noisy area. The windows also face a courtyard  and not the street, which makes it quieter. Check in and check out were a breeze. Definitely recommend."
1932609,478976877,6/30/2019,Helen's place is in a fantastic location and very comfortable.  Her communication was great with us was phenomenal.  The apartment worked very well for my family of four.  I would highly recommend it.

1932609,492518044,7/21/2019,"Helen is echt een super host. Zeer gastvrij en behulpzaam. Bij vragen kregen we elke keer gelijk een antwoord. Het appartement is niet heel groot, maar voldeed prima voor vier personen. Zag er erg netjes uit en bevond zich aan de rand van het Temple Bar District op een geweldige locatie."
1932609,495046376,7/25/2019,The place is seriously in the best location. It's a minute walk to restaurants and all the bars and it's on a quiet street so it's not noisy for sleep. The place is well kept and very stylish. The host is very considerate and responsive. She was great!

1943366,452470836,5/13/2019,"We were close enough to walk to all the attractions we wanted to see.  The neighbor was nice and staying in an old, but very clean and updated, room was exceptionally nice. Amazing sunset views from the front windows!"

Grocery stores and a good pub are just minutes away on foot.  Bus stops could not be more convenient.  Advertised for up to 6 guests, this place is not very big and has only 1 bathroom.  Would be much more comfortable for 3-4 people. Still, our family of 5 had a wonderful time there."
1943366,473322476,6/21/2019,Liam and Fionas place was great! Amenities are nearby along with the big park and zoo within 1km.

Ensuite was very clean and stylish. Towels were very thick and nice and the comforter was cozy. Beautiful outside garden which was lovely to look out at each morning.

Easy transportation to the city via bus or taxi. 
Highly recommend staying at Robyn's."
1963074,426495803,3/21/2019,My second stay at Robyns. Really comfortable with everything you need and only a short bus ride from the city centre. I didnt meet Robyn this time but she responded immediately to messages and made me feel very welcome. Would definitely recommend

Sitje buiten. WiFi goed. Parkeerplaats op het privestukje. Bus naar het centrum voor de deur. Hebben we gebruik van gemaakt. Duurt ongeveer 20 min voor 3 euro. Komt om het kwartier. Huisje een aanrader.
1963074,443129543,4/25/2019,"I loved being at Robyn's house.  She is a kind thoughtful lady and there is everything you need, including a small kitchen that has a microwave and fridge.  The room is so peaceful looking out onto the garden. The No. 9 bus stop is right outside the door and they run every 15 to 20 minutes.  I bought a Visitors Leap Card which was very useful.  I would highly recommend Robyn's place to stay."
1963074,443574363,4/26/2019,"Really beautiful home with a gorgeous garden. Lots of really lovely extras like slippers and hot water bottles to coffee and yoghurt for breakfast. Would highly recommend, and will definitely be back."
1963074,444012164,4/27/2019,Robyn was very hospitable.  We had an afternoon in Dublin and took the bus to town.  She recommended a great place to eat.  We had an early flight the next day and her place is in a great location near Dublin Airport - very convenient.  The room was perfect - quiet and comfortable.  Thank you!
1963074,444617335,4/28/2019,"Excellent place. Very clean and comfortable. Everything from booking to check-in and check-out went very smooth. Better value than many other options in Dublin. Hot and cold drinks as well as breakfast included which was much appreciated. A bit of a trip into the city but well located in relation to airport. 
Would recommend this place."
1963074,445397163,4/29/2019,Robyn made our experience in Dublin great. It was easy to get around with the bus (bus stop right across the street). We had our own entrance and the airbnb was sparkling clean. Thanks again!

1963074,449184872,5/6/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The place was very clean, and Robyn thoughtfully changed our towels, changed the garbage and cleaned a little halfway through our stay.

1963074,456740110,5/22/2019,"Robyn's place was clean, stylush, and comfortable. The back yard was a little oasis. We really appreciated having some breakfast foods and coffee and tea provided."
1963074,457560545,5/24/2019,"We were pleasantly surprised with Robyn's place. It is situated on a busy road, but once inside it is extremely quiet. There is everything you need and it was spotlessly clean. There was also a lovely table and chairs overlooking the pretty garden, which was nice to sit at."
1963074,458010166,5/25/2019,So lovely and clean
1963074,459342503,5/27/2019,"Robyn is a kind person. Her place is very special, with a wonderful garden and terrace. It is a real Bed & BREAKFAST as she has it all available. Very comfy."

Would definitely recommend staying at Robyn's"
1963074,461245468,5/31/2019,"This room is absolutely perfectly located (close to tourist spots and the airport), such a comfortable and cozy (and spotlessly clean) place to stay in Dublin.  Its very close to the botanical gardens, but I didnt go because the backyard garden is so lovely and I preferred to stay and relax rather than rush through sights (I only had a 22 hour layover).  Robyn has thought of everything - stocked the fridge with yogurts and waters and milk, provided fluffy towels and even a hot water bottle.  She is so responsive and caring and generous.  You wont be disappointed if you stay here.  Highly recommend!"
1963074,465239234,6/7/2019,"Robyn was a charming and thoughtful hostess.  She went out of her way to make our stay in her home a pleasure.  Her home is in a great location ...easy access to both the airport and the centre of Dublin.  The bus stop for downtown is virtually on Robyns door step.  And the bus ride itself was fun; the view from the top deck gives you an excellent tour of the neighbourhoods.

Robyns Airbnb is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.  Having access to the delightful garden is a wonderful bonus.  Robyn has thought of all the details that makes a stay in her home a memorable and luxurious stay."
1963074,465667754,6/8/2019,exceptionaly clean and comfortable
1963074,466343662,6/9/2019,We only spent one night here to be close to the airport and did not meet Robyn.  The space was perfect for our needs and would have been a good spot for basing to explore Dublin. It is a cozy bright space with beautiful gardens in the back with a patio.
1963074,468423862,6/12/2019,"Great location (bus stop is just outside the house, direct connection to Dublin City Center, yet in a tranquil  neighborhood), the room is modern and clean, nice terrace and garden."
1963074,469233793,6/14/2019,Robyn is absolutely lovely and made the start of our Ireland road trip a breeze. Her home is located conveniently near the airport and a bus stop right outside her door gets you to the city centre in 20mins (so easy!). Her place is sparking clean and the look out to the garden was so pretty (as was her cute little cat!). She provided fresh berries and yogurt for breakfast as well as coffee and tea. I highly recommend a stay here as the neighborhood is also very nice and quiet. She even offered a lift to the airport but we had already booked a taxi -- so kind! Thank you again for your lovely hospitality Robyn :)
1963074,469759858,6/15/2019,"Clean and modern. I didn't stay long in the place and left at 4.30am, however it was a pleasant stay. Nice and spacious room with everything you need. Bus to the city was just out side and less than 30 mins to the city. Recommended."
1963074,471360357,6/17/2019,Stayed here over the weekend and Robyns place did not disappoint! Everything from booking to actually leaving were faultless! Kitchen area as stated by previous guests is great-fresh milk in the fridge and really nice biscuits in the jar!! We met Robyn and she is the perfect host. With so many positive reviews you can be assured this is a first class rental. Mark and Cath June 2019.
1963074,473880832,6/22/2019,"Robyns place was wonderful. She is an excellent host. She provided us breakfast of cereals, yogurt, and other sorts of quick foods. She had coffee, tea, bottles of water, cookies, frozen waffles, and more for self catering. The room was sparkling clean, and the view out on the backyard was amazing. It was as good as Hawaii with all of the flowers blooming. The shower stall was a little bit small, but it was good water pressure and heated up instantly. There is not a place to sit and have breakfast inside, and if the weather is nice, the back patio has a table and some chairs. It is right next to the bus stop and easy to get into the city, but it is somewhat of a long ride. It wasnt problematic, so I would say this would be more excellent for somebody wanting to stay closer to the airport. The neighborhood was nice. I would definitely recommend this place and would return. Robyn seemed like a very kind, warm, helpful person. Thank you Robyn."
1963074,478836505,6/30/2019,"Beautiful room, beautiful back garden. Stylish, sparkling clean, and all the amenities.  I was doing a conference at DCU and this was a perfect stay. Robyn took great care of me. I would definitely recommend and come again."

We recommend Susans place.

1973276,444148026,4/27/2019,"This place is amazing, lots of space, great view and convenient location to stay outside of the temple bar area. But what makes this place extra special was the host, Susan. She goes above and beyond! She is so thoughtful and thinks of everything to make your stay comfortable.

1973276,455086995,5/19/2019,"Susan ist fabulous host who also did a very good job at designing the apartment without putting in the money for expensive designer furniture. If you need lots of space and prefer not to stay in the city center this apartment is nearly ideal. You have views into the Phoenix Park and an excellent pub nearby. But you must also know that the city center is a 15-minute-cab-ride away (which didn't bother us)¶ it is not posh, but very nice with a big living room and a fully equipped kitchen - Susan even put sausages and eggs and beer in the fridge¶"

It was my daughter's 21st birthday and we were heading on a day trip so we ordered a cake at the bakery near by (amazing!!) and Susan picked up the cake for us while we were out sightseeing that day.  So many special extra touches she did for us to make our stay more enjoyable.  (doing laundry, getting us ice, getting extra pots & pans for our dinners and so much more!)  And Robbie & Bob - talk about 2 great guys to take us wherever we needed to go!  I just can't say enough about how well we were treated.  We can't wait for our next trip back to Ireland.  The hospitality was beyond our expectations.  Also, the ""Hole in the Wall"" and ""Cumiskey's"" restaurants were so close and convenient.  Great food and Guinness everywhere!!  There were 12 of us - sometimes even 13 and we tend to be the ""loud family"" - we hope we weren't too much of a bother!  We now have new friendships with Susan, Robbie & Bob.  Phoenix Park out our back door was beyond beautiful... many long walks through the part and the Dublin Zoo was fun too!  It was a trip of a lifetime and Susan made it that much more enjoyable.  So many memories, laughs and funtimes.  Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!  Betsy & Crew xoxox"

2026810,434099347,4/7/2019,"Great house, great location, great host"
2026810,436175974,4/12/2019,Mary's place is lovely - perfect location and super homely house that really feels like a home away from home. Would highly recommend!
2026810,438342487,4/16/2019,"Very accurate to listing! Easy walk to town and cute area with lots of shops. Only would have wished to have a lock on my room, given there were a couple other travelers in the house during my stay. Given there was no safe, I felt a little worried about my expensive belongings/passport being left in my room. Though I felt safe and loved the space, it was in the back of my mind that anyone could enter my room at anytime if they chose to."
2026810,440208308,4/20/2019,"A no-fuss, fabulous and cosy Airbnb experience- was perfect!"
2026810,442421389,4/23/2019,"The house is located in a pleasant and dynamic area not far from the center of Dublin. It is very well served by the public transportation,  pharmacy, restaurants, supermarkets are at 2 minutes walk. Even though the house is large and very pretty, I wouldn't recommend it for travellers that like cleanliness and privacy (no keys to lock the room)"
2026810,445927886,4/30/2019,"Mary was a lovely host and the room was clean, quiet and the house was conveniently located. I highly recommend. :)"
2026810,448403478,5/5/2019,A lovely comfortable stay
2026810,452557618,5/13/2019,Nice spot for a private room. Close to the train & busses
2026810,453974514,5/17/2019,"Mary was a wonderful host, her home is so clean and well kept. Excellent location and so close to all public transport."
2026810,455776381,5/20/2019,"Mary is a lovely and very welcoming host. I highly enjoyed the chats we had together and she made me feel like at home immediately. The appartment is perfectly situated to reach city center in no time either by foot, bus or tram - that was very convenient."
2026810,473871387,6/22/2019,"Mary is a wonderful host. Perfectly and appropriately  communicative in each stage of the Airbnb experience. I lived there for 4 weeks - I walked to the centre of the City every day except for three - for those three I took the Luans - extremely convenient - 4 stops to St Stevens Green. Buses too are plentiful and frequent. And, no exaggeration  - many excellent restaurants / pubs / cafes / food shops within a few minutes walk - while also being on a quiet and friendly street. The best of all worlds! The bedroom was very comfortable - everything clean and ready for my arrival! This was an excellent experience for me from  every perspective.  Added bonus - Mary knows Ireland very well. !00% recommend Mary's Airbnb!"
2026810,477021528,6/27/2019,"Nice little room, ventilation of a building nearby was a bit noisy.

One can get to the city center by bus or luas very quick, but it also not far by foot."
2026810,479611428,7/1/2019,"Couldn't recommend this Air bnb enough. Very clean and quiet, Mary is a great host, replied to any queries very quickly. Ranelagh is the perfect location too, short walk or luas trip to the city Centre"
2026810,483246433,7/7/2019,"A very clean single bed bedroom and comfortable enough for single traveler. Good location, a step and a hop to transits both bus and tram. In a good day it would take you 15min to main tourist centre but prepare for traffic heading back. Mary is quick to response on any queries, thank you letting me stay at your place."
2026810,488604513,7/15/2019,Ranelagh is a great locationîcity Centre is easily accessible by foot or public transportation. Very reasonably priced
2026810,494372585,7/24/2019,I stayed at Mary's place for a few nights. The room was clean and nice as was the bathroom. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby and you walk about 25-30 minutes into the city center (St. Stephen's Green). Mary was a nice and friendly host.
2026810,513411770,8/19/2019,"My son and I were visiting Dublin for the first time, attending the World Science Fiction Convention at the massive futuristic Convention Centre. Mary's comfortable multi-level terrace house was ideal for us. The local area near Ranelagh has plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and bars. The local Tesco Express also came in handy. We found we could easily commute into the centre by using the modern tram system. You can purchase a 7 day Leaf travel card for 40 euros which allows travel by tram or bus, including the ride to and from the airport. Mary's place also provides handy and modern kitchen facilities so we were able to make our own breakfasts and usually an evening meal when we got back each day. All in all, a clean house reasonably priced in a good location."
2026810,514934613,8/22/2019,"The house is fantastic, great quirky style lovely, probably the cleanest Airbnb Ive ever stayed in. Location itself is close to a lot of nice cafes, bar/restaurants and supermarket amenities with bus routes and luas to the centre. Check-in was seamless too!"
2026810,520360943,8/30/2019,"Awesome location, and Mary is a phenomenal host!"
2026810,523365335,9/3/2019,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Mary's house.  Her instructions on check-in and house were very clear and made my stay easy.  She also takes an interest in her guests and is helpful in giving local suggestions regarding eating or any need.
2026810,525198304,9/7/2019,Nice apartment! Easy to get to the city center by train and bus! many shops and restaurants around the house. Mary also was very nice and kind!
2026810,527270711,9/10/2019,Mary is a very helpful woman. Verry friendly. In the Street are much Pubs and Restaurants. To the city center its just a short trip by the tram (10 min). Was a lovely trip to Dublin.

2026810,536814816,9/27/2019,Nice well-kept accommodation in a lively area of Dublin. Public transport and city center are within walking distance.
2026810,541518145,10/5/2019,"It was my first solo travel to Europe and Mary was an excellent addition to that trip. She was a great host! Very responsive and welcomed me at the door. She was great to talk to and had excellent recommendations and even better directions, for the directionally challenged like me. I didnt have any problems. The room was very cozy and very clean. The house was very quiet and I had no problems getting in and out. Great location, only 20 min by metro to city centre and a 2 minute walk to the metro station. One day I even decided to take the stroll and walk from city centre to the B&B, it took me about 30 min. Did not disappoint! Definitely would recommend to anyone on their trip to Dublin."
2026810,546977970,10/14/2019,Great stay. Very reasonably priced and well-suited for single travelers.
2026810,552274077,10/21/2019,Sehr nette und unkomplizierte Gastgeberin. Tolle Lage.

2026810,566395920,11/19/2019,"Lovely home, clean and very accessible to public transport. Didnt have a hard time commuting to and from airport and city center. Check-in process seamless as i arrived a bit late and she's not in the house. Mary is also considerate - she allowed me to leave my luggage post checkout. 5‚òÜ host. :))))"
2067000,421381957,3/9/2019,Great room near the city center. Highly recommended.
2067000,421873705,3/10/2019,"Johns place is very conveniently reachable via bus (city busses as well as a direct link to the airport) and everything was absolutel great.
The property and room is easily accessible, with the attached bathroom you also have some privacy and the king-sized bed was so comfy, that even my wife (who never sleeps too well in a bed thats not her own) had a good nights rest."
2067000,422492881,3/11/2019,"Great location if you want to be close to Aviva stadium. Very good directions to the house and how to access it. Bedroom was clean and tidy on arrival but the house was very cold. We had been caught in a snow/hail shower so a cold bedroom didn't add to our experience.  We asked John to put on the heating and he had no hesitation in doing this. Initial check in time given was 6 pm, this is very late,  we asked John for an earlier time, this was arranged without a problem. We booked this property because John had stated it was 700 metres from the 3 arena, he had made an error and it was a 35 minute walk to the 3 arena. John apologised but we wouldn't have booked this room if we had known its actual location. The living room is not available to residents which we respected, however somebody was playing musical instruments in the living room until around 1am. John is a pleasant person. This review is very different from all the others and can only assume it was an ""off"" day."
2067000,423864033,3/15/2019,Nice accomidation and great location. Highly recommend staying here and will love to stay there again next time were in Dublin
2067000,424914330,3/17/2019,"John was a great host and everything went smoothly. The room was clean and everything was as described.
The place is 30 minutes walk from City Center and it is very easy to go there either by bus or walking."
2067000,426559310,3/21/2019,Perfect!
2067000,428944845,3/26/2019,"I have stayed here on quite a few occasions now so have written previous reviews, all positive.  Pleased to say it's still a great place to stay if you want to be in fashionable Ballsbridge and John is always a pleasure to converse with."
2067000,429572039,3/28/2019,"Excellent place to stay. Clean, warm and a friendly host. Very close to amenities and great value for money."
2067000,430350974,3/30/2019,The room was really nice and in the great location. John is a great host!
2067000,430958170,3/31/2019,Lovely clean comfortable room and bed in excellent location.   Host was excellent and extremely responsive and so helpful.   Would recommend highly and will definately stay again.
2067000,432921949,4/5/2019,John communicated very well. We were just there for one night but it was great having a private bathroom in our room! Very comfy bed as well!
2067000,434109882,4/7/2019,Really convenient to the RDS exhibition spaces. Loads of good restaurants and pubs in the vicinity. Comfortable room with a good shower.
2067000,437861183,4/15/2019,"This is a cheap comfy room in a capital city, youth hostel style, a private room with a good bed and located opposite the football stadium, easy walk into the city or catch the bus.  Has an ensuite that does the job.  Great communication with John."
2067000,446420487,5/1/2019,"The good things about this listing:
- Beautiful neighbourhood.
- Very easy to get to town (bus stop a few meters away).
- Pubs and shops close by.
- Good lighting in the room, due to the big window/door to the patio.
- New and comfortable bed.
- The room is nicely decorated.
- Flexible check-in time. Very easy check-in process.

The bad things about this listing:
- The smell. 
- The towels were very old, stained and smelly. 
- The bed covers looked and smelled like they hadn't been washed in a while.
- We didn't get hand soap, shampoo/conditioner, hand towels. 
- We weren't offered coffee/tea/sugar, or other basic cooking items. 
- We didn't get a bit of space in the fridge to save our food. 
- The toilet didn't always flush properly, we had to keep a bucket in the bathroom. The cistern took a long time to fill as well.
- Communication with the host about the issues we were having."
2067000,447902419,5/4/2019,Definitely recommend!
2067000,450785353,5/10/2019,All good.... Great location near rail and bus.  Nice food within 200 meters.  Well appointed
2067000,453224435,5/15/2019,"John is a great host. 
With quick answers and great tips for dinner. the room it was great quiet clean, everything you need to rest from a working day or making tourism. 
I totally recommended!"
2067000,454062115,5/17/2019,"We had a pleasant experience here, and would recommend it to two travellers who might be on a budget. Check-in was easy and the place was accurate to the photos and description. The ensuite bathroom provided some privacy, and the place was clean. It is situated in a nice area, not too far from the city centre. Would definitely recommend."
2067000,456692968,5/22/2019,"Spot on and easy to follow directions to find the house (I also highly recommend the AirCoach is coming from Dublin Aerport). Access was just as described. Room, bed, and bathroom were perfect, clean, and ready for my arrival. Location is great; lots of good eating options just around the corner (suggest Crowes), near an ATM, very close bus stops.  Neighborhood felt very safe; I am a single older woman and returned on foot from a couple of miles away at 10 pm and felt perfectly safe.  Highly recommend!"
2067000,457151772,5/23/2019,Enjoyed my stay in Dublin! Very convenient location and comfortable bed. Liked having the private bathroom.
2067000,460507318,5/29/2019,"Really well located house, in a quiet neigbourhood, close to the beach and really easy to join the airport. The room is as expected when you look at the pictures, and clean. It was really easy to find the place with the informations that John gave us, and it was easy to checkin.
We only spent a night at John's house but the only problem that we had, is that the house isn't really isolated. We didn't expect to ear every little noise in the house. It was a problem for us, as we have a light sleep, it was really difficult to fall asleep at least before 1 am, as you ear people talks and even the TV. If it isn't a problem for you, the place is a good place for you to stay to visit Dublin !"
2067000,467966878,6/11/2019,Great place to stay- easy to get into town. John and jade are very helpful!
2067000,468324228,6/12/2019,We were only there overnight but found a cozy room off a sunny patio with en-suite. A nice neighborhood. John gave great easy to follow directions. Recommended.
2067000,468803834,6/13/2019,"John was a lovely host, and it was great staying at his place."
2067000,469228954,6/14/2019,Great place and great location! The room was very clean and comfortable.  I would happily stay at Johns place again. Highly recommend! Thank you.
2067000,470664880,6/16/2019,Johns place was the perfect location for us.  The room was exactly as described and check in was very smooth. We really appreciated John allowing us to drop of our bags early in the day.  Thanks a million.
2067000,471414791,6/17/2019,"Great location for anything going on at the RDS (only 5 mins walk).  Very private road with on street parking which was great for us.

John was very helpful throughout the booking process and couldnt help enough with any questions we had."
2067000,471876687,6/18/2019,Logement moyen.
2067000,472199299,6/19/2019,Excellent spot if you are attending the RDS. It's literally across the road. No Parking and it costs ‚Ç¨2.40an hour until 6pm on the street. Late check in and early leave. Bit expensive for what they are offering but the location is perfect so it's kinda worth it. Host not very responsive to messages.
2067000,476423525,6/26/2019,"Perfect place in beautiful Dublin. With Leapcard best place to explore Dubiln and suburbs and beaches. Gereat locations very nearby, more pubs or restaurants as mentioned, SPAR and TESCO  and interesting SKY-TV Locations. Embassies of US and GB nearby seem to be more safety. Bowling and Crocket in a nearby Herbert Park and ""AVIVA"" football stadium rachable by foot. PERFECT!"
2067000,478704468,6/30/2019,"Great room in a great location for exploring Dublin. Excellent value for money, lovely and clean a d easy to find. Would definitely stay here again."
2067000,481746174,7/5/2019,Stylish room a little outside of the city center. Great stay for a night and easy check in
2067000,483079992,7/7/2019,"John's house is situated in a good area - three pubs, a small SPAR for groceries and a pharmacy are only a two minute walk away. The bus stop is only a 4 minute walk away, you can reach the city in about 15 minutes (and get back on the night bus in 6 minutes).
John made sure we could drop off our bags at the time requested and use the room shortly after that which was great. John was able to give us recommendations for where to get the best food and drink which was much appreciated!
The bedroom and bathroom were nice and clean, the bed itself very comfortable. The room has direct access to the small patio which is really nice if the weather is right.
The only down-side (in our opinion) is that the house has - so to say - paper-thin walls so we were hearing the doors getting shut as well as the noises from the room and bathroom next door."
2067000,485775028,7/11/2019,"Johns place has such a unique-artsy feel! The location was perfect. A coffee joint, bar and pizza place are right around the corner.  The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. A perfect place for young couples or single travelers."
2067000,488717570,7/15/2019,"Awesome location in Ballsbridge. Unfortunately, the space was lacking in cleanliness and listed amenities. John was very kind and helpful, so the issues we experienced may have just been a one-off thing."
2067000,498112552,7/29/2019,"Great location, awesome host and really good value. Highly recommended."
2067000,500030826,8/1/2019,"We stayed for 3 nights and everything was perfect. It's not luxury,  but it was nice.
The room was clean and having our own bathroom allowed us to get up really early for tours we booked without bothering everyone( I hope.. we tried to be quiet :D)  The location was terrific and easy to get into the city center. We went to the local and everyone were nice to us.. which is a plus.
The room was clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable.
We felt safe in an unfamiliar city and we loved the neighborhood. So cute.
we will recommend to friends."
2067000,501135462,8/3/2019,Lovely room in a great location. Nice and quiet but with good selection of local places and easy access to central Dublin.
2067000,505330757,8/9/2019,We didn't actually meet John but he replied to messages really quickly. The room was exactly as described and perfect for our trip as we only wanted somewhere to sleep....the bed was comfortable.
2067000,506922556,8/11/2019,Very comfortable and excellent location.
2067000,509267880,8/14/2019,Great place with lots of local amenities. John let us park in his gated parking and we taxied into town
2067000,514032284,8/20/2019,"Great room if you only need a room for staying a night or to. Not the place to stay if you need a place to be longer time of the day. You basically have bed, a cheer, a bathroom and that is it. As this was all I needed I did have a great stay. John was always quick to respond to me contacting him."
2067000,515108205,8/22/2019,"Thank you for opening up your home to us, John. We really appreciated how helpful you were when we were in a bind. We waited too long to book accommodation for Foo Fighters in the RDS and when a friend suggested that we try Johns AirBnB we just went for it. We were not disappointed and I can happily say that we will be staying again soon. The room was spotless, the atmosphere was chilled and we got a great night of sleep in our quiet corner room. Thanks again and keep up the great work! :D"
2067000,516360293,8/24/2019,"Great host! John was able to give us lots of useful information, to make the most of our short stay and was extremely flexible and helpful in accommodating us when we had problems with our flights! Thanks John!"
2067000,517290724,8/25/2019,"I would say nice place, you can go to the city center by public transport easily."
2067000,519869914,8/29/2019,A bit far out from town centre but wonderful if you like walking. Its about a 30 minute walk. Many restaurants and conveniences near by. Lovely and quiet neighbourhood and we felt very safe walking around after dark.
2067000,524592622,9/6/2019,Great location & good stay
2067000,526045577,9/8/2019,"John was quick to answer any questions and his unit was very convenient to and from the airport. A comfortable,clean, and quiet room."
2067000,527263823,9/10/2019,Safe & quiet neighborhood. About a 30 min walk to Dublin city center. Very easy check in.
2067000,527652959,9/11/2019,Perfect for trips to the Aviva stadium with pubs and restaurants minutes away no frills does exactly what it says on the tin
2067000,528641414,9/13/2019,"Johns place was great! He got off early the day we arrived to accommodate us coming in early from a long long long day of flights-that was more than we expected him to do! The room was great, quiet, and had a lot of character! I especially loved the bed-so comfy! It was close to a few restaurants (within walking distance) and very close to a bus stop which was really nice. We had a great time in Dublin!"
2067000,530745877,9/16/2019,A great room in a lovely house. Very friendly hosts. A short stroll to many restaurants and pubs and a handy Spar. The only downside for me was that the description says there is free parking and there isn't. I found a parking space on the street but I had to be out on the street at 8am the next day to buy a parking ticket. The machine wouldn't accept payment the night before. The house is in a gated courtyard and you need to punch in a code every time you go in or out. Memorise this code! Otherwise you'll end up going back in for your phone like I did!
2067000,533238040,9/21/2019,"friendly host, quick response, easy check in, great location close to center and transport means."
2067000,535894731,9/25/2019,"Great location, quiet and central."

2067000,537337263,9/28/2019,"I spent one night here and apart from having a hard time finding John's house (but I am older and it was probably my ineptness!), it was totally as expected. A good place for me to drop my head for the night, and there is a nice hotel nearby for breakfast."
2067000,539436139,10/1/2019,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at John's. It is in a great location (30 minute walk to city center) very safe, clean and close to amenities. John is very welcoming and had a great sense of humour. Would certainly stay with him again!"
2067000,544445504,10/10/2019,"Johns place was everything we needed for a quiet place close to everything we needed :)
Check in was easy and bus to airport was just a few steps away."
2067000,547000776,10/14/2019,"Can highly recommend to stay with John. 4/5 stars because the heating only worked at day. So a little chilly at night. Besides that, perfect stay"
2067000,548266308,10/17/2019,"John was not in town during my stay, but I managed OK by myself."
2067000,553970530,10/25/2019,Lovely space. So close to all the amenities and public transport. Very comfortable!
2067000,555843804,10/28/2019,John's place is in a great location and very reasonably priced. Would recommend
2067000,559602834,11/4/2019,"Easy to check in , out , very close to RDS . If you go to RDS , the best location. Highly recommend."
2067000,561001470,11/8/2019,"Lovely ensuite room, heating was on, so we were lovely and warm. Towels, shower gel and shampoo all included. Comfy bed and pillows. No hassle getting keys etc."
2069629,422580358,3/11/2019,This is a great apartment in a fantastic location. Very close to almost everything in the city. Michelle is fantastic and very easy to work with.
2069629,431570836,4/1/2019,"Beautiful Apartment-Perfect Location!

This was my 4th visit to Dublin; I usually stay near St Stephens Green.  However, this was my boyfriends first trip & I wanted him to have the chance to be in the heart of it all!
The apartment is less than a 2 minute walk from the HaPenny Bridge (North Side) and about a 5 minute walk from the AirLink bus stop on OConnell Street.  
Michelles  check in/check out instructions were spot on, no issues whatsoever.
The bed was so comfortable, and we really appreciated the plentiful towels!  The shower pressure was fabulous.

We had one minor issue (which was beyond Michelles control) as the WiFi was not working when we arrived.  I notified Michelle and she had it replaced by the next day. To me that is a sign of an excellent host! Things can and do go wrong, and how the host handles those situations is what is important. 
We would not hesitate to stay here again. Thanks again Michelle for wonderful accommodations!

2069629,437211628,4/14/2019,Nice little place. Clean. Location is perfect for doing tourist things. The bed is firm and comfortable. I recommend it.
2069629,440189546,4/20/2019,"We had a wonderful week-long stay at Michelle's apartment.  As many other reviewers noted, the location is perfect!  We especially enjoyed The Lotts Pub at the corner (the Snug Bar was our favorite), and Butler's Chocolates for coffee in the morning.   The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a great stay.  The bed was very comfortable, too!  Great place; highly recommend."
2069629,448367104,5/5/2019,"great hot shower, amazing comfortable bed.. great location.. can be loud at times.. but so central.. just bring earplugs for sleeping and you'll be fine"
2069629,468832549,6/13/2019,Very close to the City Centre but not as happy with the street it was on due to noise outside the window. Michelle was very helpful and fast at responding.

2120571,424221049,3/16/2019,Responsive host!
2120571,425925031,3/19/2019,Agreat location and a very comfortable stay.
2120571,427261698,3/23/2019,"Lovely, spacious and bright flat. Siobhan and Kevin responded quickly so communication was easy. Just a point of caution: the AirBnB map sent too far down the road so watch out and if you cross the small pedestrian bridge, you've gone too far. "
2120571,428582705,3/25/2019,Great 2 double bed apartment is a nice area not too far out of the city centre. Siobhan was a great host/contact when we had slight issues with getting in and in the lead up to arriving. Lovely open kitchen/lounge which is especially beautiful when the sun was shining. The two bedrooms were beautifully decorated and the main bathroom had all the amenities required for a couple days trip. Overall our group was really pleased to have found Siobhans apartment for our weekend getaway.
2120571,430339070,3/30/2019,"Clean and cozy flat with many rooms for four people, the late check-in worked without any problems. No personal contact to the host but there was fast communication most of the time. A good place to visit Dublin!"
2120571,434029079,4/7/2019,"First time in Dublin and we loved it. The apartment was very stylish with very comfortable beds and lovely warm showers. The walk to the centre was a little longer than expected (about 40 mins) so we ended up getting Ubers but with a group the cost wasnt so bad. Local shop down the road was very handy. Overall nothing to complain about really, we enjoyed the stay, thanks for having us!"
2120571,440946327,4/21/2019,"Great apartment to explore Dublin!
Also very convenient with children, as there is a dishwasher and a washing machine for clothes and enough space. Well equipped and there is a small shop just around the corner.
Comunication with Siobhan and her husband was very good!
We would recommend it!"
2120571,443592423,4/26/2019,"Nice apartment in a quiet area a bit less downtown but bus nearby, convenient neighborhood grocery. Very comfortable bed ideal for 4 people to discover Dublin these museums and its Pubs"
2120571,446375034,5/1/2019,Nice apartment within  12 minutes walk from various bus stations.  Kitchen is well equipped. The surrounding area is quite. No annoyance from neighbors. Even good Wifi  and television with Netflix.
2120571,448636304,5/5/2019,Wonderful apartment with great location and a view. Everything went really smoothly with Siobhan and Kevin.
2120571,455790488,5/20/2019,"A very comfortable apartment not too far from city center: a 10 minutes walk station Drumcondra, 15 min ride to city center.  Only a few local restaurants and grocery markets.   The apartment is well supplied with bathroom paper, shampoos and conditioners, body wash, etc.   Beds were very comfortable and we loved the Netflix.  The 2-in-1 washer-dryer was very handy after ten days on a cruise.  But it is tricky to operate, took more than 3 hrs to wash and dry.   If you are from Canada or USA, an AC adaptor is a must to use our own electronic devices.   Overall, we enjoyed the stay."
2120571,458012036,5/25/2019,"Great place to stay, easy check in and check out would highly recommend"
2120571,474559625,6/23/2019,"Great place, very clean and comfortable. Recommend to anyone."
2120571,479737612,7/1/2019,"Siobhan's place is conveniently located in the nice Drumcondra area. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to local pubs and restaurants. Be aware that it is very near the massive GAA sports complex so the area is very crowded and congested on match days. All local pubs are packed on those days as well. Check the calendar. You can easily walk to City Centre in 35-45 minutes as well. The flat is in a larger building with a mix of full-time residents and other short-term guests. The unit is mostly well-stocked, but if you plan to cook you will need to provision with any spices, etc you may need. It does not appear anyone lives in the unit full-time. While other reviews mention the comfort of the beds, both my travel companion and I found them too hard/too firm for our taste. We also had an issue with window blinds being broken, which was inconvenient given the long daylight hours of the time of year. Siobhan assured us the blinds would be replaced, but it was unable to happen during our stay."
2120571,489237883,7/16/2019,The apartment is walking distance between 2 major bus routes making it easy to get anywhere in Dublin quite quickly. And it is just far enough out of the downtown to be a quiet retreat from the hustle of Dublin. It has everything you need for a great visit of Dublin.
2120571,506234585,8/10/2019,"Siobhans flat is lovely. The location is great and is about a 20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. We really appreciated how clean the place was. Oh, and the beds are comfy."
2120571,523320650,9/3/2019,You will have a fantastic time with excellent eating places at a short walk from the apartment.
2120571,524100216,9/5/2019,"Great venue and location in Dublin
 Close to pubs and great food. Two bedroom spacious apartment. Will definitely return."
2120571,526707348,9/9/2019,"Beatifully arranged, very clean and cosy apartment. Ideal to stay in at a Dublin visit. Fits perfectly for 4 persons. Walking distance to city center and also close to the airpiort. I can fully recommend!"
2120571,527164394,9/10/2019,"Fun apartment to stay in which is in close proximity to downtown Dublin, restaurants,  and nightlife. Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin."
2120571,529219814,9/14/2019,"L'arribada va ser complicada.
Falten estris a la cuina. 
Hi ha estris de cuina inservibles."
2120571,535354082,9/24/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Siobhans place. It was very clean and had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The beds were very comfortable and the condo is quiet. Its a bit of a walk into downtown Dublin. (About 30 minutes) however, there is a bus stop down the street if you are not up for walking.  We chose to walk and always felt very safe.
The one thing to note is you need to call when you first get there to get buzzed in before you have keys. For our group we try and travel without using our phones in non WiFi areas to help reduce expenses on our cell phones. We had to be sure someone could make that phone call which cost a bit extra on our cell phone plan. It wasnt a huge issue, just something to note. 
I would highly recommend this condo. The price was great for being close to the city."
2120571,536721694,9/27/2019,Excellent location for Croagh Park and lovely apartment.
2120571,544944782,10/11/2019,Lovely apartment for a stay in Dublin with a good equipped kitchen.
2120571,547970539,10/16/2019,Very nice apartment
2120571,555204899,10/27/2019,"A very clean, comfortable, and quiet place to stay.   Nicely located near Croke Park."
2120571,563289641,11/12/2019,"The place was nice and relatively roomy for a two bedroom.  The beds were moderately comfortable but the furniture was dated. The common areas were kept clean. 
While it is far from most things it was handy to have a convenience store right on the corner."
2142451,486264722,7/12/2019,"Carl's home is beautiful, bright, colourful, clean, fresh and has a marvellous little garden. It's situated a bus trip from the centre of Dublin 25-45 min depending on the traffic. The room and bed are very comfy. There's a big wardrobe with drawers to use. Plenty of space for everything. I'm a bit allergic and had no problems with that whatsoever. No wall to wall carpets and no strong perfumes. 

I've saved the best for last: Carl is such an awesome person. So welcoming, kind and helpful. I enjoyed great conversation, suggestions about what to do and see in Dublin, a relaxed athmosphere that made me feel 'at home' immediately. I've had the best 2 weeks in Dublin and I would love to come back and stay with Carl again in the future."
2142451,530091452,9/15/2019,"Carl is a very polite and friendly host. It was a really comfortable residence, in particular in view of the small price. All in all even much better than Ive expected!"
2146858,422854283,3/12/2019,"A very convenient place if youre looking for a quiet and safe environment, yet great for visiting both the city and its surroundings."
2146858,428516128,3/25/2019,"Even though we had a  good time in dublin and Peter is a very interesting and kind guest, I feel that you should be aware at booking that you will be sleeping on the floor due to the fact that if you have back issues that matress would be unsuitable for you. Rather than that the flat was alright and dublin is a very nice city. Cheers"
2146858,471409223,6/17/2019,"The first thing I want to say is that Momo is very nice, kind and ready to help. I had to clean the previous guest stuff because she couldnt check me in and gave me the instructions to do it, and she gave me the cleaning fee back.
I had the whole house for me. Its close to RDS Stadium, supermarket, pubs...all walking distance.
The only huge problem for me its that is a place unbearable dirty. I felt very uncomfortable because of this.
But all the rest was great.
Thanks Momo!"
2146858,474728111,6/23/2019,"Hi, my boyfriend and I passed two good nights in this home. Peter is really kind, we are however a little disappointed by the lack of attention by Yi Chang. But she had work, it happens and we respect that. Then concerning the accommodation itself it is a bit far from the city center, Dublins transport are very expensive so we preferred to walk, which took us minimum 30min to reach the center. The room and the bathroom were very small, as expected, but enough to sleep a weekend. On the other hand the kitchen remains small and not very usable. Otherwise, we recommend this accommodation for a short stay, the price is correct."
2146858,497327779,7/28/2019,"As per the description, the facilities are on the basic side, but it's a great location on a quiet road near to Central Dublin with everything you could need. And Yi Ching is a very welcoming host."
2146858,521019277,8/31/2019,"The Place is exactly like described. if you are looking for a GREAT location,  Sandymount is the place. the walks to the beach and the city streets are great for chilling after a long working day. Peter is an Awesome guys and very helpful. all you need with this couple is to respect the calmness of the place.  i was able to stay there for a full month. the room is not so comfy, yes, but one can make anyplace a home they want to.

I was so happy to have stayed there. this place helped me a lot with my move to Dublin, and Peter sure is a great GREAT guy.

I really recommend this place for one person. if  that person is willing to walk/bike around and willing to respect the place's quiet environment just like the couple who lives there respects your privacy.

Simply, if you want fancy and  willing to stay in your place throughout the day, you better pay 200 Euros in a hotel... this place is great for smart travelers  who prefer spending their days exploring and living outside and heading back to eat, shower, rest a bit ans sleep.

Sam"
2146858,527583423,9/11/2019,"Great location for attending a match at the Aviva Stadium, with the dart close by"
2146858,560321461,11/6/2019,Super friendly and helpful hosts. Its a cute and cozy place in a nice neighborhood. My colleague and I were on a work trip and it was super convenient for us. Thanks and hope to see you guys again!
2154635,425423616,3/18/2019,"Firstly, the host is really nice and helpful and received us when we checked in.
But that was the only good thing about the place. The house itself is in poor condition and needs a renovation before it can be rented to the guests.
The main door lock was jammed and it took forever each time to get inside the house. We had to keep trying in the cold to get it to open.
There are no lock in the room or bathrooms.

The other thing is that the flush does not work. Sometimes it did and sometimes it did not. The shower is also hazardous and the glass is loosely fit. The towel rails in the bathroom are all broken. The blinds are also in horrible condition.

Also, there is NO breakfast in the house.
I paid extra for this place for that feautre but it was not there."
2154635,466361754,6/9/2019,Kate's place is in a great location if you are going to the 3 Arena for a concert. only a short walk. it has easy access to the tramway service as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the area was!
2154635,535447200,9/24/2019,East Wall neighbourhood of terraced rows surviving despite development of modern blocks. Easy transit from airport bus and supermarkets nearby. Tram or bus to town easy.  Lovely lived in feel. Would return.

2164444,419930208,3/5/2019,"Ben's place was extremely clean, spacious and private! Ben was great at communicating and even allowed us to drop off our stuff prior to check in so we could begin exploring Dublin! We had a great experience!"
2164444,421841903,3/10/2019,"Nice, private floor with spacious bedroom and (small) bathroom for ourselves. Check in was good and response to questions for local bar and restaurant suggestions were fast and helpfull. Nice walk from the accomodation through St. Stephens Green towards the city centre!"
2164444,425852848,3/19/2019,Ben was especially accommodating with arrival times and checkout.

2164444,437256303,4/14/2019,"Great location, great value for money, perfect little space, lovely little additions e.g. water, chocolate, tea bags and milk for our arrival. Just short of some sugar then my tea would have been perfect! Many thanks for a great stay"
2164444,439584139,4/19/2019,"This place is in an awesome location! We found some great places to eat nearby, and its a nice walking distance to St Stephens Green and Grafting Street. Same with restaurants and a convenience store. 
I read prior reviews saying the bathroom was small, and I agree- its tiny.  Previous guests mentioned that the shower head was low, so it was hard to shower if youre tall. Im 510ù, and could adjust the height of the shower enough, but its also just a really narrow shower. We also had to step into the shower to close the bathroom door. 
Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. The bed was comfy, the small kitchenette was very convenient, and as I said the location was awesome!"
2164444,441879910,4/22/2019,"Our stay at bens House was Nice. Good located to explore the city. 
His mom and his brother welcomed us VERY friendly. There were enough adapter for all our chargers in the room , also the small fridge is very usefull. Our flight back home was very late, but we could leave our laguage in the house and come back whenever we had to! Thanks a lot!"
2164444,444157372,4/27/2019,Bens place is a perfect location to walk into Dublin. A nice spacious bedroom which is quiet.
2164444,447939016,5/4/2019,Great location. Very clean and private .
2164444,451145648,5/11/2019,"Listing is exactly as described. Spacious, clean and very private area in a lovely house. Communication was first class, and checkin very easy (due to a lockbox) despite arriving and departing at some pretty antisocial hours!"
2164444,452909159,5/14/2019,Great location and place!
2164444,454053534,5/17/2019,"I always read the reviews and discount the odd rogue one. However, I have to agree with Tibi Jan 19. The apartment felt neglected despite the entrance and house looking stylish and immaculate. The heating was not an issue due to the time of year and the bed/bedding was fine.

The bathroom had not been cleaned between visitors and when I requested that it was, nothing noticable changed. The tiled walls and corners showed that the space needed a proper spring clean. We went on to stay somewhere else in Ireland where it was acknowledged that the facilities would not be pristine and this was reflected in the price. Its all about expectations.

The place is very convenient for the bus to and from the airport and is in a good area. We did a lot of walking and ate in the city centre, early evening, on the walk home so we didnt have to walk in again. This meant we came back to the apartment mid evening. There was only one armchair to sit in, so not very comfortable.

We were very grateful to be able to drop off our bags before the room was ready and the instructions were good. 

As everyone points out we did not meet Ben. It felt as if he was a student living elsewhere and letting out his room at home, without feeling the need to provide a quality experience. The apartment was functional but not the treat we were expecting for the price."
2164444,455216114,5/19/2019,Beautifully decorated space that is very private. It was very clean and quiet. I loved the kitchenette with a washing machine. Its an easy 25 minute walk to Grafton street and Trinity college. There seemed to be plenty of bus stops but we never figured it out- we prefer to park and walk everywhere. The area is cute and had several restaurants. There is a small grocery/convenience store near by where we got breakfast items.
2164444,457101817,5/23/2019,"Ben's place is perfectly located just on the edge of the city. We enjoyed exploring the local area and adjoining suburb of Rathmines as well as along the canal. The airport bus stop is conveniently located close by. Although there is a bus stop a few metres up the road, we chose to stroll into the city each day, returning via a different route each day and enjoying one of the many pubs near our accommodation for dinner each evening. The location is very quiet ensuring a good night's sleep!"
2164444,458048870,5/25/2019,Lovely BnB within walking distance from town. We enjoyed our stay and slept well!
2164444,461344319,5/31/2019,"Bens home was excellent from outside and in. The Georgian style exterior is gorgeous. The interior is fantastic with a nice bedroom with Apple TV kitted out with Netflix etc. The kitchen is ideal with great amenities. The bathroom is perhaps a bit small but is lovely too. 
The check in is ideal and location is good if a wee bit far away if intending to walk everywhere. Walk to the main town is a reasonable distance but very do able. 
The only issues were with some cleanliness but these were very minor. Overall had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend to other guests!"
2164444,462686529,6/2/2019,"This apartment suited our needs ideally and provides comfortable accommodation at significantly lower cost than hotels in this stylish district of Dublin. 

The apartment has the amenities one might require for a short stay in Dublin and the location is excellent with a high-quality convenience store close at hand, public transportation available from the street or nearby, and the city centre within walking distance.

Visitors with restricted mobility should note that this is a basement apartment so stairs and the compact bathroom may raise issues of access. This was absolutely not a problem for us and I only mention it to guide others; we would definitely look to stay with Ben on future visits to Dublin."
2164444,469728478,6/15/2019,"Lovely place to stay.
Lots of info given about local area. 
Great neighbourhood.
Cosy feel. 
TV a little small and the remotes felt a little sticky, but did the job (Netflix available).
Cool decor.
Very squeaky bed but super comfy. 
Upmarket and safe area.
Good facilities nearby (local shops and cafes). 
No locks on the door from the main house to the basement but the front door to the house was secure. 
Plenty of plug sockets.
Small kitchen and bathroom, however they have what you need.
Although we didn't meet the host, he was very helpful and gave us all the info we needed, including a contact number if we needed any assistance. 

PERFECT LOCATION!!!!!!!!! 
Bus stop right outside the house to get to anywhere you want to go. 
Would definitely recommend and will stay again if I go back to Dublin. 
Thanks for having us!"
2164444,472292170,6/19/2019,"Bens place is in a great location just 20 minutes walk to the heart of Dublin. Great to have parking on site. Super easy check in and an overall great experience in his downstairs bedroom. Nice to have the kitchenette to save some money with making breakfast ourselves. And very responsive with all my questions I had, thanks again Ben we'd be glad to come back!"
2164444,474501929,6/23/2019,"Great location, comfortable, effortless!"
2164444,478119785,6/29/2019,The space is in a great area in Dublin - more residential however an easy walk to the city center.  It's a lovely apartment and worked perfectly for me and my daughter.
2164444,479593757,7/1/2019,Great location - quiet neighbourhood and close to sites downtown. Easy check in.
2164444,481223013,7/4/2019,Not quite as it seems
2164444,488583771,7/15/2019,About a 20-30 minute walk to the city center. Safe neighborhood. Nice to have the whole basement to ourselves.
2164444,494902991,7/25/2019,"A beautiful setting in a great location for exploring the city. The apartment had lots of information, local recommendations and finishing touches that made us feel at home."
2164444,497214896,7/28/2019,"Eine nette kleine Unterkunft mit einem noch kleineren Bad, doch es hat uns an nichts gefehlt."
2164444,502921828,8/5/2019,"The appartment is situated in a great area with the bus stop very close by but if you wish to do so, you can walk into the City Centre as well. This should take you About 15 to 20 minutes. We did not meet Ben in person but the communication with him via Email was very friendly and he answered all of our questions in a polite and swift manner. We did however meet his Mum Sally who was very friendly and did her very best to insure that we would have a lovely stay.
 The appartment is exactly as it is pictured online, if not nicer. You do however have to be aware of the fact that the bathroom and especially so the shower are quite small, so if you are rather tall you might have difficulties standing up straight. This can be seen in the Pictures but we wanted to let you know anyhow. We would definitely recommend Ben¬¥s Airbnb if you are looking to spend a couple of nights in the lovely City of Dublin. But a longer stay might prove difficult since you cannot really cook in the appartment."
2164444,504906928,8/8/2019,We took a cab there then bused around town. The location was close to the bus stop
2164444,513404796,8/19/2019,Bens place is quite cozy and only a short walk away from the center of Dublin. We very much enjoyed our stay.

2164444,526798698,9/9/2019,"Great location a lovely warm feel to this home,
You can walk, bus, taxi, into the city.
Local shops, coffee etc"
2164444,529095539,9/14/2019,"The location is great, walking distance to center of Dublin, grocery store across the street and great local pub just one block away,  

Cleanliness was ok, a bit tired.  Be sure there are enough towels during your stay."
2164444,539839502,10/2/2019,"Room nice  close to city got everything you need.
Thanks host."
2164444,546221270,10/13/2019,"Fantastic location, close to fun bars, pubs and the city centre, as well as being really easy to get to from the airport. The room itself almost feels separate from the rest of the house, with a private bathroom and little kitchenette. The check in and out was really easy, and Ben is very quick to answer any questions and is really helpful. Would recommend!"
2164444,551538031,10/20/2019,"Location is better than it looked on a map, very close to bus routes to and from the airport and an easy twenty minutes or so walk to the downtownù area. This is more a base for visiting Dublin than a place to relax in. The  very small kitchenette is adequate for tea, toast and microwave but little else. Has Apple TV which may be good for regular users but was not for us."
2164444,555903873,10/28/2019,Very nice room clean and comfortable close to city center would stay again
2165074,440881102,4/21/2019,"Cynthia's apartment was lovely and clean, it had plenty of space and everything you needed for a comfortable stay. She had all the necessary things needed including some food and tolietry items. The location was close to bus stations and supermarkets and not far from the airport. The areas surrounding the apartment building didn't feel entirely safe, the surrounding building itself had smashed glass and graffiti on some doors. 
The apartment it's self was good to stay in if you will be doing day trips and home at night."
2165074,483228373,7/7/2019,Enjoyed our stay at Cynthia's place. Lot of space to sleep and good beds. We also watched a movie using the installed beamer. Great!
2165074,497119446,7/28/2019,"Stayed at Cynthias apartment for 5 nights. Clean, comfy and Cynthia is very easy to contact. Lucas was there to meet us by the time we were checking  in. No problem at all. Plus points are the home cinema which my husband and son enjoyed at night time and the desktop which is very handy for me doing my work. There are convenient stores near the area. Overall, we had a great time!"
2232124,433310167,4/6/2019,"This cosy upstairs airbandb is located close enough to Dublin for easy access by car or public transit, yet it is on a quiet street with an ocean view. It is also close to the beautiful seaside areas of Howth and Malahide. The place is well equipped with many thoughtful extras like a toaster, kettle and coffee maker and a little stocked fridge with delicious yogurt, water etc. The two separate rooms are perfect for a small family or individuals travelling together who want their own privacy. The beds are comfortable and have good quality, warm duvets. Everything was spotlessly clean. Dee was a wonderful host to make us feel at home."
2232124,438645014,4/17/2019,"Great place that I would definitely recommand.
Deirdre is really kind and accomodating.
It's nice to have your own floor for some privacy but still you're in Deirdre's home which is also nice because she instantly makes you feel at home.
Great view of the sea through the window, good location, nice beds, nice bathroom and nice breakfast: thanks a lot Dee!"
2232124,441910953,4/22/2019,Amazing place with beautiful views and great facilities but most of all we appreciated Deirdres kindness and personal attention in welcoming us into her lovely home and treating us like family.

2232124,447289252,5/3/2019,"Dees home was more amazing than even described and her hospitality is unmatched to all others. She let us check in earlier since our flight was an early one, worked with me when I incorrectly booked the date for our home, and was just overall  a wonderful host. She also provided a filling breakfast in addition to water bottles and coffee- all with a beautiful view of the water. Im so glad we found her place and would highly recommend to anyone else looking in the area."
2232124,455805984,5/20/2019,"Such a delightful home that I hope will become a base whenever I am back on the north side of Co. Dublin. Comfortable and spacious, and Deirdre was exceptionally thoughtful and gracious as a host. The last Airbnb in a two-week+ tour of Ireland that included a castle and an alpaca farm and this was still one of the very best. Highly recommend."

2251284,558916538,11/3/2019,"My friends and I had the most amazing time in Dublin, it was so easy to stay in Keith' place. The location was great, only a 15/20 minute walk into the city centre (Temple Bar area) and everywhere else we wanted to go. We arrived into Dublin late, got to the apartment late but it was so easy to let ourselves in with the lock box. Keith gave us excellent recommendations before we arrived and we loved the city itself. Would recommend this house for location/ value - there is a sofa bed to make it suitable for 4 but for 2 nights we really didn't mind and found the house comfortable/ cosy."

2283713,436517260,4/13/2019,"The listing is exactly as Daragh describes. My mom and I stayed for 2 nights. Its super close to St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, and Trinity College. We had easy access to everything and there are tons of restaurants & stores along his road as well. It does get pretty loud on the street at night due to the many pubs that are around. We brought ear plugs though & used a white noise app on our phones and had no issue going to sleep. Daragh is very nice & hospitable and we enjoyed staying there."
2283713,438733806,4/17/2019,"Daragh was really nice, showed me in the map all city and gave me some tips. The flat is really comfortable and everything was clear. Also, the flat is in a great localization, close to all touristic points."

2283713,467912794,6/11/2019,"Daragh is very polite and quick to help with local maps and suggestions, or anything else you may require.

2283713,470439138,6/16/2019,"Great value, close to transit. Would definitely return!"
2283713,472286893,6/19/2019,"Daragh is an amazing host.  He was so helpful and accommodating.  His home is gorgeous, that of an artist, with a beautiful relaxed and welcoming vibe.  My daughter and I loved our stay.  The location is brilliant!!! We will definitely stay there any time we are in Dublin!  I highly recommend booking with Daragh."

2283713,486200204,7/12/2019,"Pros: Great location for a night or two as you are right in the centre of Dublin so no time wasted travelling. Some most interesting art features in the apartment! Friendly and helpful host in Daragh.

Cons: One bathroom for 4 - 6 adults; a most uncomfortable hideabed - we had to sleep head to toe for each to be comfortable enough to sleep; noisy with traffic sounds pretty much all night î perhaps to be anticipated in this location, but Im kind of surprised that this was not a main comment in other reviews. 

All in all - for the price, an acceptable place to spend a night or two in Dublin."
2283713,489283857,7/16/2019,"A nice small room in a great location, its perfect for a short city trip. Pubs and restaurants are really close by, therefore it can get a bit loud in the room."
2283713,491588120,7/20/2019,Good place if you can deal with the noise on the street at night. It is extremely loud but I had ear plugs so that allowed me to sleep. Daragh is quick to communicate and has lots of info and tips for travelers.

2283713,519790369,8/29/2019,"I recommend Daraghs place. The location couldnt be better. There are tons of restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores on the street in front of the apartment. Theres an express bus to the airport right in front of the apartment as well and it takes 45mins door to door. Hes great at communicating with thorough instructions on how to get into the apartment and use all of the keys. Daragh is friendly and warm. We had a nice time chatting with him."
2283713,528464380,9/13/2019,Camden is a very cool neighbourhood and Daragh is a very friendly accommodating fellow.

We enjoyed the pubs around.
Thank you Daragh!"
2283713,531848992,9/18/2019,"Daragh's home is exactly as described. The room is comfortable and cozy. The location is amazing and Daragh is a wonderful host.

2291390,425483539,3/18/2019,"Most INCREDIBLE location! This is right in the heart of Temple Bar District - best part, a mere minute walk from the best bar EVER, Bad Bobs. Send Bad Bobs. *Note though however, there was no Wifi."
2291390,428935837,3/26/2019,Heel centraal gelegen
2291390,446868085,5/2/2019,Amazing... unbelievable quality and location for the price. Very fast responses and worked with me on extending past my check out day. Recommend to anyone coming to temple bar... its been loads of fun

2291390,470578384,6/16/2019,"The location is incredible if you are looking for somewhere close to everything and easily accessible. Great if youre just looking for a place to crash at night. However, aside from the great location and accessibility, the flat itself is really barebones and a bit rundown."
2291390,472203587,6/19/2019,Great location.
2291390,474455873,6/23/2019,Nice apartment for visit and party in Dublin
2291390,477964499,6/29/2019,"Pros:
Brent was a fantastic host, offered some great recommendations and was really quick to respond. The location is fantastic if you're looking for a short stay within the temple bar area and everything was within walking distance.

Cons:
No WiFi or TV, but there's plenty of WiFi in bars nearby! The place could have done with a good clean."
2291390,484224538,7/8/2019,This is a great location! We were able to easily walk everywhere we wanted to go and for being in such a busy area it is not too loud at night. Brent was responsive to our questions and gave great recommendations for food and drinks!
2291390,492524309,7/21/2019,"Overall, the place was great! The location was the best part! We were a 2-3 minute walk from Temple bar and the nightlife! Everything else was only 10 minutes in any direction! There was great food nearby, too."
2291390,499891857,8/1/2019,Great location.
2291390,508185937,8/12/2019,"Overall is OK, but washing bedsheets and towels is recommended before using them."
2291390,520337887,8/30/2019,"We really enjoyed staying in this flat. It was clean and right next to Temple Bar! As 20-somethings it was reasonable for us. The elevator was an added bonus

However, there is a strip club nearby. We didnt notice really - no noise or sketchy people. But I would not stay here if you have an issue with it!"
2291390,531847743,9/18/2019,"Great location,  bare bones and underwhelming as far as amenities go. Great, central spot if you are wanting to be out and see the city."
2291390,536684122,9/27/2019,It's located in downtown and there were so good places everywhere.
2291390,541566241,10/5/2019,Really nice stay! Flat was right in the city center but still quiet at night. Hard to find somewhere else to stay for this price. Really worth it if you want to stay close to the tourist spots and temple bar. Checking in and out was pretty easy!

2297145,421369848,3/9/2019,Had a very good stay. My husband and I  brought our 7 month old baby on his first international trip and Conjn kept us in a more private space so we wouldnt disturb the other guests. We had a pleasant stay and would recommend to other travelers.
2297145,421818750,3/10/2019,"Great location, with parking which is certainly a bonus in Dublin.  Clean room, beds and ensuite bathroom with soap, shower gels & towels provided.  Hairdryer provided and a good one not the daft ones you get in hotels that dry nothing.  Very friendly hosts who are most accommodating and helpful.  Breakfast is an added bonus served in a breakfast room, cereals, toast, wheaten bread, ham, cheese & jams with fresh orange juice, tea and coffee - excellent start to the day.   20 - 25 minute walk or a 5 - 10 minute bus into Temple Bar, very handy.  Would definitely use again next time we're in Dublin for a concert or show."
2297145,422491612,3/11/2019,"Perfect location, 15 mins walking from everything ! Great beds, clean, comfortable room in a lovely Irish house. Nice breakfast to start the day ! Would highly recommend!"

2297145,426892437,3/22/2019,"Great location. We enjoyed our stay. However, the walls are very thin so you can hear everything from the surrounding rooms. If youre a deep sleeper, like me, it wont bother you... my girlfriend on the other-hand had a bit tougher time sleeping."
2297145,427250118,3/23/2019,Easy check in & great location for traveling! Bus stop steps from bnb to/from airport. Great rooms & super comfy beds!!!
2297145,427942177,3/24/2019,"Simple, nice, family run bed and breakfast. Location is quite good its about 20 minute walk to the city. The hosts let us leave our bag before checking in which was really helpful. Breakfast is a nice touch. Alma around the corner does an amazing brunch."
2297145,429593950,3/28/2019,"I stayed with Conj when I arrived and left Dublin. (I was driving the countryside for the week.) The room was clean and well stocked with any toiletries I may have needed. I loved that I was walking distance to many local bars, parks, and other attractions! A light breakfast of toast, ham, cheese and cereals was a nice touch also! Highly recommend!"
2297145,430334764,3/30/2019,"Great place in a nice area, close to the city centre and has everything you need! Con was very quick at responding to any queries I had prior to the trip!"
2297145,432291714,4/3/2019,The hosts are a very sweet couple and very helpful.
2297145,432976846,4/5/2019,I wish I could give more than 5 stars for the penthouse. Patrick's daughter Sinead let us know it was ready earlier than we expected and left detailed instructions on how to enter as well as instructions for washer dryer which we needed to use. Everything was spelled out very clearly. It was wonderful! It was impeccably clean and well cared for. There were staples in kitchen as well as fresh eggs milk juice and bread. It was beautiful weather so we could take full advantage of the view from the deck. We wished we could have stayed longer! Thank you so much for sharing your home and extending such a gracious welcome. We would recommend this to anyone. It was only my husband and I but the place is very large and would be great for families also.
2297145,433405377,4/6/2019,Great little b n' b to stay in while passing through Dublin. Short walk to city center and lovely breakfast!!

2297145,435111582,4/9/2019,Nice spot close to downtown with free parking. The bed is not very comfortable though.
2297145,435416181,4/10/2019,"Great location. 15 minute walk to some of the most desirable locations in Dublin. I personally loved the walk because we got to see the city, had access to everything, but were also in a fairly quite location. Very clean and very private. The morning breakfast was cute and filling. Thank you for a great stay!"
2297145,437100375,4/14/2019,"Great stay at Conj's B&B, the apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The only thing I would say is that breakfast is a little limited compared to other B&Bs we have stayed at in the area, but we still left in the morning feeling full. Thank you."
2297145,438646077,4/17/2019,"Reasonable location -about 20 or 25 minute walk to St. Stephan's Green. Very enjoyable continental breakfast. Very small room -bed only, no chairs. Affords good value accomodation reasonably close to tourist areas."
2297145,441622972,4/22/2019,"Super friendly, clean, quiet cozy and central. We enjoyed our stay there.   thank you!"
2297145,442329994,4/23/2019,Handy for the centre and a great Indian restaurant not far away.
2297145,443215078,4/25/2019,"Conj and Catherine are very hospitable hosts! The rooms are sparkling clean, the breakfast was very nice and they gave us some great suggestions in the area.  They live in a great neighborhood. Its a very walkable area! We would stay again if we found ourselves in Dublin.

Thank you for sharing your home with us!

2297145,447910840,5/4/2019,This was about a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar area. It was good for an over night stay. Host and his wife we're friendly!
2297145,449358240,5/6/2019,"Very nice Bed & Breakfast, Conj gave us a warm welcome and some useful tips for our stay in Dublin. The place was very clean and tidy, the room was spacious enough for the two of us and we even had our own bathroom. The breakfast is from 8-9:30 am and both bread and cereals were offered.
The accomodation is close to the city center and several busses stop in 1 min walking distance, including No. 16 which also goes to the airport (cheaper than No. 747).
Overall a very nice place with nice hosts, good connection to public transport and a quiet neightbourhood. I'd definitely stay there again!"
2297145,450069011,5/8/2019,Perfect place to stay in Dublin. Walking distance to nearby pubs and attractions yet in a quiet part of town. Really yummy breakfast too!
2297145,450788319,5/10/2019,This B&B is run by a lovely Irish couple. The accomodation was clean and within walking distace to the city centre. It is also very close to transportation into the city centre. The airport bus drops you off within a 5 minute walk. A continental breakfast is also provided. A number of pubs and stores are close to this B&B. I would recommend this B&B.
2297145,452948996,5/14/2019,This is a good place to stay. Clean and simple decor. Friendly hosts and good location.
2297145,453268094,5/15/2019,"Conjs place was nice but few things i noticed. Noticed that our blanket and sheets had stains on them, after reading the reviews I was expecting a little more. The bed was comfortable. They were very nice. Breakfast was light, so you may want to eat something after but overall decent place to stay."
2297145,455016779,5/19/2019,Very nice place and great breakfast. Would recommend to anyone!
2297145,456297669,5/21/2019,"Our room was nice and cozy, quiet, cable tv, en suite bathroom and a nice breakfast in the morning. Just what we needed for a night passing through the city."
2297145,457071059,5/23/2019,Conj and Kathryn are wonderful hosts and go to great lengths to make you welcome. We arrived late but Conj still met us at the door and helped get us settled after a long flight.  Very close to the town centre and easy to catch public transport in.   Highly recommend.
2297145,458041087,5/25/2019,The location of the BnB is perfect. 15min walk to Grafton Street and St.Stephens Park. Check in was smooth and Con even carried my suitcase up the stairs. Breakfast in the morning was great. The Irish Ham and soda bread was delicious. Thanks again Catherine. Would definitely recommend this place for your stay in Dublin
2297145,459360970,5/27/2019,"Immaculately clean and in an excellent location, within walking distance to all major attractions. Breakfast in the morning was an added bonus."
2297145,460073866,5/28/2019,We had a great stay! Conj and everyone at the B&B were very welcoming and kind! The room was exactly what we expected. Although the bed was a bit uncomfortable. Overall we had a great stay while we were traveling through Dublin!
2297145,463969170,6/4/2019,"Conjs place was great for our one night stop in Dublin. It offered a convenient location (walking distance to all sites we wanted to see), and it was ideal having a private bathroom. Conj was flexible with check-in time and met us on our arrival for a straightforward check-in."
2297145,465710121,6/8/2019,Fantastic Location.
2297145,468778776,6/13/2019,It is an old B &B but the rooms and bath where clean and spacious. The breakfast was continental but fine. The host was very helpful with maps and directions!
2297145,469343900,6/14/2019,"Con J was a very helpful and attentive host and the accommodation was well situated , very clean and comfortable and really good value for money . Con was easy to communicate with and gave us all the information we needed prior to check in."
2297145,469839034,6/15/2019,"Con J was a fantastic host and his place was clean and cosy. Unfortunately, we weren't able to stay long! Con J was extremely responsive and met us at the door when we checked in. The place is only a 10-15 minute walk from the city centre, so a really convenient way to see the city. Thanks for hosting us Con J!"
2297145,471899892,6/18/2019,Very helpful and good location.
2297145,476420820,6/26/2019,"The accommodations were OK, nothing special but adequate.  The location was further from the city center than I expected, my fault no Conj's.  It is a residential neighborhood with not many restaurants in the immediate area.   Breakfast was continental with no hot breakfast offered."
2297145,476862880,6/27/2019,Conjs place is a nice stay. Close to downtown. Conj will even move his car to let you park in his spot. They have a nice little breakfast nook and they do a cold breakfast with ham & cheese with cereal and granola choices. This was our first B&B experience in Dublin! Very friendly folks who are accommodating.
2297145,478057932,6/29/2019,We had a nice stay at Conj's place. Our hostess was very friendly and helpful.  Housekeeping was very good - ironed sheets were a treat! The room is small but very good value for money.
2297145,479616580,7/1/2019,This B&B has quite narrow curving steps up to the second floor rooms.  The breakfastù consisted on some cheeses and 2 slices of ham and one slice of toast.  Not a filling breakfast if you were hoping to set out on a good day of sightseeing.
2297145,482322409,7/6/2019,"Con was a brilliant host, was very helpful and explained how to get about on the luis and buses. The bed was comfy and his house was clean. We will definitely be back again to stay"
2297145,484761974,7/9/2019,"Lovely area, a 10-minute walk from Grafton Street. The room I was given was spacious, freshly renovated and extremely clean. The breakfast in the morning was good and offered by a lovely lady. Definitely will come back"

2297145,500614939,8/2/2019,"This BnB is so sweet and comfy. The room was exactly what we needed, with an en-suite. We were able to get a taxi very easily and tour around the city. Conji and his wife were kind enough to let us keep our stuff there, after check-out, until our flight left. Also, breakfast was superb."
2297145,501344680,8/3/2019,"Room is a little smaller than anticipated, but walking distance to everything in city and clean."
2297145,504452635,8/7/2019,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2297145,504732406,8/8/2019,"Convenient amenities nearby- bank, convenient store, restaurants within walking distance. Clean and comfy room. Others staying in next rooms were courteous and quiet. Be prepared for the tight streets."
2297145,506358268,8/10/2019,Great location. Close enough too the live action in town but just far enough away to get away from the noise of the city at night.
2297145,508815459,8/13/2019,"The bed and breakfast was what I expected based off other reviews. Nothing super fancy. The room was as pictured and everything was clean. Breakfast was the option of cereal, yogurt and toast. The walk into town was a bit further than expected. About a 25-30 minute walk to where we wanted to go. The bars and neighborhood in the surrounding area were fun! Would suggest going to Ryans and Devitts for a good time and traditional local music."
2297145,509221029,8/14/2019,"Easy to find
 parking for our hired car. clean and simple. A short walk to main attractions and easy to get out of town. Kind hospitality and lovely gluten free bread for us"

2297145,518893867,8/27/2019,"The Airbnb is located really close to the city centre, aprox 15min walk. Many Bars and Restaurants are near by, as well as a supermarket.
It is still a very quiet area where you can sleep with your windows wide open.
The breakfast is simple but perfect for a good start in your day.
Your host is lovely and will help you with every need."
2297145,520413068,8/30/2019,We enjoyed staying at Conjs. It was in a great location and was only a short walk away from the city centre. Conj provided us with a handy map as well.
2297145,522630200,9/2/2019,Accessible to the main sights by long walk or tram. Good pubs in the area. Not much sound proof between rooms. Decent breakfast.
2297145,523351202,9/3/2019,Fantastic hospitality! All around great place to stay.
2297145,523672688,9/4/2019,"We loved our stay here as our first stop in Ireland. Check in was easy and we were able to drop our bags early and go exploring before settling in. The room was perfect in every way: clean, comfortable, plenty of small extra touches, and quiet. It was an easy walk to most places and the map that Cathy provided us was very helpful in planning our day. Of course having the WiFi helped us find details about bus routes, museum times, etc. Speaking of buses, the city bus 16 practically drops you at the door, but the 757 Airlink bus is quicker from the airport, although more expensive, and only a short walk to Conjs door.
Breakfast was plentiful and delicious,  and we loved visiting with Cathy during breakfast, a very personal touch.
We look forward to our next stay here."
2297145,525241559,9/7/2019,"Nice b&b near the City, everything like described and expected. Next time in Dublin we will book this B&b again. Recommendation!"

2297145,528466571,9/13/2019,We loved our stay at the Airbnb! Conj was very helpful and helped us with our luggage and tips for Dublin. Thanks for sharing your place!
2297145,530031098,9/15/2019,"Our stay at Conj's place was incredible. The room was well worth the price, as it was very clean, comfortable and convenient. Checking in and parking was very straightforward - we were greeted right away and told exactly where to park. There was coffee, tea and a kettle in the room which was a very nice touch.  The blankets and bed were very cozy. After the first night they came in and cleaned our room and replaced our towels! The location of this place was also ideal for walking to the city centre and even all the way to Phoenix Park.  We would definitely recommend a stay at Conj's place!"
2297145,531859490,9/18/2019,We stayed at this lovely BnB for 2 nights after flying in from Canada. Conj was kind enough to let us check in serveal hours early to let us rest. We were met at the door and a gentleman kindly bought my luggage up and showed us around and offered to answer any questions we had. We were offered a nice breakfast each morning. Over all it was lovely and very close to everything we needed.

2297145,543685890,10/8/2019,"We stayed at Conj's bed and breakfast on three separate visits as a transition in and out of Dublin and each time had a great experience. Conj and Cathy are so welcoming, the room is clean, comfortable, and has everything we need for settling in and easily walking around Dublin to explore the sights. Breakfast is very generous with lots of choices. The neighborhood is quiet and close to bus stops, a variety of restaurants, and a small grocery. We would definitely stay here again. It began to feel like our home away from home."
2297145,546223595,10/13/2019,"We were able to park our car here early and Conj met us outside and made sure we were in the right spot. He also held our bags for us, so we could enjoy the city. The space was everything we expected and perfect for our quick stay."
2297145,549586904,10/18/2019,Small but comfortable room in a very quiet and tidy part of Dublin. All the main tourist attractions are within a 30-minute-walk radius. Rooms are perfectly clean and the staff was very forthcoming! Suggested!

2297145,557571750,11/1/2019,"Location is quite near to city center (15 minutes to walk). Romms are small and kept simple but bed and bathroom are okay. Breakfast is nothing special, cereals, toast, bread, cheese, ham, marmelade and honey, but was fine. 
For people who want to visit city center it is perfect. Parking was free in an area where you have to pay everywhere. And we could keep the car in place until late afternoon without paying. Nice host and absolute recommendation!"
2297145,558002208,11/2/2019,"The host, place and location themselves...WONDERFUL. The location is ideal! Steps from the 16 bus route which travels to and from the airport. Very clean room, tiny, but it had all the necessities. The only thing I would say was a negative was the other AirBnB tenant, they were very loud at very early hours and with the thin walls that doesn't allow for much privacy.  I wish there was a way guest could rate other guest,"
2297145,558708203,11/3/2019,Lovely hosts. Great location.
2297145,561934922,11/10/2019,"The house is in good location, walking distance to most attractions, but at the same time quiet and peaceful. There is a small convenience store 3 minutes away.

2314090,488507861,7/15/2019,"Ger and Jean are both phenomenal and warm people. Their home is lovely and very tidy. They were so kind and charming. From the moment I arrived they felt like distant family, I could have easily adopted them as my Irish parents! They ensured I had lunch by offering a great recommendation. Breakfast was on my time and filled with conversation about plans for the day and what I did the night before. They helped with directions and bus planning. They offered suggestions of places they thought I would be interested in then went through the trouble of looking up proper directions and planning for me.  Before I left, they wanted to ensure I had another place booked for the next leg of my journey and helped me do so. They are truly caring and kind people.  I hope one day I can meet them again!!

If you stay here, you get more than a room; you get a home and temporary family. This place is a must stay!!"

2383085,450807182,5/10/2019,We just checked out of Chris place. Communication was easy with a close meeting place from the bus stop near Christ Church. This location is excellent for sightseeing whether you are walking or catching the hop on hop off bus. Close to plenty of pubs and restaurants.

2383085,474491128,6/23/2019,"We stayed at Chris's apartment for 3 nights in June.  Not having been to Dublin before it was far more convenient and central to all that we wanted to see and do than we realised, you can walk everywhere and everywhere we did in sunshine too with no rain!
The apartment was very clean with plenty of towels and had everything we needed, including tea and coffee and a few other things should we have needed them.
Would thoroughly recommend for a short or longer stay."

2383085,477472503,6/28/2019,"I cant say enough nice things about Chris and this apartment. Absolutely perfect for a couple or two close friends. Chris included all the necessary and bonus touches. Coffee and tea, plenty of towels, all the toiletries you may have forgotten or didnt even know you could have. He included so many things I was inspired to leave a present for the next guests with some chocolates. 

Well located away from the crowded Temple Bar area but close enough to go there whenever we wanted. The street traffic was a bit noisy at times but I cant imagine any street in city center would be without some noise or traffic. 

Chris offered so many wonderful local recommendations and even helped us navigate to our next spot. If you have any questions at all reach out to him in advance and that will make your stay in Dublin even better."
2383085,479769838,7/1/2019,"This location was clean, comfortable, and in a perfect spot in the city. Super convenient and walking distance to everything. Highly recommend!"

We would not hesitate to recommend a stay at Chriss place"
2383085,483010654,7/7/2019,"The apartment was perfectly situated for exploring Dublin City centre. Very close to Grafton street, temple bar and all the attractions Dublin has to offer. The apartment was a little gem and so homely. The tiny balcony was a bonus to take in the sun with a coffee- though its a squeeze for 2 people to sit out on. Plenty of amenities in the apartment, literally all you need is a pint of milk as everything else was available eg tea, coffee etc.
Chris was a lovely welcoming host and we would definitely recommend the apartment."
2383085,484752798,7/9/2019,"Chris apartment is in a great location and is absolutely lovely . We will definitely return if we stay in Dublin again. Communication with Chris was very timely and check in was really great. Chris had also left some great recommendations as there are lots of places to visit, eat and drink nearby.

2383085,498120916,7/29/2019,"AWESOME LOCATION*****5 stars for location alone, unit was super tiny-smaller than expected, needed xtra linens and pillows, need more fans readily available, very stuffy at night. Otherwise great-prompt-courteous communication with host, great suggestions, easy access to unit. Thank you Chris for your hospitality"
2383085,499278855,7/31/2019,"This apartment is great! Super close to lots of things, restaurants, bars, attractions, etc. Chris was out of town for our stay so his nieceù Evelyn let us in. She was a doll! On top of this, his apartment is absolutely filled with information on what to do and see in the area which I found super great! 
Unfortunately my cell service was being very flaky, so I struggled to get messages to Chris, and I feel bad for that, however he was quick to respond when I could get through and very easy to work with. Ive never had an Airbnb host go so far above and beyond to make sure we had recommendations on where to go and how to get around!"
2383085,500510811,8/2/2019,"The owner Chris is very hospitable and helpful in quickly returning email messages and providing a package of useful information prior to our arrival. We actually were not able to meet with him in person as we had to take a later flight from London and Chris was heading out of town before that so he arranged a very personable contact person to meet us when we arrived and show us the apartment. Parking is usually an issue to minimize the time to move between car and apartment but this propert has a small car park right across the street that Chris was able to arrange our rental of a spot in the park. We were on the second floor but there is a lift so bringing up luggage was effortless. The apartment had all what my wife and I needed during our stay; there is a sleeping room with a double bed and a door that can be closed if someone wants to stay up late. The combination kitchen, bar counter, living room is comfortable with all standard amenities. After a long day I was happy to find CNN on cable to wind down. The location to local restaurants and pubs is excellent - as attested to by my wife who went around the corner to hear a local band and get a good dinner while you-know-who was winding down listening to recent developments in the news. 
Overall I'd rate the apartment as excellent for the location and price. The location is just down the street from Christ Church and pick up stations for city buses and a Hop On/Hop off bus route which were very helpful for us. There are also grocery stores nearby within walking distance. The unit itself is compact but had all the space and amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. It has a small balcony with a table and chairs to sit outside.
We would certainly return for a future stay."
2383085,502894603,8/5/2019,Very convenient location. Chris as a host was excellent. Helped us to get our bearings and gave us tips on sightseeing and dining. The apartment and car parking were both very secure.
2383085,505384975,8/9/2019,Cozy apartment with everything you need and right in the doorstep of the best places in Dublin.

I really appreciated her help."
2394893,436498057,4/13/2019,"Like all other reviewers, all I have is highest praise for Maeve and Ken as top-notched hosts.

Without a doubt, my favorite aspect of my stay was the time spent in conversation with Maeve, Ken and the other guests around the breakfast table--a very good breakfast, indeed!"

Maeve and Ken could not do enough for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at their beautiful home that offers all comforts for your stay.  I would highly recommend saying in this home.
2394893,447321362,5/3/2019,"Absolutely wonderful hosts!! Best Irish hospitality ever...because there were 3 groups of Canadians staying here Ken went out of his way to whip up pancakes with maple syrup for our breakfast.  
Easy bus transportation into the city....Maeve was a fount of knowledge for where to go and how to get there. We would absolutely stay with them again."
2394893,448551387,5/5/2019,"Maeve and Ken work hard to make sure their guests have a clean, nice space to spend the night and have as much knowledge as possible about navigating Dublin.

From the moment you walk thru the door you will feel like you are at home !!"
2394893,451957051,5/12/2019,"About 15 minutes away from the airport and 25-35 minutes from the center (depending on traffic), Maeve and Ken's place has a great location in the northern part of Dublin. The bus stops are right there, there are a convenience store, a great pub and a bunch of other stores and restaurants next door. So the location is perfect. But what makes this home great to stay at are the hosts. With a lot of experience behind their back, they know exactly what information to offer visitors. They respond quickly to any questions and make you feel welcome even before you show up. Once you are in their house, you are their house guest (not a customer). We had lovely chats over delicious breakfast (that offered Irish staples) and sometimes in the evening, as I sipped the evening tea they made for me. The room I stayed had everything I needed and more. And there are these personal touches that make you feel happy. When Maeve learned that another of the visiting guests had a birthday that day, she brought out a little gift, kept just for such occasions. They provided a card for the public transportation system that made  fares cheaper. And their business cards included information on the buses one needed to get back and forth to their place. They are simply generous, lovely people who make you feel at home."
2394893,453280621,5/15/2019,Maeve and Ken made us feel right at home. Their warm hospitality was second to none and it was clear that they genuinely care about their guests' experiences both at their home and around Dublin. They have a lovely home which they keep immaculately clean and there are places for guests to unwind. We enjoyed a soak in the hot tub on our first night and relaxed in the guest lounge on our second. Listen to their advice on local transit and attractions and you will have a wonderful time in Dublin.
2394893,455147300,5/19/2019,Absolutely wonderful hosts.  Ken and Maeve were hands down the most hospitable hosts we could have asked for.

Every day we appreciated the big breakfast as well as the jacuzzi in the evening. The house is conveniently located, next to a bus stop where you can go to the airport or city center easily, about 20min each. Dont hesitate book it !"
2394893,499871741,8/1/2019,"We enjoyed staying with Ken and Maeve very much. They were amazing hosts and more than helpful during our arrival (we were in a big rush and everything was a bit chaotic). We felt right at home and enjoyed listening to all their stories, the ones on Irish history in particular. Our room was spacious and clean, and the breakfast was great. So to sum it up: we highly recommend staying with them, especially if you like it quiet and enjoy talking to locals."

2394893,550799066,10/19/2019,"Maeve and Ken are the friendliest, most knowledgable, warmest and simply the most fantastic hosts we could have asked for. The location is very convenient as their home is close to the city center but away from all of the crowds. Breakfast was lovely, the room was very clean and we got some amazing recommendations for places to visit in Dublin. 100% recommend staying with them - it was our first time staying in an airbnb but with hosts like Maeve and Ken we would not even consider staying anywhere else if we ever return to Dublin! Better than we could have wished for."
2394893,552199650,10/21/2019,"Ken and Maeve were great hosts! They greeted us upon arrival, gave us local tips and cooked us a great breakfast! Their house is convenient for the bus but they're also happy to get you a taxi. I would highly recommend staying with Ken and Maeve!"
2394893,553996154,10/25/2019,"Maeve and Ken are such wonderful hosts.  They made us feel like family.  The property is just a 15 minute bus ride from the airport.  We hope to return to Dublin, and when we do, we will definitely be contacting Maeve and Ken.  We will also be recommending this airbnb to others."
2394893,556727088,10/30/2019,"Amazing hosts, friendly, knowledgeable, approachable. I came to visit my friend but made friends along, my best Airbnb experience ever! Would definitely recommend to anyone and stay with them again if I come back to Dublin one day!"
2394893,559575548,11/4/2019,"What a wonderful home and what a wonderful couple. Maeve and Ken were soooo helpful. The home was immaculate, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was simple fare but filling. Location was close to Dublin airport and downtown bus routes. But the sweet spot was this couple. Unforgettable. 
Make your stay in beautiful Dublin extra special here."
2394893,565372181,11/17/2019,This was a great place to stay when visiting Dublin! There is a bus stop right outside the house which made it easy to get into downtown and get back. The house was beautiful and the hosts were generous and made us feel very welcome. The breakfast was also a great touch!
2415104,420924696,3/8/2019,Great place with a great host!
2415104,422515597,3/11/2019,Fantastic apartment.  Camden street has it all - live like a local but right in the heart of Dublin.  Lexs place is decorated very eclectically and it has a fun vibe.  Lex has a lot of local knowledge and started our trip off with a warm welcome.  The street parking is clutch if you are renting a car.
2415104,428493817,3/25/2019,"We were four people arriving at 3 different times and Lex handled it with aplomb.  He was gracious and very accommodating in all requests.  
We all loved his house.  The location was amazing.  Bustling Camden Street with its restaurants/pubs/stores is literally a one minute walk away, yet the house is quiet and comfortable.  There is a cosy back patio area, but sadly we didn't have the time to utilize it.  It really felt like home and everything we needed was there. 
The walk to the touristy areas (St. Patrick's, Brazen Head, Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, Grafton Street) are all less than 20 minutes.  
Really a great place to stay and we couldn't have been happier.  
If it's available, I would just book it."
2415104,429545618,3/28/2019,Beautifully decorated - great kitchen -backyard space and spacious townhouse - one of my favorite airbnb experience
2415104,433893744,4/7/2019,"Lex is a good guy and the location is fantastic.  Unfortunately , the place is darker than the photos indicate and it is quite cluttered.  Our biggest problem was the cleanliness of the apartment.  

Rick & Diane"
2415104,438271602,4/16/2019,"Lexs funky, quirky place was awesome. Very cosy and inviting, and so close to everything. The street itself is quiet and low traffic, but One street over there are several restaurants and stores, and within a 15-20 min easy walking distance from downtown Dublin, Grafton Street, and Temple Bar. Lex also gave us several good  recommendations including restaurants, bars, and things to do and see. Highly recommend this place.  This was our first AirBnB experience and it couldnt have been better."
2415104,440687461,4/21/2019,"We stayed with four people at Lexs funky house - couldnt recommend it too much. It has a very special, cool interieur (everything in the look of the 70ies) and its super located in a calm environment - at the same time you are only a stones throw away from pubs, restaurants and shops (we recommend ûThe Cake Cafe right on the back of Lexs house for breakfast and teatime). Lex was a helpful host and always available for us. Definitively five stars from us."
2415104,442819263,4/24/2019,Super fun and stylish home in a great neighborhood! Lex is a great host!
2415104,444727966,4/28/2019,Lexs place is great and in a great part of the city!
2415104,446771157,5/2/2019,"Perfect house and perfect owner! In a vibrant part of Dublin, full of cafes, pubs, restaurants and clubs, Lex s house is  stylish and warm. It is a big old charming Dublin house in two floors and plenty of space and light. The two bedrooms are on a private garden within a serie of other closed gardens. So your sleep wont be disturbed by any noise.
Dont forget to ask Alex tips on the city life as he knows everything about Dublin. All the coolest places but also museums and fine restaurants. He is welcoming and caring. Simply the perfect host!"
2415104,452957587,5/14/2019,Great location. Great host. Really great Dublin experience
2415104,458057972,5/25/2019,"Our stay was fantastic, the best Airbnb of our multi-city trip. The location is great, on a quiet street, but literally one block from tons of great restaurants, bars, shopping - and totally walkable to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, and other popular sights. Lex gave us great restaurant recommendations and we were impressed by every one of them that we tried. The house has tons of charm and really feels like a home."
2415104,460530348,5/29/2019,"Lex's home was a great base for our trip in Dublin. Easy walk or quick taxi ride to all the places we wanted to go. Quirky, retro decor made it a fun and unique place to stay. Great restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood as well. Lex was very accommodating with an early check in for us and left a delicious fresh baguette."
2415104,466607187,6/9/2019,This home is PERFECT for a trip to Dublin.  It's centrally located but your street will feel quiet and homey.  The house itself is incredibly comfortable and a great place to spend a few nights while exploring Dublin!
2415104,469274643,6/14/2019,Everything was OK and as stated in the description and pictures.
2415104,471245091,6/17/2019,"Lexs place was exactly what we were looking for in location walking to St Stephens green to start out to Trinity College and sights. Wonderfully quiet with soft beds and beautiful outdoor sitting area. Do not miss Camden Kitchen seems pricey but we paid the same for a pub dinner at catch 22. Amazing duck and chicken. Highlights were street musicians on Grafton st, pigeon guy in park, book of Kells and long room with our hilarious tour guide a local. Great neighborhood. Thanks for the hospitality Lex"
2415104,480780985,7/3/2019,Host is very friendly and well informed about the general neighborhood and offers lots of local tips.  Great location to the heart of Dublin.
2415104,492189198,7/21/2019,"we travelled in a group of friends and really liked the place. It has a lot of interior details, stylish and enough space for 6 ppl. the location is quit but a lot of bars and restaurants are just arround the corner like 3min walk.

thanks for the lcal tipps, too"
2415104,516339954,8/24/2019,"We loved staying in Lexs home!  Hes in a great locationî a shockingly quiet street just a block away from great coffeehouses and restaurants. Youve got easy access to the light rail and the bus lines. We were comfortable in all four beds (one of them a sofa bed), and the wooden window shades kept the light out in all bedrooms effectively. The shower has an electric adapter that ensures you never run out of hot water, and there is also a washer, a dryer, and a dishwasher. Lex himself is a kind and friendly host. If Id known he was a DJ, I would have brought him a record from my hometown. Thanks, Lex!"
2415104,518240650,8/26/2019,Cool DJ and cool place.
2415104,535470932,9/24/2019,"Walking into this house was like walking into a 70's/80's dream come true. A little vintage radio playing French music; Fresh gourmet cheese and bread laid out for us in the kitchen; Nostalgic colors and posters enforcing a stylish and relaxed vibe. Open windows to the back gardens let the rooms breathe. All the bits and bobs around the place seemed to be carefully chosen and placed with technique. Every little thing in the house was a cool vintage version of what it would be at any other spot. This place really was a dream house and we ended up spending more time inside it than outside. 

Lex was a fantastic host as well. He sent us several amazing recommendations about the surrounding area, which ended up being the cooler part of Dublin (we'd stayed in Temple bar a few days before). His recommended restaurants were some of the best food we'd eaten on our trip, and checked in the morning to see if we needed anything. 

Overall, this was certainly the coolest Airbnb we'd ever stayed in and was a major highlight of our entire vacation. This place will be the first thing that comes to mind if we ever come back to Dublin."
2415104,537308771,9/28/2019,Loved our stay here.
2415104,538893093,9/30/2019,"Lexs place is an incredibly hip, warm, and inviting home in the heart of everything Dublin has to offer.
We were able to walk to all the best restaurants and sights in 15 minutes or less, and it was great to return to a place that genuinely felt like home at the end of each day.
Lexs hospitality was also top notch, and for anyone looking at a weekend away in Dublin, this one should absolutely be your winner!"
2415104,544950453,10/11/2019,Very friendly and patiently when teaching us how to use the key correctly and helped me to find the crushed car. All rooms are very good and quiet.there is good quality food. very convenience place .Thank you very much!

2415104,555203596,10/27/2019,"We were three persons staying from friday to sunday. Lex was a perfect host, he answered very quick and gave us a lot of useful information about the neighbourhood. The place was very nice and quiet with a little patio and very close to restaurants, pubs and shops. We will definetly stay there on our next trip to Dublin!"
2415104,558755564,11/3/2019,"Lex was helpful and approachable
The house is small but stylish 
A lovey area"
2427857,419565690,3/4/2019,"What can we say? This was the best start to a 10 day Ireland Trip. From the very beginning when Ken came out to help us park to the extremely helpful tips on what to do and where to go. We arrived after a long flight, slept 10 hrs the first night without even realizing how long we had slept, took the train down to the city both days (less than 15 min), and had a fantastic breakfast with them one morning. We couldn't have asked for a better introduction and start to our journey. We highly recommend and would absolutely stay with them again."
2427857,422483097,3/11/2019,"Maeve & Kens place is a wonderful location - close enough to Dublin for easy access but far enough that its peaceful and quiet. Their helpfulness for things to see and do really add an extra level to your trip, and you couldnt find kinder or more thoughtful hosts!"
2427857,427795545,3/24/2019,"We have traveled a lot, but Maeve and Ken are by far the best hosts we have ever had.  On arrival, Maeve met us for check-in, gave us a tour, made us a cup of coffee, took out a map, and began to label all the best places in town with thorough reasons why we should see them.  The room was clean with a large bathroom and she and Ken were the most hospitable people I have ever met.  We spent hours our last night just talking with them!  You can tell they love having people in their home.  She makes an excellent family style breakfast, and offers you cookies and coffee every time she sees you.  They love Dublin and are very knowledgeable about the place.  We would stay with ONLY them if we are ever in the Dublin area again!"
2427857,431035403,3/31/2019,Extremely nice and very very caring. Also very helpful in finding way around the city.
2427857,440068973,4/20/2019,"Our stay with Maeve and Ken was really enjoyable. They gave us lots of information on places to visit, most of which we probably wouldn't have seen without their recommendations! They are very friendly but also respectful of the guests' space."
2427857,442797770,4/24/2019,We had a fantastic time during our stay at Maeves & Ken's home. Both were very helpful and friendly. The room and the entire home is just amazing. Really liked the garden and the great breakfast. Thanks a lot!!

2427857,445444526,4/29/2019,"Maeve and Ken are fabulous, interesting hosts who welcomed us into their lovely home with all creature comforts. They provided amazing tips and help from the moment we landed in Dublin and a 15 minute bus trip later, we were greeted with coffee and a warm welcome. All facilities were top class and we loved a soak in the jacuzzi after a day of exploring the sights. The breakfasts and sitting at their table mingling with other guests was a highlight."
2427857,447329443,5/3/2019,"From our arrival until our departure on day 3, we were afforded the highest level of welcome, comfort and practical local tips to move easily about the city. Our accomodations were very clean and efficient and the breakfasts so hearty and delicious. Extra perks like Leap cards to add value to for local buses and information papers with essential lodging pointers and city suggestions made our days more relaxed and enjoyable. Ideal hosts and home!"
2427857,450084776,5/8/2019,Maeve & Ken bring hospitality to a new high. They were welcoming  & always ready to assist with any need. Their home is close to bus stop for quick  ride into Dublin or minutes to airport. Thanks for a lovely stay.

2427857,455132859,5/19/2019,"Maeve and Kens house was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in and when we go back to Dublin we will definitely be staying with them again! Everything was great from the check in process, amenities included, local tips and hospitality. When we got there, they were there to greet us, give us our keys, provide local tips and show us a map of the center city of Dublin as well as places to visit and where things are. They had a list of different restaurants to try and provided Leap cards for using the bus (which was the easiest and most affordable way to get around the city). Maeve and Ken are the nicest people ever and they really care about the people staying in their home. They also provided breakfast which was so nice because we got to take time in the morning to chat with them and the other guests. 100% recommend staying with Maeve and Ken if youre visiting Dublin. They are the absolute best and my husband and I cant say the best things of them and thank them enough for a great stay!!"
2427857,461264764,5/31/2019,"Not only is the Air BNB lovely, Ken & Maeve are the most delightful people to be around. They made us feel comfortable right away, like we were part of the family. They always checked in on us at the end of the day to make sure we were getting on okay. They were extremely helpful in navigating the area and offered many recommendations. You can tell they enjoy hosting as they put so much thought and care into it. The room and the house were very clean and comfortable. All in all it was a great stay. Nothing but good things to say."

2427857,475534208,6/24/2019,"Our stay at Maeve and Ken¬¥s house was really a pleasure. As it is not directly in the centre of Dublin, it is really quiet. The connection to the city centre by bus is excellent. The bus stop is right on the other side of the street. Maeve and Ken are fantastic hosts. We got a full overview about what to do in Dublin with a lot of helpful information. The breakfast in great! Although we need to leave really early for our flight, everything was prepared for our breakfast! Maeve and Ken really take care! Thank you so much!"
2427857,479655719,7/1/2019,"Our stay at Maeve and Kens house was absolutely wonderful! Within walking distance from Dublin City University (where our work conference was). The bus stop to the city is just across the street and the pub (the Comet) is almost next door. We had dinner there a couple of times. Maeve and Kens hospitality is amazing, they gave many local tips to visit and they invited us for a BBQ in their lovely (tropical) garden. Maeve and Ken are very nice, interesting people and interested in their guests. We had good talks. I absolutely recommend staying at their place!!"

Room was spacious and clean, bed was very comfy and great to have use of a sitting room in the evening. A great experience x"

They are both incredibly warm and welcoming people, and right away they offered many great suggestions for exploring Dublin. The pub we went to for dinner at their suggestion was absolutely perfect. In the morning, we had a chance to chat with both Maeve and Ken, as well as some other guests, over a lovely breakfast. Their home is also directly across the street from a bus stop where you can catch the bus to the city center, which we found very convenient. They were also kind enough to lend us their bus cards, so all we had to do was put money on them. I would love to have the chance to come stay with them again in the future!"

What to say about their breakfast? I'm already missing it!!!! FANTASTIC! Would definitely stay again in Maeve & Ken's home"
2427857,546945402,10/14/2019,"Ken and Maeve are excellent hosts. Every morning a lovely breakfast with a nice chat. The busstop is just across the street. 
We got great tips for out stay in Dublin."
2427857,547886051,10/16/2019,"Ken and Maeve are kind and lovely hosts. Being seasoned travelers themselves, they anticipated a lot of our questions and needs. Their home is well situated to get into Dublin and to the airport. Plenty of places to eat and shop within walking distance too. The accommodations (bedroom, bathroom, sitting room) were great as well."
2427857,550803914,10/19/2019,"Great place to stay, exactly as advertised. Clean and everything has been thought through."
2427857,556354039,10/29/2019,"Maeve and Kens place was one of the highlights of our trip. They were warm and welcoming, making us feel at home and providing us with so many great tips! We even received Leap cards for the public transport - the bus was a 20 metre walk across the road and takes you directly to the centre! Thank you Maeve and Ken, our stay was lovely!"
2427857,558761768,11/3/2019,"Maeve and Ken were nothing short of amazing hosts. They welcomed us into their home like family and made sure that we had everything we needed. Additionally, they gave us very clear resources and directions. Maeve even went out of her way ans wrote out specific directions for a day trip to Malahide Castle and Howth. My only regret is that we didn'tstay with them the whole trip (we stayed in a hostel previous to them)! I would recommend them highly to anyone travelling near the Dublin area."
2427857,565222229,11/17/2019,"Maeve and Ken were delightful, contentious hosts.  They were always happy to provide hot water, tea, or coffee and were happy to help with everything from transportation to recommending insider places to explore in Dublin.  The room was clean, and they thoughtfully provided extra towels and bathrobes.  If you like African art, they have a large collection of both traditional and modern Ethiopian work on display which I enjoyed admiring.  I'd definitely stay with them again."
2466169,439172389,4/18/2019,"Claudios place is in a great location, super easy to get to from airport. The place has everything you need on a daily basis, clean, and comfortable. From check in to check out I had no issues, and will come back here, I had a blast in Ireland. Thanks Claudio!"
2466169,440043361,4/20/2019,Claudios place was at a very convenient location - everything was 20 min walkable distance. It had everything we needed and it was clean! Thank you for opening your space for us!
2466169,444001526,4/27/2019,"Our stay was great. The apartment was small, but find for what we needed. We only stayed  there to sleep, so perfect for vacationers. The bathroom was a bit small and was tricky not to get water everywhere!"
2466169,449280004,5/6/2019,Great location and exactly what we needed for a long weekend in Dublin
2466169,451810150,5/12/2019,"Claudio was very flexible, we could check in early, apartment itself is fine, nothing special"
2466169,457144422,5/23/2019,Great locations ideal for city stay :)
2466169,458021710,5/25/2019,"Very convenient location to Guinness Storehouse, Jameson Bow St Experience (Smithfield), with several other pubs and restaurants within a 15-20 minute walk. We parked our rental car in Q-Park Four Courts which was very close and worked out well. The private gated entrance into the apartment complex ensured that we felt safe during our stay. The amenities were just a bit underwhelming because of the size of the shower/bathroom, and the soap and shampoos seemed to be leftovers. Aside from that, I would recommend for those traveling to Dublin on a budget!"
2466169,460526047,5/29/2019,"What a lovely place to stay as either a solo traveler or couple. The space is stylish and very clean. The host is incredibly reliable, quick to respond, gracious, and accommodating. Im thankful to have stumbled upon this place and would happily recommend it to anyone else!"
2466169,461391101,5/31/2019,Claudios place is not fancy but definitely as advertised. He was very responsive and flexible. We appreciated his help. Great location!  We walked everywhere.
2466169,484689766,7/9/2019,I have stayed in Claudios place for one week. It was a very pleasant time and helped me to get trough the first phase of my longer stay in Dublin. I highly recommend this apartment.
2466169,499388901,7/31/2019,"I was pleasantly surprised because the studio space was bigger than it appeared in the pictures and there was more storage space to unpack and hang clothes. I think it is perfect for two people and it didn't feel cramped. Theres 4 or 5 flights of stairs though and the door key hole could use some maintenance/updating. I'd say it's a great value and I felt like the space had everything I needed.

I especially appreciated the fast responses from our host and he was always available when we needed anything. Very kind and thoughtful. We had a stressful arrival because it was so late at night and dark. It was difficult to find the place but we called our host and he helped us. I appreciated the flexibility for checking in and there was a lock box for us with an extra set of keys upon request. We were sooooo happy to have complimentary milk and cookies ready for us when we arrived! Other amenities like soap and olive oil and seasonings helped us save a lot of money as we like to cook at home.

The location is convenient because the airport bus is a 2 minute walk away. There is a bus that takes you to temple bar area in 5 minutes but it doesn't run after midnight so it's a bit of walk coming home (15 minutes?) or an 8euro taxi. But we felt safe in the neighborhood and I felt safe walking alone at night I didn't have any problems. The walk along the river liffy is beautiful. 
Also note don't spend too much time at temple bar try to check out other party areas like Camden street for less touristy experience and more reasonable prices. Temple bar is the most expensive. I liked The George bar on monday there was a fun free drag show and dancing after. 'No name bar' and 'workmans' were also great finds for the nightlife."
2466169,508654462,8/13/2019,"Great base of operations. Claudio had excellent suggestions for what to do while in Dublin. Perfect studio stay for the two of us, the apartment had everything we needed."
2466169,513896470,8/20/2019,"Tidy little studio between Heuston and Temple Bar. Very comfortable bed, great communication from Claudio, and a well-stocked kitchen."
2466169,535756391,9/25/2019,We had a great time walking around. The apartment is near a lot of tourist sites.
2466169,540430421,10/3/2019,"Really enjoyed our stay at Claudio's place. It's location was perfect -- walking distance from Temple Bar, Trinity College, and the airport bus. The kitchen was well equipped which was very helpful. Communication was good too!"

2470847,428480538,3/25/2019,"I really enjoyed the time spend here : the apartament was big, clean and in a good location. Good beds, nice kitchen (we didn't use it too much but it looks like you have everything you might need)."

2470847,450839144,5/10/2019,"This is a great apartment for 2 days or longer; it is a home and allows you to do things with your family like sit around the living room and chat, or make coffee without having to go out."
2470847,457128306,5/23/2019,"Very well designed apartment with plenty of space for 4 adults or a family. So nice to have two full, spacious bathrooms! There's a small grocery store half a block away and a nicer one just a little further, along with several restaurants. We had everything we needed for a relaxing, enjoyable holiday in Dublin."
2470847,463877239,6/4/2019,Nice apartment with all amenities. Location is good with many nice pubs and restaurants close by or easy access to taxis to go further. Temple Bar about a 30 minute walk. Great value and responsive host.
2470847,465695946,6/8/2019,The location is wonderful.  The condo lacks nothing.  Host leaves detailed information.
2470847,470430770,6/16/2019,"This was my first experience of an Airbnb stay, I didn't know what to expect. From the moment my friends and I arrived we were blown away. Spacious accommodation for 6 people in a stylish and very comfortable apartment. Location was superb, central to everywhere and a few great places to eat & drink just around the corner. We had a great stay would highly recommend a stay here."
2470847,501217308,8/3/2019,Cathals place is beautiful and was the perfect size for a family of 4 (2 teenage boys who like separate beds!). A quick and easy walk into the city and many great restaurants! It was perfect.

Excellent recommendations and tips for where to eat in town as well! I hope to stay any time I can visit Dublin again! :)"
2471794,512504755,8/18/2019,"Dorothys home is lovely and she adds such thoughtful touches - like leaving a pitcher of drinking water in our room. A wonderful hostess - we will definitely book again sometime. Thank you, Dorothy!"
2471794,514604059,8/21/2019,"Number 18 Crosthwaite Park is a lovely Victorian house, beautifully restored into a comfortable and charming home.  Guests are encouraged to use all the main rooms, which are full of interesting paintings and art works.  It is situated in a quiet, leafy square but very close to all the attractions of DunLaoghaire, Dalkey and Blackrock, with good parking.  Dorothy, the delightful owner, is most hospitable, and nothing is too much trouble;  she keeps everything spic and span.  We would heartily recommend No. 18, and hope to see Dorothy again some day."
2471794,518221847,8/26/2019,Fabulous host and house! Dorothy was so friendly and welcoming. She was so kind in allowing my daughter to come for breakfast eveey morning too.  We will be back again!

2471794,529221662,9/14/2019,"Dorothys stunning home is in a fabulous location just outside Dublin and really close to the Dart as well as some good local restaurants.  We found our beds super comfortable and the room cosy and quiet.  Breakfast was delicious with many tasty and well thought out healthy options and Dorothy is a wonderful and very helpful host.  In particular allowing a very early check-in on our arrival day was a real blessing after our very long plane journey.  We would definitely recommend a stay here, and would stay again ourselves, but would like to see the bathroom updated a little; being an older house the water pressure in the shower is quite low and I dont think much can be done about that, but its good to be aware before you visit.  It would be good to see more towel rails, some better lighting and a sturdy shelf or two in there, along with some more hooks or place for clothing.  Just little things but it would make the stay even more memorable."
2471794,529911769,9/15/2019,"Dorothy was a lovely host! She lives in a wonderful house and is offering a georgious room with private bathroom! Dun Laoghaire ist a nice place to spend time and we definitely recommend to stay at Dorothys place!  She was a lovely person with lots of helpful and special advice! In case of another trip to Dublin, well immediately choose Dorothys home!"
2486135,418155615,3/1/2019,"The apartment was perfect for us.

If you are like my wife and I, we like to pace ourselves and like to spend time to ourselves. This apartment allows you to do that, but also run to some popular pubs/restaurants without having to venture far. The bedroom was very quiet at night, and we heard no street noise. We will stay here again if we need an apartment around temple bar!"

Jason is a great host and his apartment is great!"

2488781,440158851,4/20/2019,"Jason's place is in a fabulous spot in Dublin.  Great restaurant and entertainment choices are just beneath your feet and all around his place.  Jason does a great job of providing insight into the local scene and he's also an excellent communicator.  

We also found other Dublin attractions easily attainable via walking from Jason's place.  Depending on your conditioning, he's also conveniently located for short cab-rides to just about anything in and around Dublin.

Jason's common areas are nice and bright.  

I have recommended to Jason that he upgrade his pillows."
2488781,441666202,4/22/2019,"Definitely Super Host material! Quick responses, clean and stylish apartment, and most importantly, location!

Apartment was clean and spacious, a good place to recharge. Be mindful that since you are in the heart of the temple area, youll get a lot of noise through the night from people walking from bar to bar.

2488781,451711585,5/12/2019,"This place was perfectly located if you want to get out and see some of the trendy restaurants and pubs that Dublin has to offer! 

We walked to both Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson Distillery from this location without any issue or worries. 

Jason was very helpful and accommodating with our requests and providing tips and suggestions. 

I had read that the area was noisy however, we were there over a weekend and didnt find it to be noisy at all. 

Perfect place for a couple night stay in Dublin!"
2488781,454476962,5/18/2019,"If youre looking for the perfect apt in the center of all the action then this is the place for you. Cute, modern apt in the heart of Temple Bar. Restaurants and bars are literally steps away. The bedroom is spacious and the bed was really comfortable. It didnt get too bright in the morning either. Favorite thing was walking into the living room every morning and opening the doors to the terrace and watching people walk by while listening to the beautiful sounds of Temple Bar. In the morning you heard breakfast being served, in the evening it was more of a party atmosphere. You can definitely hear people on the street while youre sitting on the couch...but come on...youre in Temple Bar and you stay here for the atmosphere. Highly recommend this apt and Jason was great with communication."
2488781,456717329,5/22/2019,"Would stay at this Airbnb again in a heartbeat!! Not only is Jason a great host, but the place is clean, stylish and the location was PERFECT. Highly recommend!!"

2488781,459431673,5/27/2019,"This is an outstanding location for exploring the Dublin sights! This place is literally right around the corner from TheTemple Bar. The neighborhood is loud, but the noise surprisingly isn't an issue for sleeping in the bedroom. I highly recommmend this location especially if you want to enjoy a night or two enjoying Temple Bar. I walked everywhere including to Guinness and the gaol. Jason had great recommendations. My favorites were Rustic Stone and Queen of Tarts (their scones are amazing.. and addictive!)! Thanks Jason!"
2488781,460444072,5/29/2019,Jasons place is incredible! Its centrally located to great bars and restaurants. Very walkable. Jasons notes and recommendations are thorough and extremely helpful. Communication was superb.

Jason is a great host responding quickly to messages and providing a very comprehensive list of places to eat, drink and visit during your stay.

I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay on your next visit to Dublin"

2488781,471872453,6/18/2019,"Jason's place was in a great location, as described, and Jason was easily reachable with fast response times. Would definitely recommend. 

A TIP THO: bring ear plugs. Not that it can be helped but there were some vicious gulls outside, screeching all night. Something must have been up, hopefully that's not the norm."
2488781,474557287,6/23/2019,"Great apartment! Centrally locates ion one of the quieter blocks of Temple Bar, within walking distance of many of Dublins sights. Jason communicated regularly and clearly, and he offered many helpful tips about things to do and see. The space was clean and comfortable, and it really contributed to my overall excellent experience during my Ireland visit."
2488781,476063255,6/25/2019,"Jason's apartment is spacious, stylish, comfortable, and ideally located. And, as others have reported, the bedroom is incredibly quiet for being in such a lively part of town since it's in the very back of the apartment and you can close both the bedroom and living room doors for extra sound installation. Also, Jason was a great communicator... very quick response with lots of local tips and answers to our questions. Highly recommended!"
2488781,476536394,6/26/2019,"If you want to stay in Temple Bar and participate in the somewhat crazy nightlife, this is the place for you.

2489550,453663923,5/16/2019,"Michael's place was literally in the best location! It was right in the center of everything. We didn't need to use public transportation at all. (Although we do like to walk) The kitchen and bathroom were both fully stocked. Lots of extra toilet paper/paper towels/napkins/bath towels. The bed could be a little more comfortable and bigger (double bed), but we were so exhausted at the end of the day it didn't really matter.

His place is clean, the bed is comfortable and the communication was precise and fast. 

It takes about 20 minutes to get there by bus from Temple Bar with a bus pricing of about 3‚Ç¨. Therefore you can reach it quite easily and be able to get anywhere quite fast. 

Just in general a good place to stay. Recommend it!"
2574203,458682354,5/26/2019,"Very beautiful and lovely apartment. Conor was very helpful. The room is comfortable, beautiful and cosy. I really recommend the room!"

I can't recommend staying here enough!"
2574203,475455245,6/24/2019,"Conor is an excellent host. He is very kind, funny, understanding and responds to messages very quickly. The latter is great since I had to coordinate with him my check in time as I was arriving from Edinburgh. The room is tiny, but has some great eccentric touches. There is some sort of a shelf/clothes rack where you can store your bags. The only reason I am giving Conors place 4 stars is due to the spiral stairs. Whilst I was aware of that before booking, I wasnt expecting it to be this brutal. I am speaking for myself (a heavy and chubby boy), it was quite a hassle to go up and down especially with my bags. I really felt like I was gonna break the stairs at one point and thank god I didnt. This is something to keep in mind if you are a bit heavier like me, are carrying loads of bags or claustrophobic. The location is great if you want to go into the city. There is not much in the area, since its mostly residental. However, there are buses that take you through important areas of the city centre or you can take a bus to Heuston station (theres places to get food in there) and get on the Luas (tram). Overall, I recommend this place if you are staying in Dublin!"
2574203,477433622,6/28/2019,Staying at Conors was a wonderful experience. The location was fab! Right around the corner from a bus stop and access to the beautiful Liffey river trail.

2574203,483165576,7/7/2019,"Conors place was amazing! Its a very cute and stylish apartment with everything you could need! The bathroom was especially nice and modern. The room was cute and the bed was comfortable. Its very close to the bus station that will take you into the city in about 15 minutes so super easy to get around! Conor was very nice and allowed me to leave my luggage after check out time so that I didnt have to carry it around until my night flight. Everything was great, highly recommended!"

2574203,508105755,8/12/2019,"It's a really good choice to be Conor's guest, because you will meet a very friendly, open and supporting man and stay at a place with a charming atmosphere in an area of Dublin, from where it is easy to get into the center and where you can relax from the noise and haste there. Lucky you!"
2574203,510040957,8/15/2019,Conor is an excellent host. I really enjoyed my time staying in his home. The listing is exactly as described. Very convenient bus ride into anywhere you could want to go. I would stay again!

2574203,527980577,9/12/2019,Loved this home and my stay here. I walked about 20 mins (I'm slow) to Tesco grocery up the road where I purchased fruit and snacks for the week. I love food! The bus stop was literally right by his complex. Try and know the bus system better than I when trying to get back. Conor's home is super cute with a great shower and toilet and the bed provided great comfort. I slept soundly. Conor himself was a great host and was clear on check in instructions (don't forget to read them) and was helpful with suggestions on Dublin and things to do. I definitely recommend staying at Conor's.
2574203,528583130,9/13/2019,"Conor was a lovely host! His cute townhouse is located around a 20min bus ride from the town center. The room is located on the second floor of the house at the top of a spiral staircase. It is very thoughtfully decorated and very quiet. Lovely stay, thank you Conor!"

My schedule was so opposite of Connor, that I kinda felt I had the place to myself. Its about a 5 minute walk to the bus stop, which takes you directly to the city center. I would definitely stay here again."

2574203,566736932,11/20/2019,"A very nice stay, thank you."
2642164,425415046,3/18/2019,"What a lovely stay! Ted and Gina provided us a warm welcome, they are really great and so lovely people. We instantly felt like home. The room was nice and clean, breakfast incl self-made scones delicious. Howth is a nice and quiet place to stay, you can walk to Howth harbor and railway station in 10min, train to Dublin city is about 30min for 3,50‚Ç¨. Great stay, 100% recommendation! :-)"
2642164,460019656,5/28/2019,"Irish hospitality at its finest!  And yes, Ted's scones are everything they're cracked up to be."
2642164,478128760,6/29/2019,"Ted and Gina are such kind, welcoming, lovely people and it was a pleasure to stay in their home. Their home is on a very quiet street, so I slept exceedingly well, and a highlight was drinking morning coffee in Gina's fabulous garden. Everything is comfortable and sparkling clean. The location could not be better for exploring Howth, and Ted and Gina went well beyond the call of duty in welcoming me & giving me a lift to the train when I was leaving. Gina even made me a Lemsip on the first night when I'd arrived with a rotten cold!"
2642164,482269515,7/6/2019,The room and facilities are spotless. Ted is very accommodating and nothing is too much trouble and should you wish to have your breakfast in the garden during the summer then you may do so.  A lovely place to stay.  I shall return when I can.
2642164,550801427,10/19/2019,Ted and Gina are amazing!  You will love them!  Teds scones and soda bread are fantastic!!!!!!  Howth is beautiful and the pubs are wonderful.
2675211,419980399,3/5/2019,"This is a wonderful place to stay as its not only centrally located, but its also a very charming and enjoyable apartment to stay in. I very much enjoyed my stay here!"
2675211,420971267,3/8/2019,"Absolutely loved this place! Rayne was a terrific host, and there were so many thoughtful touches. The kitchen was great for cooking, and we made a meal on our last night. It was wonderful to have a washer a dryer as well! The apartment was so well decorated, the bed was so comfortable, and the location literally could not have been better. The building was secure and felt very safe. Overall, I could not have been more happy with this Airbnb. 

The only downside (and this has absolutely nothing to do with Rayne or the apartment), is that on the last night of my stay, I went to bed with my new Claddagh ring on, and when I woke up it was no longer on my finger. I really think it was misplaced somewhere in the apartment, but I had to check out the next morning and did not have any luck finding it in the short amount of time I had to search for it. 

If anyone chooses to stay at this apartment (which I HIGHLY recommend you do), please reach out to me via Airbnb if you find it. I would be happy to pay to have it mailed to me and would be so so appreciative. 

Other than that, I loved my time in Dublin and in this apartment. Thank you, Rayne, for being such a great host!!!"
2675211,422580008,3/11/2019,"The apartment is great, cosy, comfy bed, nice decor, well located, had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend! Very happy with our choice."
2675211,423179686,3/13/2019,"Really pretty and comfortable place! Terrific location, it was so easy to walk anywhere we wanted, I also want to add that we didnt really notice the street noise and we stayed here right before St. Pattys day so although its central it isnt noisy! Thanks again Rayne."
2675211,425921650,3/19/2019,Rayne's home was amazing! The location honestly cannot be beaten. Rayne is fast to get back to you and she'd decorated her place beautifully. Would definitely stay again!
2675211,426558993,3/21/2019,Great location. Central to everything & only a short walk to major sites
2675211,427884904,3/24/2019,Les deux principaux points forts : Emplacement exceptionnel et appartement ultra confortable
2675211,428901512,3/26/2019,"The location of this place couldnt be beat - right over HaPenny bridge. A bit of an unusual check in process, but nothing unreasonable. 
There were two reasons we deducted stars: first is that it was very noisy; you could hear everything from the street. We looked and it appeared the bedroom window didnt shut all the way, so it made for some difficult sleeping at times. 
Second is that we were notified during our stay that we needed to leave a key for a handyman to come and fix a vent (nothing that we had noticed a problem with). I was rather uncomfortable with the idea of someone entering the property while we werent there with all of our things there, but was not given an option. We were only there two nights and I felt that any work should have been scheduled when guests were not anticipated. 
We did not spend much time in the apartment so cannot attest to many of the amenities, but worked well enough for our purposes."
2675211,429538238,3/28/2019,"Great location, easy check in process, and Rayne was so easy to communicate with!"
2675211,431030115,3/31/2019,"Really recommend this place! Location was perfect, right across from all the action at night. Slept well in the comfy bed and didnt mind the noise of the partying people. The apartment is spacious and offers a lot of comfort and overall just feels like home. Get yourself in a plane to Dublin already :)"
2675211,432220380,4/3/2019,Beautiful cozy place in the middle of everything! We loved staying there and enjoyed every bit of the trip! Contact was great and super quick response to the questions we had. Lovely guide for things to do and places to eat - would come back anytime!
2675211,432934011,4/5/2019,"We had a lovely stay, location is perfect, the apartment was really nice and clean, Raynes little book of tips was really helpful also!"
2675211,434112002,4/7/2019,"Rayne's place was absolutely perfect for our stay. Just across the bridge from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar, it allowed us to easily head in to the nightlife to enjoy dinner, a drink, and some music, and just as easily allowed us to return home to get some good sleep away from too much noise (good, fun noise... but noise nonetheless!) Rayne provided great suggestions for food, music and shopping in the area that was super helpful. We spent only 2 nights at her lovely apartment, but it felt like home the moment we stepped through the front door. Needless to say, we hope to return back to Dublin one day and will be looking for Rayne's place for availability when we do :)"
2675211,436175791,4/12/2019,Raynes place was exactly as advertised. A wonderful space. Check in was easy and clear. No complaints!
2675211,438339778,4/16/2019,"I absolutely loved staying at Raynes place. The location is perfect, the space available was just right, and she even accommodates her guests with international power converters! It does get noisy from the nightlife at night, but that didnt bother me and honestly it was something I found  endearing about the place. I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity comes for me to visit Dublin in the future!"
2675211,439192056,4/18/2019,"Excellent location, very clean and tidy."
2675211,440740182,4/21/2019,A great little place. Amazing location!
2675211,442410016,4/23/2019,"Our stay was wonderful! The apartment was well appointed, and the bed was very comfortable.  It was in a perfect location close to a lot of restaurants and pubs.  There is some street noises on busy nights, but It was not enough to keep me awake, and I am a light sleeper.  The apartment was beautiful and comfortable.  Would definitely recommend."
2675211,444654325,4/28/2019,"Nice, very centrally located apartment, and Rayne is easy to communicate with. The place is a very good basis for a stay in Dublin, right on the river and close to everything. The apartment is cosy, not luxurious but comfortable, and Rayne, although she is not in Dublin herself is a pleasant host and the flat has some nice personal touches. Theres no TV, not that thats important and the noise from the street can get a bit loud. All in all a nice place to stay in the heart of the city."
2675211,449763929,5/7/2019,Location is great. So close to Temple Bar. Everything in walking distance. Communication is good too
2675211,450367522,5/9/2019,"We had a great stay at Rayne's apartment, it is in a really central location and was the perfect base for our 2 nights in Dublin. The apartment is spacious with some really nice touches, Rayne's tips about places to visit were great. Would definitely stay again next time we are in Dublin."
2675211,454062609,5/17/2019,"PROS: Rayne's apartment is PERFECTLY located near many shops and restaurants in Dublin. We walked everywhere we needed to. The home is beautifully decorated and as charming as any artist's retreat could be. The bed was comfortable and warm, as was the space itself. She has every kitchen gadget necessary, which helped keep food costs lower than expected. Overall, I would definitely stay at Rayne's apartment in the future! (P.S. Make sure you visit Queen of Tarts!! We went there three different times and brought some scones back to Rayne's place to enjoy with breakfast the next morning.) 

HICCUPS: I missed the memo when booking that there is no parking at the location. We rented a car (which I highly recommend you do-- it allowed us to get to Bray, Howth and Galway during our visit fairly easily). I emailed Rayne's team to find out their suggestions, and they named two applications that weren't very helpful. Ultimately, we ended up in the Jervis parking garage, which was conveniently located near the apartment. However, it was nearly $200 to park there on and off for a week. Worth the expense, but I hadn't anticipated it when booking. Also, finding the apartment can be a bit tricky. The lock box isn't where you'd expect it to be and the directions weren't entirely clear. BUT we called Rayne's team and they helped navigate us to it right away! The apartment is located across from a fairly noisy bar. My boyfriend and I sleep through pretty much anything so it was in no way a ""con"" for us, but bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Rayne was also kind enough to supply us with some!"
2675211,456315176,5/21/2019,"Great apartment in terrific location to pubs, restaurants and key attractions.

Very clean, good cooking facilities, good local tips.

Bedroom is noisy as is across from late night venue but was nice to hear the locals enjoying themselves."
2675211,457544437,5/24/2019,"Great location and stylish apartment. The restaurant recommendations were incredible, and we would stay there again."
2675211,458768028,5/26/2019,"Perfect location, easy walking distance to so many places.  This place was just perfect!"
2675211,460439452,5/29/2019,"Rayne's apartment is wonderful, and its location cannot be beaten. It is in the center of everything, with easy walking access to everything.

If you are a light sleeper, I would recommend bringing earplugs to be on the safe side,  but we didn't have any and were fine (we even overslept one day due to jet lag).

The apartment is beautiful and perfect for two people, and Rayne provides a bunch of useful recommendations for great places to go for food and drinks. 

We would definitely stay here again!"
2675211,461384015,5/31/2019,"Perfect location. Temple Bar just across the bridge. Short walk to all the sights. Good restaurants nearby. Spacious apartment. Easy checkin. Noise not a problem, at least during the week."
2675211,462837779,6/2/2019,"Wonderful place, very cosy and exceptionally clean. We had a lovely weekend break here. Felt very safe and bed was comfy. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Will definitely return :)"
2675211,463853302,6/4/2019,Great apartment. Great venue. Overall fantastic. Thank you! :)
2675211,465760979,6/8/2019,Great location to experience downtown (Website hidden by Airbnb) can get a little noisy as noted by Rayne in her description.
2675211,468335954,6/12/2019,"We stayed at Rayne's place for 4 nights and found the apartment very clean and spacious. Location wise, it's perfect and provides value for money and the insider tips was much appreciated. To be honest, on Saturday night the pubs were a bit rowdy but that is to be expected in the general area. For a young couple such as us, this exceeded all our needs."
2675211,471862004,6/18/2019,"Great location, spacious flat."
2675211,474420528,6/23/2019,Easy to find; great location right at the base of The HaPenny Bridge - easy to get around. Nice apartment and nice building. Others have commented on the noise outside at the bars. Wasnt a problem for me but I could see it would be if a light sleeper or not used to city sounds. Highly recommend.
2675211,476031104,6/25/2019,"Cute place, great location. Central to everything."
2675211,480314066,7/2/2019,"A central location, a calming and lovely apartment and a brilliant base to experience Dublin from. 
Rayne was a superb host with quick responses and a fully equipped apartment that is both relaxing, comfortable and right in the centre of all things Dublin.
The hubbub on the street only added to our experience and with the windows closed, allowed for a good nights sleep.
We wouldnt hesitate in recommending this apartment and host!"
2675211,481279327,7/4/2019,"Great, cozy space close to everything! We had a great experience staying at Raynes and would definitely recommend to family or friends and come stay again! Even with close proximity to temple bar district, the noise levels were not a problem at all!"
2675211,483078114,7/7/2019,Great location to enjoy central Dublin ... action. Everything close.
2675211,487822240,7/14/2019,"Very good location in the center of Dublin, at weekends very noisy, but we slept very well anyway. There is a little organic foodstore right beneath the apartment, and Raynes tips for restaurants are worth trying."
2675211,494489164,7/24/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin!
2675211,508041365,8/12/2019,"A really nice flat, very central to most of the tourist sights. Rayne also leaves a booklet with many excellent suggestions on sights, and places to eat and drink. We had no problem checking in. The neighborhood is right in the middle of things, so it can get a little noisy, but keep the windows closed and it's no problem, at least it wasn't for us."
2675211,509978201,8/15/2019,Fabulous location and really thoughtful tips on what to do and where to go to find some local gems. We didnt find it noisy at all the first couple of nights but very noisy on the last night. Luck of the draw I guess depending on who is frequenting nearby bars or restaurants. But otherwise it was so good to be central and we could walk everywhere. Would absolutely recommend Raynes place!!
2675211,511532691,8/17/2019,The apartment was as described and as expected.  We enjoyed the location very much.  It does not have ac bit I opened the windows at night. The noise of the street did not bother us. I would recommend this place!
2675211,515755509,8/23/2019,Amazing location! A tad bit noisy if you have the window open but its not awful. Great place to stay!
2675211,521930334,9/1/2019,"This is an excellent place to stay; clean, comfortable and in such a vibrant location. The guide Rayne put together on the table with little tips for restaurants and daytrips and things was also really helpful (and it also seems like she has a first rate taste in books)."
2675211,523784514,9/4/2019,Great space within walking distance to all the major spots in Dublin.

Location: in the heart of the city but nestled just enough to give you peace and quite and a good nights sleep
- There was an abundance of extras in the apartment such as towels, blankets, toiletries and plug converters
- Looked just like the photos: cute, clean and cozy"
2684689,419072208,3/3/2019,"A great apartment in central Dublin, only a short walk to Dublin Castle, City Hall and  Christ Church Cathedral. The host was very helpful, providing tips on local restaurants and attractions. Excellent flexibility with check-in and check-out. Overall a great stay!"
2684689,422908632,3/12/2019,Great apartment in safe and fashionable neighborhood.  Kate was an excellent communicator leading up to the rental period.   She also has added some nice touches around the apartment including a compilation of sites and restaurants to visit and a cupboard full of necessities.
2684689,423155538,3/13/2019,Kate has a lovely space and has really gone above and beyond with making it feel homey. It is well decorated and centrally located to all the hot spots in Dublin.

2684689,425479167,3/18/2019,"Stop reading reviews and just book it! We could not have asked for a better location and Kate was only a quick text away with questions. I would 100% stay here again and recommend  it to friends. Easily walkable to Guinness, Trinity, Christchurch and Temple Bar (among many other attractions). There was plenty of shampoo and other personal care items and the towels were soft and fluffy! Thanks for a wonderful stay Kate!"
2684689,425897533,3/19/2019,"Kates place is in a beautiful location of Dublin right by the Temple Bar area with lots of things to do and see.

Thank you so much Kate!"
2684689,426559286,3/21/2019,We absolutely loved our short stay at Kate's place.  She is quick to  communicate and was absolutely great!  Loved the location- just perfect for exploring Dublin's major sites.  Our stay could not have been better and we hope to make it back to Dublin and stay at Kate's place again soon!
2684689,427263570,3/23/2019,"Location, location, location! You are in Temple Bar, but not in the thick of it. I made the mistake of staying at a hotel in Temple Bar two years ago and regretted it. The noise was horrible. This apartment is in an ideal location. You can be in the heart of Temple Bar in a matter of minutes.
This was the last place we stayed after two weeks in Ireland. All at Air BnBs. What we loved? Top sheets, luxury towels, a functioning washing machine, an elevator and many mirrors! That may sound odd, but three women and one bathroom? It helped to have several options for getting ready. We didnt find that at most places. Kate also met us when we arrived and was very quick to respond to messages.  I will be returning!"
2684689,427904733,3/24/2019,"Staying at Kate's place was lovely! The location was fantastic, the place was wonderful, and she let us check-in early."

It is right in the heart of Dublin with all of the major sites within walking distance. Kate was so easy to work with and gave great descriptions of directions and recommendations. The apartment was very quiet when we were there and had everything we needed - even extra adaptors! Clean, comfortable and close to everything... what else could you ask for?
I would definitely stay here again!"

So central to everything- you can walk pretty much everywhere. Kate is the most amazing host. She met us at the cafe downstairs (try it!) and showed us to the apartment. She was genuine and personable and felt like an old friend in 5 minutes. The apartment has everything you need- shampoo, hair dryer, iron, washer, some snacks. Stay here!! She even went out of her way to leave me a cupcake when she found out it was my Birthday. Thank you for making this trip so special, Kate!!"

2684689,494463128,7/24/2019,Kate is a great host and the appartment is great for 1-2 persons.  She suddenly split the doublebed into two singlebeds when she understood we were two friends renting. She wants whats best for you. And the appartment is clean and in quiet locations even though so close to the lively pubs in the area. Recomended.

2684689,521812825,9/1/2019,"Apartment is well-stocked.  Bedroom has a very comfortable bed.  Bus-stops to major Dublin attractions all around.  Pull-out couch is not comfortable or easy to set up.  We were lucky to have great Dublin weather but this made for a warm apartment.  The noise (construction, seagulls, garbage bins, car alarms) and lighting coming in from the alley was an issue for us at night."
2684689,523697419,9/4/2019,Kate is a great host and her apartment won't disappoint. Great location in the centre. Fantastic bakery nearby and a Queen of Tarts too. Would most definitely visit again.

The space was clean and lovely, great value and within walking distances to many wonderful attractions.

So grateful for Kates hospitality, we hope to visit Dublin again soon!"

Great location we walked everywhere!!"
2684689,564212135,11/15/2019,"Kate was extremely responsive and gave us a warm welcome and went as far as meeting us on the street and helping us with our bags. The apartment was in a great location, within walking distance to many good attractions, bars, restaurants, etc. In the room Kate was prepared with maps, directions, and instructions on how to use appliances within the apartment which was really thoughtful. The apartment has definitely been lived in and maybe the photos should be updated to reflect the current state particularly the bathroom."
2684689,566007398,11/18/2019,Excellent location and very friendly and quick response from host!

2685836,427862185,3/24/2019,"Mary was a lovely host ì¬†outstanding hospitality and lovely to have a chat to (but the accommodation is quite independent too with a separate bathroom etc, so it's quite possible to stay out of each other's way). The area is also really nice with plenty of good coffee shops and restaurants nearby, as well as buses and the light rail. Would recommend!"
2685836,446872539,5/2/2019,Perfect access to center ciry
2685836,452557098,5/13/2019,The house is just the same as the descrption say and is well located for visiting the city center by walk or by public transportation.

2685836,460098052,5/28/2019,"Beautiful place in a great location! Very close to the team and city center. Host is really nice and had great suggestions, but we got the impression that she had some bad guests before and that was a little stressful. Also not sure if the bathroom was shared or not. Over all very lovely!"

2685836,478977311,6/30/2019,"Mary's house is located in a lovely neighbourhood, about 20 min away from the city center. The bedroom and bathroom were perfectly clean, light breakfast was provided, and Mary gave us some very good tips about things do around Dublin. We had a great time!"
2685836,483121402,7/7/2019,"Thank you very much for having us, we enjoyed a lot! Self check in instruction were perfect, location was great, not far from the city center but in a nice and quiet neighborhood!"

2685836,530087789,9/15/2019,Mary's home is well situated and we felt very welcome.  Stayed twice so that says a lot. Mary is a charming host.
2685836,532806122,9/20/2019,Really good
2685836,535899510,9/25/2019,"Mary is a very nice person and I am glad to stay at her place. I really liked . It felt so good to stay at her place. Especially, the small touches made to her home are so good. For example, the smart mirror, fountain tap, stacked appliances in the kitchen are all so striking. I recommend anyone to to stay at her place."
2685836,536805664,9/27/2019,Sehr gut
2685836,547539896,10/15/2019,"Mary was super sweet and made us feel so welcome! Her home is very stylish and close to town with plenty to do within walking distance. While we thought we would have the place to ourselves like in the description, Mary was there along with us, but we are so glad to have met her. Would love to stay again if we ever get to return!"
2685836,552344393,10/21/2019,Mary was a wonderful and kind host and we felt immediately welcome in her cozy and clean home! On top of that she provided us with great recommendations for our stay! The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood with restaurants and bars not far away and in 30 minute walking distance from the city.

2688629,421903766,3/10/2019,"The apartment is as advertised, easy check-in and checkout, bigger than it looks too. Great location."
2688629,423841266,3/15/2019,"Ken is an excellent host! He was there to give excellent advice and his vast knowledge of Dublin and history of the city was a big help in deciding where to spend time during my short stay.
I highly recommend his place and would stay there again when visiting Dublin."
2688629,426170624,3/20/2019,"Great location less than 10 minute walk to Stephens Green, very nice/clean/spacious place, and Ken is very friendly and helpful! Definitely recommend and would stay here again"
2688629,427327168,3/23/2019,"Ken was a great host! He responded quickly to the booking request and his place was exactly as described. It was clean, spacious, and in a wonderful location. He even brought us some Guinness to welcome us to his home!"
2688629,430081015,3/29/2019,The host canceled this reservation 83 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2688629,431618816,4/1/2019,Good location. House has lots of character. Kitchen ceiling is a bit low for tall people.  The host (Ken) was really helpful with quick response to queries/requests.  Ken also gave good advice for things to do.
2688629,437824990,4/15/2019,This place is in such an amazing location. It was so easy to walk to great spots. Ken was extremely communicative and did a great job letting us know how we could check in even if it was in the middle of the night that our flight arrived. The home is really unique and an incredibly comfortable place to sleep at...best nights sleep for an exhausted traveler. I would definitely stay here again.
2688629,441864677,4/22/2019,AVOID
2688629,448616928,5/5/2019,"Gorgeous flat, easy to get to from the airport bus, nice and central and so much bigger than we expected!
We came to Dublin for a wedding and everything was within walking distance (even in heels!)
Ken had great communication and helped us when needed!"
2688629,451873960,5/12/2019,Ken is helpful with local insight into the orientation of Dublin City.
2688629,453556252,5/16/2019,"Fabulous location within walking distance to everything.  Shops and restaurants nearby.  Huge and luxurious bathroom. Very quiet at night on a beautiful street near Merrion Square. Comfortable bed.  Kitchen is large but under equipped for preparing even simple meals- no sharpe knife, stirring spoons, spatulas, etc. that we could find.  No water glasses or plates except two small saucers."
2688629,458032160,5/25/2019,"Very pretty spot and youll especially love the bathroom.  Great location to the city, museums, galleries and Grafton Street.  Would stay here again when I return.  Everything was exactly as advertised and Ken is a very friendly host with lots of information!"
2688629,459998120,5/28/2019,"So....Ken is possibly the best Airbnb host Ive met.  He was gracious, funny, helpful and a blast to hang out with.  His place is in the PERFECT spot for touring and seeing lots of Dublin.  
He is a true Irishman.  Loves to tell a good story and if youre nice enough he may even grab a pint with ya.   
If you get the chance to stay at his place you will not regret it."
2688629,463904419,6/4/2019,"Kens place is in a great, quiet, neighborhood, on a street of old beautiful Georgian townhouses. Its only a couple of blocks from services including grocery stores, coffee shops and  some must visit bars, as well as the 2 great city parks of Merrion Square and Stephens Green. At the same time its only about a 15 min walk from the tourist hot spots and shops. 

The place itself is huge and comfortable. Its an apartment that as a New Yorker I would live in full time. The bathroom alone is practically the size our bedroom at home. There was also a foyer, which  Im not sure was pictured, that was great for leaving wet shoes and jackets. It is a basement apartment so do be aware that there are only windows in the living room if thats something you care about.

Ken was great. He came out to welcome us and was communicative and responsive. He gave us some great local recommendations."
2688629,465125374,6/7/2019,"Great location, big space, kitchen poorly equipped, comfy bed."
2688629,467941504,6/11/2019,Great location and easy check in!! Ken was friendly and helpful.
2688629,469345881,6/14/2019,Standard accommodation. Ideal location.
2688629,472811897,6/20/2019,Ken's place is situated exactly where you want to be in Dublin!
2688629,477940801,6/29/2019,"Nice basement apartment in a Georgian house within 15-20 min walk of most of Dublins highlights. Pubs, grocery stores and bakeries are all close, but the location was still quiet and restful. Two of the citys most atmospheric pubs are 3-5 minutes away. (Doheny & Nesbit and Toners). Easy airport access on the #757 Dublin express bus. (11 euros return ticket). The owners family lives upstairs but they honor your privacy."
2688629,483192456,7/7/2019,"The flat was ideally located to the fun parts of Dublin, all within walking distance, Stephens Green, Temple Bar, Grafton street, Trinity College, St. Patricks Cathedral, Christ Church, etc. The kitchen needed a few more dishes, flatware and pots but it was still functional. Stove, fridge, microwave, kettle but I wouldnt try cooking any big meals. The bed took up the entire bedroom requiring one to scramble over the bed lengthwise in order in get in and there was no room to store your unpacked luggage. On a positive note the bathroom was exceptional, newly renovated, super large with relatively new toilet, shower, sink and a large soaked tub. Decent Wifi as well. Id recommend this place for shorter stays. Overall it was okay."
2688629,485774656,7/11/2019,"Excellent spot - so close to everything, and a really lovely apartment! Had a great stay - thanks!!"
2688629,495522428,7/26/2019,The host canceled this reservation 234 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2688629,502029372,8/4/2019,"As described, easy to find, easy check in. Ken is a great host and is there when you need him. he bought us homemade scones!! Fabulous location for exploring Dublin!"
2688629,518224592,8/26/2019,Ken's place was such a welcome refuge while trying to find long-term accomodation. The location is excellent and he was so very helpful during check in and throughout my stay. It's hard to find a bathroom as nice as this one anywhere in Dublin!!
2688629,522504031,9/2/2019,"The location was perfect and felt central to everything we wanted to see. The check-in process was seamless and Ken met with us outside to let us in, which was very helpful considering our jet-lag and disorientation. Ken was also very helpful with recommendations and gave us a good and swift tour of the space with information about the amenities, which was really appreciated. The space was large (as expected from photos) and it had everything we needed. 

There were a couple less than satisfactory components to our stay; one being Ken's responsiveness/communication during our stay (there were a couple issues that needed to be addressed and we were unable to get ahold of Ken when we needed to). The bathroom (shower and tub) wasn't as clean as we would have liked, but this wasn't a major issue for us. Lastly, there was a lot of noise/music from the host's apartment above us until about midnight (or later) one of the evenings, which wasn't ideal. 

Ken was very kind and we enjoyed most of our stay.  Ultimately, the space provided what we needed."
2688629,525235054,9/7/2019,Superb! So comfortable and relaxing and convenient to downtown Dublin.
2688629,526640150,9/9/2019,"The apartment was clean, spacious and in a great location. Ken was really helpful and the check-in process was nice and easy"
2688629,529164091,9/14/2019,"This basement flat is a great place to stay if you're looking to be in walking distance to all the sights but not be in the noisy Temple Bar area.  There are lots of pubs and restaurants nearby and a Spar just around the corner. As other reviewers have pointed out the sleeping space is very tight, but once you get in the bed is comfy with a firm mattress.    The kitchen could do with a refresh but is adequate for a quick breakfast. Both the Airlink and Aircoach express buses from Dublin Airport have stops very close by. We used Airlink and had only a 10 minute walk to the flat. Ken is very friendly and will offer suggestions on places to visit and where to eat if you ask"
2688629,530882133,9/16/2019,"Huge apartment with great location. Easily a ten to twenty minute walk to most places in Dublin. Ken was available to answer any questions we had very quickly. Free street parking available on Saturday and Sunday, but metered during the week (could get pricey for parking if staying during the week- unsure if better alternatives exist for that). Had a wonderful stay here!"
2688629,532219060,9/19/2019,The apartment has a certain amount of charm like it's owner. As much as I like to recommend it  i would not stay again. The apartment has no ventilation is old has musty smell. Small bedroom and no way to make coffee. Not a good value at all.
2688629,536197495,9/26/2019,"Wonderful location in walking distance that everything in Dublin has to offer. A quiet place to stay in on a beautiful street. The apartment is spacious and well maintained. The bathroom is huge, the bed was comfortable and the outside sitting area was great! The biggest bonus was meeting Ken. Truly a wonderful host! Irish hospitality at its best. His kindness, wit and Irish humor made my stay. I absolutely recommend his place."
2688629,542170493,10/6/2019,"A great apartment in a great neighbourhood. Was here for over a week and it really felt like a home away from home. It's perfect î right in the coolest part of Dublin, and everything seems like just a short walk away, and public transit is right there too. That Georgian architecture never gets old. And I just gotta say î that bed was really comfortable."
2688629,546998960,10/14/2019,"We had a great time staying at Ken's apartment. It's centrally located for easy walking to Trinity College, the National Gallery, Merrion Square and so many other attractions. The apartment was quiet and perfect for resting after a long day of running around. When we arrived Ken even took us for a coffee and a pint to welcome us. We'll definitely be back again."
2688629,551349562,10/20/2019,"Great location and phenomenal host. Ken is the absolute best - he was so generous with his time and conversation. Roomy flat, huge bathroom, and comfy bed. I almost want to go back to Dublin just to stay here again!"

2743564,437109683,4/14/2019,Beautiful house close to the beach in a lovely little coastal town. Phillipa and her family were very kind and helpful. We were allowed to use the Kitchen and even the food. We would definitely come back.
2743564,443103867,4/25/2019,"Without a doubt my best AirBnB experience! 

My friend and I were made to feel extremely welcome in Philippas house, every member of the family was genuine, friendly and made the effort to make us feel at home and provide recommendations on things to do/places to see. Philippa was flexible with our check-in and check-out times which was really appreciated as we arrived late at Dublin airport - nothing was too much trouble. 

The house was incredible, clean and very well presented, the room itself too was a good size for two and we were invited to use the kitchen (including cooking) and conservatory space as desired. 

Im unsure how many bathrooms the house has in total, but it almost felt like we had exclusive use to the adjacent bathroom because it was rarely used by the family - again, amazing standards and very clean, modern and stylish. 

As we had hired a car the location was ideal, with good road access to Dublin (30mins) and Belfast (2 hours). We didnt have an opportunity to use the local transport links but from what the family told us, and from reading previous guest experiences its easy enough to get around without a hire car. 

Some great added touches like glass of water and chocolate for our arrival. 

I would absolutely stay again, and recommend to anyone visiting the area. Thank you Philippa and family for having us!"

2743564,529214635,9/14/2019,"If I could write a glowing 10 star review for our stay with Phillipa I would.  If you are looking for a quiet place to stay by the sea outside of Dublin then Phillipa's home in Rush  is the place for you. 

Phillipa is the most warm and welcoming host you could ask for.   She is knowledgeable about Dublin, transportation and offers many helpful tips that made our visit in the city easier and more fun.  She recommended the Epic Museum which was the highlight of the places we visited.

We cooked dinner one night and were made to feel right at home in the kitchen.  

I will echo the comments of an earlier reviewer and say that it was by far the best Airbnb experience I have ever had.  By far!

One note is that you really do need a car or be ready to walk.  The train station is a good 15 minute walk and the walk into the village is about 20-25 minutes.   

We loved staying here!!  Thank you Phillipa!

Diane and Zack"

Note to anyone not used to using smaller European washer/dryers they do not hold a lot and take FOREVER to wash and dry a load of clothes. This is NOT a negative mark on the apartment as its just the way things are there.  Maeve was great and she was always very prompt on her replies! She helped settle us in and answered all of our questions. The apartment had a great view of the castle, and the unit is located with easy walking distance of many local pubs and restaurants."
2791857,452885831,5/14/2019,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and could not have asked for better hosts!! Maeve and Ken are so sweet, hospitable, and offer helpful tips for seeing the city and the country in general. Amazing experience!!!!"

The hosts provide excellent guidance about Dublin, instructions about public transportation (including a bus card with a discount), and information about shopping in town. And can tell much about Ireland's history and current events. Plus, being world travelers, Maeve and Ken are curious about other cultures. Very nice.
 Their residence is spacious and modern, and the guestrooms are clean and comfortable with several amenities. In the mornings, Maeve and Ken offer a substantial breakfast. A great opportunity for interactions between hosts and guests. 
The location is very good with a drugstore, convenience stores and a pub nearby. It is accessible to the city center with a bus, whose stop is about 100 feet from the house. Very convenient and practical. 
 Dublin is a vibrant city that combines Ireland's tradition and modernity.
 My visit to Dublin was very pleasant thanks to Maeve and Ken's hospitality. Their lovely place is highly recommended."
2791857,471417151,6/17/2019,Great place to stay in great location. Marvel and Ken did everything they could to make us feel at home. Our room was spotless and comfy and they went the extra mile in many ways to ensure our stay was wonderful.

2791857,480216769,7/2/2019,"I highly recommend staying at Maeve & Kens Airbnb. It was such a perfect stay. Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The place is located right across the street from multiple bus stops so you can access just about anywhere from there. There is also a nice shopping center right up the street, about a 5-10 minute walk, very convenient. They gave me a great recommendation to go to Malahide and Howth and even wrote out directions for me, ended up being one of my favorite places I saw! Only bad thing I could say is that if you are a light sleeper, bring some earplugs as this room is located right by the front door. Was not a problem for me but if other guest are coming home loudly at night, it might be problem for you. Overall, I had an amazing stay 10/10!"
2791857,481201437,7/4/2019,"Above and beyond hospitality!

2791857,491635686,7/20/2019,"Maeve and Ken had a fantastic space for travelers wanting to experience Dublin. We were grateful for the separate space we had. While it was a room and bathroom within the house, we were given our own keys, so we could come in and out of the house very easily. Breakfast was a delicious spread laid out in the kitchen every morning, and tea/coffee was regularly offered. We would highly recommend staying here, whether you're staying or passing through Dublin."

As the other reviews mention, the location is ideal between the airport and city center. Bus was convenient and the fare cards provided by Maeve and Ken were helpful and even had some money loaded on them from the last guests.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying with them when you visit Dublin!"
2791857,545479011,10/12/2019,They responded to all our queries fast even before booking and after as well. It was very easy to get to their house from their airport. There is a bus stop right outside the door. Bus for the airport and also for the city is always available from that stop. We stayed for 2 days and both days were very comfortable in terms of the breakfast and the room. Maeve and Ken were both kind enough to share about the city and they were always eager to make our stay best. Would definitely visit again and recommend!!!
2791857,546897495,10/14/2019,nice to be a short bus ride from the city center and not in the middle of the hustle and bustle.
2791857,548333876,10/17/2019,Just spent two nights with Maeve and Ken Gavin. We couldnt have been treated better with a warm welcome and many chats over the two days. Everything just perfect. Lovely ambiance and comfortable sitting room for guests. Would highly recommend a stay at the Gavins.

Definitely a great place to see when visiting Dublin!"
2832333,431644497,4/1/2019,Deborahs space was immaculately clean and so welcoming coming off of 18 hours of travel with a toddler. We enjoyed the comforts of their beautiful home. They had clean cozy sheets and luxurious duvets on every bed with fresh towels. The space was well decorated and cozy for our family of four. Our little girls had books to read and a pack n play to sleep in. Thank you for making our time in Dublin so special. I highly recommend Deborahs place and hope we can return sometime in the future.
2832333,434040210,4/7/2019,"Superbly designed and comfortable house, easy travel to the city and nearby amenities. Wonderful communication and support from Deborah and sultan, cant recommend highly enough!"

We had a wonderful time staying at the property and we didnt have to contact our host during our stay as everything was in very good order and detailed instructions were left at the counter. The place was tastefully decorated with all the amenities you need. We strongly recommend this place which is so close to so many wonderful cafes, restaurants and tourist attractions."
2832333,438688632,4/17/2019,BEAUTIFUL home within walking distance of everything you need in Dublin.  Far exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely be coming back.
2832333,444159065,4/27/2019,"Our family of three had a wonderful week-long stay at Deborah and Ultan's lovely house in Dublin's vibrant and homey Portobello neighborhood!  The historic home has been beautifully restored and decorated, and was tricked out with everything we could possibly need during our week long stay.  We loved hanging out in the comfy living room looking out the wall of glass windows to the sweet brick walled garden, where the sounds of birdsong were all we heard. The house feels very private, as it's tucked away down a  little lane up the road a few steps from the very pretty Grand Canal (which has a nice path for walks or biking) and we heard no city noises, even though all the basic needs (i.e. grocery, pharmacy, cafes, restaurants, pubs, bakery, butcher shop, etc. ) are just a few blocks away.  It's within easy walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, and we found that the traditional tourist attractions like Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christchurch Cathedral, the Gaol, Temple Bar, etc. all were about a 10 minute taxi ride away.   The home's interior is truly lovely--the design is very pretty and hip, and there are lots of interesting things to look at, but it's also super homey and easy to live in. The beds were very comfy, and the charming kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to cook breakfasts, have snacks and drinks, and prepare a few main meals when we wanted a break from restaurant dinners.  Deborah and Ultan were extremely responsive to all our questions and requests for info and help both before and during our stay, and we found all their recommendations for restaurants, cafes, etc. to be spot on.  The house is a little gem in a very cool neighborhood, and we could not have been happier with our stay--it was very hard to leave!!"
2832333,445994495,4/30/2019,A perfect place to relax after a busy day! Kick back and listen to the birds singing in your private garden! You'll forget you are in the middle of a city!
2832333,449342945,5/6/2019,Amazing from start to finish. Beautiful house and Deborah couldnt have responded any quicker to the questions I had
2832333,452910971,5/14/2019,"Fabulous place. Very spacious. Deborah was extremely helpful, attentive, and responsive."
2832333,455906922,5/20/2019,"Deborah and Ultan,
We absolutely loved the house in Portobello!  It was everything as described and more.  The space was more than ample for 5 adults.  The house location was perfect to walk to most places or to the bus stop.  We loved the atmosphere of the home which made it great to come back to after a day of exploration to rest and visit with each other.  Clean, smartly decorated, we would love to stay again!  Thank you so much!"
2832333,458753988,5/26/2019,"This home was lovely for a few days in Dublin! Very stylish, clean, and in an awesome, non-touristy neighborhood. Thanks for having us!"
2832333,460531437,5/29/2019,"This home lacks nothing! Perfect space, perfect location, perfect hostess!
We arrived earlier than expected from Galway and Deborah was kind enough to let us store our bags in the home and directed us to a fabulous spot for brunch. The house is so quiet, the few sounds we heard from outside included the birds singing away in the lush greenery.  There is absolutely everything in the house, it is beautifully laid out with an amazing use of space. The garden was a favorite spot when the sun finally showed up! The beds were all comfortable. There were six of us, and we never felt cramped. As far as location, this was a perfect spot as we did not want to be in the center of the city, this was close enough to walk if we opted, or a very short taxi drive away from all the amazing things Dublin has to offer. 
Overall, a wonderful experience!"
2832333,462825313,6/2/2019,This house is stunning. Its very clean and has all the comforts of home. Deborah is easy to communicate with and provides great tips for local activities and restaurants. We were walking distance from town and it was the perfect location. You will love this place!
2832333,470374067,6/16/2019,As promised. We were 6 old friend traveling together and it worked out well with this town house. Easy to access and in walking distance from City center (20-30 min). Very good communication with host.
2832333,479767991,7/1/2019,Do it!
2832333,487673090,7/14/2019,Great place to stay! Very welcoming home environment and had all the necessary amenities for daily life.

2832333,493332838,7/22/2019,Everything was perfect and we had a wonderful time in Dublin. Deborah organized everything very uncomplicated and the house felt like a real home to us. The size is really good for up to 6 people. Thanks again Deborah for the good time :)

2832333,502065360,8/4/2019,Lovely townhouse! The perfect way to start our Dublin vacation! Our entire family enjoyed it very much.
2832333,505363556,8/9/2019,Great location and very comfortable space for my family. There are little considerate touches around the home that are very appreciated. I would not hesitate to book here again in the future.

2832333,518336779,8/26/2019,We loved our stay in Deborah's house! The house was lovely and clean and had everything we needed. It is in a fabulous location very close to the downtown core and sights yet in a terrific local neighbourhood with a fabulous feel. We would highly recommend staying there while visiting Dublin.
2832333,520925737,8/31/2019,Comfortable stay within easy walking distance of all of the sights in Dublin. Deborah's recommendations for restaurants/sightseeing were also spot on.
2832333,523810865,9/4/2019,"Deborah was such a wonderful host, always available to answer any questions within minutes! Deborahs home was comfortable, well equipped and in a great location. The home was very clean, organized and beautifully decorated. It accommodated our large group of 6 adults and two children comfortably. We enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!"
2832333,531417088,9/17/2019,"Very comfortable, clean, and stylish. Close to Dublin center but very quiet and secluded. Great place to stay!"
2832333,534976455,9/23/2019,"Overall, this is a lovely property in a quiet, residential part of Dublin.

We had a slight disagreement with Deborah in that she felt that we didn't care for her home in the way she expected.
In her welcome book, she had mentioned the importance of her terrazzo floor. We were very cognisant of this and felt like we did a good job keeping it as she expected (sweeping the floor and immediately cleaning any spills) but when it came to check out, Deborah was not happy with how it was left. Unfortunately, it was a wet weekend in Dublin when we were there, and so in hindsight there may have been inadvertent (and to our mind, invisible) footprint stains left behind that we didn't see.
We apologised for this and we do recognise that Deborah is a better judge of her terrazzo floor and we hope it's all ok now.

For the right people, this is a fab property but just be cognisant that this is a quiet, residential area and that the terrazzo floor should be well looked after."
2832333,538880080,9/30/2019,House was spot on. Host was even able to help sort an issue my in laws caused for themselves.
2832333,543747129,10/8/2019,Wonderful stay. They were so accommodating to our family. Beautiful home that was very cozy.
2832333,556424517,10/29/2019,"Wow. This place was great! Deborah is a fantastic host, and the house itself is lovely: tastefully decorated, close to everything, comfortable, and even fun (check out the 80s Alphabet on the wall upstairs!). I had to work a lot this trip, unexpectedly, and it was a comfortable place to do that, too!"
2832333,558700262,11/3/2019,"We really enjoyed staying at Deborah's.  The place was very cosy, well situated, and gave us a welcomed break from the hustle and bustle of Dublin.  Would definitely recommend."
2842486,424921574,3/17/2019,"Great location, only around 20minutes from the airport and close to town. Tom was great in allowing us to complete a late check in."
2842486,437864847,4/15/2019,"Everything as described, clean and tidy. Helpful tips, good public transport or 20-30min by foot into the city centre. Neighborhood was very quiet. Would book again"
2842486,441931395,4/22/2019,"The apartment is located in a nice area close to the Modern Art Museum and Kilmnham Goal,not far from Phoenix Park,well connected with buses and Luas to the city centre.Tom is a very friendly host.He welcomed us at night giving us a lot of info. Perfect for a couple.The bathroom was very clean but the heating water system and flush too noisy.The kitchen should be a bit better equipped and the wardrobe was very dusty."
2842486,462826448,6/2/2019,"Tom's son met us at the apartment very late at night due to our plane being delayed which was great. The flat was ok, the bed was rather small and uncomfortable, the couch was too. It could have been cleaner. Communication could have been better, we Airbnb messaged him and didn't get a response back for a couple of days which worried us, however after sending  an SMS a reply was quicker."
2842486,469881940,6/15/2019,"Tom was very hospitable host.

Accommodating to our very late check-in time,he personally came by to ensure that we had everything we needed as well as provided tips and guidance for our stay.

The house itself is easily accessible by either the bus,or the tram service - which is just a short walk away. You can expect about a 20-30mins travel time to city center.

There is a small grocery store to address your needs too.

The amenities such as the water heater and radiator were a little old,but Tom was quick to guide us on operating them."
2842486,471802794,6/18/2019,Be prepared to overlook things and adjust your expectations accordingly so as not to spoil your holidays.
2842486,474613071,6/23/2019,The flat was very clean and tidy and communication for check-in and out was great! The flat is across the street from a bus stop that takes you straight into the city centre. Pretty close by by taxi as well. Great stay!
2842486,539381974,10/1/2019,"The place itself is lovely but the host is not quite responsive. Moreover they request the extra electricity charges in cash (which is not allowed by Airbnb). I managed to pay this over the app and I would suggest that others request the same. Location is good though, about 20 minutes from the city centre."
2862881,466601054,6/9/2019,"Beautiful place, awesome location, and great price!  The host was so sweet and even provided some snacks for us in the room on arrival and had milk and juice stocked in the fridge.  We felt very safe having a key to enter the building and to enter the room.  The kitchen was great with updated appliances and well stocked with glasses, mugs, plates, and utensils.  I can't say enough great things about this place, we were so happy with our stay!"
2862881,483278610,7/7/2019,Apartment was lovely. Everyone was very friendly and was in a great location. Will definitely be back.
2862881,497272197,7/28/2019,This is a very well situated place to stay as it is close to the city but not too crowded. Staff were very friendly upon arrival and departure. Facilities were excellent. I would recommend for anyone to stay here.
2862881,514447845,8/21/2019,"Brilliantly located, comfortable apartment and very safe and secure. Very central and close to tourist sights, restaurants and shops but quiet and peaceful. Helpful staff in the building. Would stay there again!"

2862881,538093065,9/29/2019,"Riona was a great host, the apartment is very nice, spatious and modern. The location is great as well! A great experience. On top of that, we were travelling with a smal kid and had no problems whatsoever."
2862881,562098665,11/10/2019,"Me and my two friends had a lovely stay here.
We were able to check in about 5 hours before the original check-in time, which was absolutely great. We were also upgraded to a bigger apartment which extended all of our expectations. Both the standard of the apartment and its location was very good. Riona was quick with her responses and in general very helpful.
We would absolutely recommend others to book a stay here, and would love to come back ourselves!"
2874272,420301698,3/6/2019,"Dont wait to book! 

What a great experience we had at Liam & Fionas location. We were able to get around by walking pretty easily! We were also provided with a top 10 list of things to do while we were in Dublin & the list didnt disappoint! We did literally every single one! We felt like it was home away from home. They had everything you needed to have a comfortable stay. We definitely are already planning to come back again!"
2874272,421884823,3/10/2019,This space is perfect for anyone wanting something economical but still close to the city! Love the small space and the beautiful view!

2874272,423821325,3/15/2019,"We had beautiful time in Dublin. We really loved to be there.

The apartment is absolutely perfect and very well-located. There was everything what is needed during a holiday.

We got a lot of hints about the places, restaurants, pubs, shops, public transportation etc. It was very useful.

The communication was fast and easy with them.

We highly recommend them and their apartment."
2874272,429943663,3/29/2019,"Great hosts and a nice little place.  They provided excellent notes on nearby restaurants, transit links, sites of interest, suggestions on live music venues, etc.  Really wonderful stay!"
2874272,437205583,4/14/2019,"Relatively close to city centre, had everything you need for your stay, and near stores to buy any extras."
2874272,442444356,4/23/2019,Since I have nothing positive to say. I best say nothing at all.
2874272,443214458,4/25/2019,This is a value for money apartment easy to get  to and comfortable
2874272,446780898,5/2/2019,"This was where we stayed on our first night in Ireland. Comfortable, clean, well located close enough to walk to many attractions but far enough away as well! Thank you Liam and Fiona!"

2874272,478761434,6/30/2019,We had a lovely time in Dublin and the location was perfect. Walkable to all sightseeing venues.
2874272,491532706,7/20/2019,Had a wonderful time at Liam and Fiona's place.  Fully equipped and very clean.
2874272,524557021,9/6/2019,"Liam was very friendly, apartment was very clean and good walking distance to town, would definitely stay again, thanks!"
2874272,530031226,9/15/2019,Great apartment - compact space equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Good location to explore city by foot and with easy access to bus routes.
2874272,534831708,9/23/2019,Fantastic place and location! Thank you Liam and Fiona!
2874272,537831080,9/29/2019,Slightly removed from the city in a cute neighborhood.  Great walking distance to Jameson and Phoenix Park. A few great pubs and restaurants in the surrounding area.
2874272,545440649,10/12/2019,Cute little studio apartment. A little further from main attractions in Dublin so be prepared to walk or pay for a taxi. We had a nice stay but definitely would have liked to be closer to the city!
2874272,563553111,11/13/2019,The apartment is very well connected via the public transport. Due to this I recommend a leap card for visitors.
2891101,425882209,3/19/2019,"Marie's home is comfortable, warm, and extremely cozy. I loved having coffee every morning in the bright kitchen. Marie provides a light breakfast spread which is great. The bedroom had plenty of space for luggage, and the bed was fantastic. Marie's home is very close to the city center, and is within an easy walking distance of the bus stop. I loved my time in Ireland, and staying at Marie's home made it so much better. I have no criticisms, and highly recommend Marie's home to anyone visiting Ireland."
2891101,429239390,3/27/2019,"I cant recommend Maries place highly enough! She was a gracious hostess, gave helpful insights about the city, and checked in with me to make sure I was having a pleasant visit. 11/10!"
2891101,431959412,4/2/2019,"Marie is an excellent host... friendly, helpful and kind. It was a great experience being hosted by Marie. Many thanks "
2891101,446430575,5/1/2019,"Marie is the best host mother I ever met!

I stayed for three weeks,  she was always kind and told me about Dublin.
When I caught a cold, she took care of me.
It was really good to see Marie! Thank you!"
2891101,450802905,5/10/2019,"Amazing place and great location, Marie is so nice and you just feel right at home. I highly recommend this place."
2891101,458722480,5/26/2019,"Marie is lovely and thoughful. The room and her home are clean and bright. Upon arrival she offered tea or coffee and a tour, she had a dublin guide book in the room and was quick to offer suggestions and tips. It was a lovely stay."
2891101,460876616,5/30/2019,Wasnt as close to the city center as thought. But was an OK place to stay.
2891101,463531059,6/3/2019,"Although I spent very little time at the place, Marie was a lovely host. I enjoyed our conversations in the evening when I came home. Her house is in a great location- the buses are easy to navigate and if you choose to walk it takes 15-20 minutes to get into the center of the city.  Marie shows she cares greatly about female travelers which was much appreciated. Thank you for your hospitality, Marie!"
2891101,466596297,6/9/2019,"This was a lovely place to stay, not far from the center of the city but removed enough that it was a bit more quiet and relaxed. Marie was very kind and welcoming, and it was a nice home base to have for my first time traveling to Dublin."
2891101,474733785,6/23/2019,Instructions for the check-in were very clear and detailed. Marie waited to greet me in person a gave me a warm welcome. Overall it was a very homey stay.
2891101,478818973,6/30/2019,"I stayed with Marie for the second time, because öshe  is the perfect host in any respect."
2891101,528064839,9/12/2019,Maries home was in a great location. It was very easy to walk to and from the city center each day. She offers a great breakfast spread each morning and her home is as advertised. I enjoyed chatting with her in the mornings before I left each day.
2891101,560338777,11/6/2019,"Marie is a nice host. If you have any queries she is happy to answer them. I asked for an extra blanket and she provided me with one. You can also cook in the evening. 
The communication with Marie stayed formal. It is a stay for people that are out of the house the whole day and prefer only to have a place to sleep."
2891101,562700778,11/11/2019,"Marie is amazing and I adored staying with her. Her home is cozy and inviting, and the bed is extremely comfortable + comes with extra blankets if you're like me and get cold quite easily.  If it's a good day, it's quite nice to walk to the city centre or the DART, and if not, there are multiple bus stops nearby. As a host, Marie goes above and beyond- she even scheduled a cab for me so I wouldn't have to wait at the bus stop at 3 in the morning. She's incredibly funny, kind, and an overall badass lady, if you'll pardon my swearing. I looked forward to all of our chats, however long or brief they were. The only thing I will say is that the wifi is a bit dodgy up in the room, but honestly I didn't even mind. It really felt as if I was  truly coming to a home away from home every night, and I would book again in a heartbeat! Thank you so much Marie, you're a gem!"
2891101,568132079,11/24/2019,"Maries house just has 30 minutes walking to city center, and there is bus 16 to Dublin airport, its so convenient! In the house, you can find everything you need, and also Marie offers the breakfast. Highly recommend!"
2897424,418495691,3/2/2019,"Very good location, very clean and a good place to stay! Communication was excellent - everything as expected."
2897424,422861779,3/12/2019,The apartment is located in a really cool area and close to the city center. It has a well equipped kitchen (even with dishwasher) and two seperate bedrooms. We felt very comfortable and we were sad to leave the place. Highly recommended!
2897424,426910701,3/22/2019,My husband and I stayed here for two nights as part of our Spring Break trip and loved it! Maria and Marco have done a fantastic job of making the space comfortable and accommodating. It was more spacious than I was expecting and the location was very convenient for what we were wanting to do. We highly recommend staying here to anyone who is visiting the area:).
2897424,436160753,4/12/2019,Close to everything and really helpful hosts.
2897424,443128853,4/25/2019,"Great pizza place less than a minute away, and a convenience store round the corner which were very handy to have close by! Also close distance to key tourist attractions, and the hosts reply to messages very quickly"
2897424,446336777,5/1/2019,Great location and wonderful host.
2897424,453649570,5/16/2019,Very nice place close to City Centre.
2897424,456321827,5/21/2019,Perfect location. Just off the beaten path but within a 15-30 minute walk of all the best Dublin has to offer. Ideal for the few days we spent.
2897424,457132570,5/23/2019,Appartement parfait pour visiter la belle ville de Dublin
2897424,458044819,5/25/2019,"In terms of space and location the apartment couldnt be faulted. Two large double bedrooms - walking distance to everything you need and would want to see as a tourist visiting Dublin. There is also good shops and restaurants immediately out the door. 

The only downside is that although the place is kept generally clean there was mould in the bathroom and second bedroom on the ceiling and the whole place could just do with a little bit of TLC - a lick of paint,  on the walls and door frames, a little money spent on making the amenities more up to date and fresh and just to make the place feel more homely. 

All in all the flat is worth the cost per night - but with a little bit of time and money spent on it it has massive potential to be even better. 

Marco is very communicative, helpful and friendly as a host and gave clear instructions and advice before and throughout our stay."
2897424,460402986,5/29/2019,"WOW! The apartment was great and spacious, very clean and lovely. The outstanding part was the host- I've never felt so welcomed and guided on a trip! I definitely recommend getting a GoDublin pass because the Airlink 747 and the rest of the bus system is a must. Of course, everything is walkable as well but the buses provide greater freedom. I wouldn't hesitate to come back again."
2897424,461932299,6/1/2019,"Very roomy apartment in nice neighbourhood.  Plenty of space with easy access to hop on hop off bus stop, we also walked easily to other sights (Guinness).  Good local pubs close by."
2897424,463442360,6/3/2019,Good spot and nice location.  Thanks for the visit!
2897424,471408823,6/17/2019,This place is near convenient store and markets.  Safe area.  Thank you Marco.
2897424,473317962,6/21/2019,"Very good location, easy access to downtown, hosts are very helpful and answer your questions very quickly. If I went back to Dublin, I would stay at their place again"
2897424,484217590,7/8/2019,"Maria and Marco are wonderful hosts. Their communication is quick and precise. Unfortunately, the apartment itself was not up to par with the description. Although they had described it as fully renovated, it was in the processù when we arrived. There was mold on the walls, especially the bathroom. The bathroom also only had half of a shower door, resulting in a lot of water on the floor after each shower. Another frustration was that the hot water was only readily available in the morning and ran out quickly. If you had to shower at night it must be quick for you have to give the warm water a boostù from the water heater tank. Another downfall was the WiFi. If you are a traveling worker I would not recommend this place for the WiFi was not strong enough for me to work on my computer. Overall, the location was in a decent spot and there was a lot of pubs and restaurants in the area."
2897424,487787958,7/14/2019,"Great location, basic but overall clean and spacious apartment. 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area. No TV or radio. Pubs and 24/7 supermarket with a nice deli counter around the corner. The Glimmerman is a great pub. Watch out with the waterboiler, this does not switch off automatically! If you are a light sleeper I would recommend bringing earplugs although the noise was not to extreme, the street is fairly quiet. Excellent communication from Maria and Marco!"
2897424,498183385,7/29/2019,Maria and Marco are really helpful and made everything so easy. The place is very spacious and relaxing. Great location as you can just walk into the city centre. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
2897424,499838260,8/1/2019,"Conveniently located,  clean and practical, a perfect starting point from which to discover Dublin (make sure to check out the Cobblestone nearby for local music!). The host gave us very detailed directions and was easy to reach for our whole stay."
2897424,510047988,8/15/2019,"Maria and Marco's place was great! About 15-20 minute walk to all the main touristy things (Brazen Head, Temple etc.) but there was a lot of stuff to do right around the apartment too that was great ( we especially enjoyed the Cobblestone (bar)) its about a 30 euro cab trip from the airport but they provide you with instructions on how to take the bus as well for much less and it would have been very hard to figure out without their helpful guidance."
2897424,517361754,8/25/2019,Nice apartment in a cute neighborhood. Loved napping in the recliners after a day of sightseeing! Quick walk for a night out in temple bar and really close to the train station.
2897424,519265686,8/28/2019,A very comfortable apartment not too far away from the centre of Dublin. Hosts very welcoming and quick to communicate if we had any questions.
2897424,522584372,9/2/2019,Maria & Marco were the most responsive hosts I have used. Their place was just as advertised right in the heart of everything a tourist would look for. I will recommend their place to anyone traveling to Dublin!
2897424,523813692,9/4/2019,Good and helpful hosts. Quick to reply. Basic flat but very clean.Good location .
2897424,524707809,9/6/2019,"Apartment is bigger than what you expect. Around the corner, there's  a market where you can get shampoos and other basics if needed."
2903645,466605811,6/9/2019,Very nice stay at Karens. Just as described and extremely clean.
2903645,470661925,6/16/2019,"Karen is a great host, everything was result good. 100% recomendable"
2903645,473221793,6/21/2019,The place is okay but I wouldnt recommend booking for more than one night.
2903645,473808435,6/22/2019,Nice quite place and exceptionally clean house.
2903645,477556035,6/28/2019,"Clean, well furnished and secure room with good internet in a pleasant area of Dublin."
2903645,478994484,6/30/2019,"Pre-booking communication with Karen was excellent and she did me the favour of holding the room until I was home at the weekend to scan in my passport and update my profile on this site.  The location is ideal, only five minutes to the DART station and the house is practically on the seafront with great views of Dublin bay and the coast down to Dun Laoghaire; the village of Sandymount is only a short walk away and there is a circle K station close buy for buying a few bits and pieces.  The house is spotless, the bedroom as well as the bathroom, and the shower is great with good water pressure and a wide range of shampoos, conditioners and shower gels on hand.  I would definitely recommend this room for a good value, short to medium length stay in Dublin.  A kettle to make tea or coffee would be nice and, with no access to the kitchen, a bigger bottle of water for the guests to drink would be practical.  I had a bit of a run in with a cat one night-he bit and scratched me-so I'd advise anyone not to rub him,  but all in all I enjoyed my stay with Karen, so it's a thumbs up and thanks from me."
2903645,481209325,7/4/2019,Karen is a very friendly host. Highly recommended
2903645,524657956,9/6/2019,Karen is a very friendly host. Sparklingly clean. Great location.
2903645,525134669,9/7/2019,Excellent Host. Highly Recommended.
2903645,529974708,9/15/2019,"Karen is a great host! The bedroom in which I was was very clean, as the bathroom I used. Everything was perfect, in particular the communication with Karen. 100% recommended"
2903645,535477959,9/24/2019,"Nice, clean room in great location. Karen is a friendly host."
2920718,553872074,10/25/2019,"Stunning apartment, tidy, clean, stylish, amazing bed, wouldn't change a thing! Would happily stay there again."
2920718,568441208,11/24/2019,Stay was great They have nice and clean rooms. Careful when checking out as anytime after 11Am (even if it is a few minutes) you will be charged
2923471,418484000,3/2/2019,"Great location, so comfortable and so friendly."
2923471,424785190,3/17/2019,"the house is in a great location, the bus stop is nearby! Marie was very kind, made me feel at home!"
2923471,428955534,3/26/2019,"If ever I return to Dublin, I will check to see if Marie has a room available."
2923471,433885110,4/7/2019,"Lovely house and lovely hostess!

You should definitely stay here!"
2923471,442440469,4/23/2019,Marie was a gem! The breakfast was spot on and I'd happily stay again. What a bonus being located right on the canal. It is a straight shot to so many things!
2923471,448518486,5/5/2019,Great place to stay 
2923471,473732996,6/22/2019,Marie is very lovely and her home is cute. The bed is very comfortable and she is so kind to have breakfast placed out on the table in the morning. The area is safe and  over 20 mins by bus to the City Centre. If you plan to leave out early in the morning to the airport by bus check the schedule because many buses dont run early on Saturday and Sunday even later. $3 euro one way on the bus to get to and from the city center. 17-22 min walk to get to the train/tram stations.
2923471,525738481,9/8/2019,Marie is a very nice host. I enjoyed talking to her about Dublin and how people live in Irland. Sie is a retired teacher and I loved participating in her live experience. Thank you and all the best Brigitte
2941009,437214500,4/14/2019,"We spend a great moment in their lovely place! They are very nice!
Super clean, quiet, and lovely place. 
And delicious eggs! 
We recommend for sure!!! :) 
Thank you again for everything."
2941009,457072655,5/23/2019,Fantastic place to stay with perfect hosts - would come back to Dublin just to stay here - and the garden is a hidden gem - six stars!
2941009,460838545,5/30/2019,The Lost BoatHouse is probably one of the nicest AirBnB's I've stayed at. The room and bathroom were gorgeous and it is in an excellent location. I would highly recommend staying here!
2941009,472215982,6/19/2019,"Paul & Stephen's home was absolutely PERFECT for our trip!  It was our first time to Ireland & they made us feel so welcome! At first we thought we would be too far away from everything, but we ended up being able to walk all the way to the Guinness storehouse very easily (about an hour walk though). Easy access to the light rail which takes you to the further side of town. Both Paul & Stephen were great with giving us directions/shortcuts/and restaurant suggestions! They let us drop our bags off early while we waited for our room so we could start exploring & let us leave our bags when we checked out until we got our rental car.  The fresh hen eggs were amazing too! They have such a beautiful home in a quiet location (country feel in the city).  If we ever come back to Dublin we will DEFINITELY be staying here again."
2941009,525786510,9/8/2019,"This accommodation is so good. We had the ensuite room which was exceptionally clean and very spacious. 
Stephen and Paul are very welcoming and helpful but not at all intrusive. 
There was tea and coffee available as well as a toaster and a fridge if you wanted to make your own breakfast.
It's a pleasant walk into the centre of Dublin with Ringsend village very near by.
We had gone to Ireland for the rugby and couldn't have been better situated for the Aviva stadium - literally a stone's throw away.
We would definitely stay with Stephen and Paul again and we will be recommending them to our friends and family."
2965206,449204499,5/6/2019,I had very comfortable time like home in her house.  There is very clean and lovely deco in her house.  Also Noeleen is very kind host! she recommended very beautiful park nearby her home and nice galleries. i wanted to visit good galleries :)  location is good. I can go to city centre in 15 mins and close to dublin air port.  There is nice restaurent nearby her home (Botanic House Restaurant & Bar)  Thanks for staying your home very comfortably!!!
2965206,452471149,5/13/2019,Noeleen is a very kind and welcoming host. I felt at home at all times. Perfect refuge after a long day in the city.
2965206,458700702,5/26/2019,AMAZING host. The breakfast is lovely and helped save a little extra money for me. The center of Dublin is either a quick (less than 20min) bus ride or a lovely walk down. I felt so well taken care of. Cant say enough how wonderful she is!
2965206,465773359,6/8/2019,"I would recommend Noeleen's place because she is a very special human being that make you feel at home. Also, she is pending about your needs and her place is very nice, sparkling and very homey!!"
2965206,473822876,6/22/2019,"I stayed at Noeleen's place for one week and can really recommend it! The ""little blue room"" is ""little"" indeed, but absolutely perfect for 1 person. There is a bathroom nearby for private use as well as a dining room. Everything is clean and tidy and a breakfast is provided every morning. Noeleen is such a kind person and has lots of tips on what to see and do (next time, I will definitely visit ""the happy pear"" ;-) The house is located on the north side of the Liffey, close to the famous Glasnevin Cemetery and the botanic garden. The city center lies within walking distance, but there are also several busses that stop right outside the house. It's a nice 15 min. walk along the canal to reach the train station. I really enjoyed my stay and will come back whenever I'll be back in Dublin."
2965206,478969393,6/30/2019,"Noeleen is amazing. Besides being incredibly helpful, she keeps a very organised and clean house. She is attentive to every detail to make our stay comfortable and memorable."
2965206,485172249,7/10/2019,"Just lovely!  Noeleen was kind and thoughtful, checking on me while I was battling jet lag. Her home ya comfortable, quiet and just as represented in photos.  Stay here, you wont regret it."
2965206,493890101,7/23/2019,Great communication and great hospitality
2965206,504179705,8/7/2019,Had a pleasant stay. The nearby cemetery and botanical gardens are well worth a visit.
2965206,527273573,9/10/2019,"Noeleen and her house are lovely! 
The little blue room is small, cute and stylish, containing everything you need. 
The blue wallpaper gives a lot of character and tranquillity to the environment. 
The house is gorgeous and one can say that Noeleen takes a lot of care in cleaning and arranging everything around. About the breakfast... it's very yummy and if you are lucky she will make an apple pie as the one I had, then you can watch the garden from the window and hope to see appearing her cat.
The place itself is in a wonderful location, near Glasnevin Cemetery and Dublin Botanic Gardens (go there!). You can walk slowly towards the city centre (20 min about) or get on a bus (10 min to O'Connell st). There are some little restaurants and take away nearby and a huge Tesco 10 min away. 
Yes, I would definitely suggest you this place."
2975343,420665436,3/7/2019,Nice house with all the necessary comforts to feel like at home. Highly recommended
2975343,448636914,5/5/2019,Nice and cosy house. Jon is a very nice host and you have to walk only 20 minutes to the city. You can buy some groceries near by.
2975343,455201446,5/19/2019,Die Kommunikation mit Jon war super. Er war sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich.
2975343,459429052,5/27/2019,Great place to stay at. Jon is very nice and helpful. Perfect location to travel around the city with bus stops near by

2975343,477011412,6/27/2019,"Nice homey place to relax and enjoy. Wonderful restaurants and pubs very close. Jon was very accommodating and welcoming, answering all our questions and issues very quickly. Would highly recommend."
2975343,484050193,7/8/2019,Jon is a fantastic host who was always available if something came up of importance regarding the house. The place was quaint and small but had a brilliant location with it only 5 minute walk from the dart!
2975343,499858146,8/1/2019,"Great value, excellent location if you are ok with nearby trainline and gym noise."
2975343,502995729,8/5/2019,"Jons place was what we needed for our stay - a place with lots of room and located in a fantastic area. Place could of used a more thorough cleaning, but was okay. The address on the ad doesnt seem to be where the house is actually located. We spent a good amount of time trying to find it and unfortunately missed our tour. Contact host before arriving for exact address."
2975343,551418149,10/20/2019,"Jon has a very nice and big house. We stayed with four people. There is a convenient kitchen with all kinds of cutlery. Jon had coffee, tea, milk, butter and bread for us. Bathroom is big, shower is hot and (big) towels are provided.  The house is located close to the docklands and within 30 minutes walking (a nice walk) you're on Grafton Street. Close to DART train stations. Jon's place is a good place to visit Dublin and nice quiet place for staying."
2975343,555923671,10/28/2019,Great place to stay. Very convenient to the RDS.
2985355,418945778,3/3/2019,"Easy communication, great hospitality and good location. Easy access to the train, taking you right into Dublin. Corina was a lovely host!"
2985355,421863052,3/10/2019,"Comfy room with a fabulous location just a few blocks from the train station. Very convenient. Also great proximity to Howth, a really beautiful, quaint fishing village turned local attraction."
2985355,430851447,3/31/2019,A lovely place for your trip + great comunication!! We were pleased. :)
2985355,437835936,4/15/2019,A really nice host! Thank you
2985355,449254186,5/6/2019,"Corina went above and beyond as a host! She was very friendly, and even helped us order a taxi to the airport and made a lovely warm breakfast. The room is clean, and the location is very close to both the city centre and Howth."
2985355,458592974,5/26/2019,Thank you so much for having us!
2985355,467511268,6/10/2019,Would highly recommend Corinas place! Great location and the friendliest host.
2985355,468742058,6/13/2019,"If you are looking for home away from home this is the place for you. Corina was fun to interact with and very knowledgeable about the area, what to see and how to get there. The room is perfect for young people traveling together."
2985355,471867170,6/18/2019,"We had a great stay, everything was clean and beautiful. Corina was very kind with us so we felt in home."
2985355,478658407,6/30/2019,Lovely polite host. Very helpful with directions into the city & even made us a sausage butty on arrival because we was starving. Located in a quiet area which is near the train station. Would stay again.
2985355,487597319,7/14/2019,"Corina was welcoming and offered information on the local area as well as traveling to and attractions in Dublin and Howth. The apartment was clean and cozy, and the breakfast we were served each morning was a nice way to start the day !"
2985355,489286091,7/16/2019,"Warm onthaal, heel vriendelijke gastvrouw, propere kamer. We hebben er van genoten!"
2985355,493306180,7/22/2019,"Corina is the kindness person on this planet. Sweet, loving, informative, and caring.  An excellent host. But her attic room is only god for 3 people. And No more. Otherwise excellent location for getting around."
2985355,512446470,8/18/2019,We stayed here for 1 night before flying out - Corina was quick to reply and very helpful. The space was spacious and perfect for what we needed. Thank you!
2985355,533892542,9/22/2019,Clean and calm accomodation.
2985355,555862067,10/28/2019,"Great communication, excellent hospitality, clean and tidy place to stay for a long weekend. Easy to get into Dublin either driving or catching the train. Great value and highly recommended."
3009793,469839152,6/15/2019,"Perfect location, you can easily access all of the local attractions in about a ten minute drive, some even walking distance! The space is ideal for solo travelers or a couple. Check-in was easy, they provided plenty of tips and resources for how to explore the area. 
Definitely a great deal!"
3009793,474558835,6/23/2019,"Everything OK.  Everybody who is able to read maps knows that the studio is not in the city center with restaurants, good shops, etc., but close to the tram stop."
3009793,533278704,9/21/2019,"The apartment is good for staying a few days in Dublin. Grainne provides a few maps and tips for every guest and made our arrival very easy, as she already gave us tips how to use the transport from the airport to the Airbnb. The apartment has everything you need. Supermarkets are nearby and the Luas to get to the city center is very close. We had a nice stay."
3012532,425852007,3/19/2019,"A great little place just on the fringe of Rush.  Easy access to the beach, great local pubs, near the airport and northern areas of Ireland."
3012532,447812768,5/4/2019,"Mary was a fantastic host. She was very friendly and accommodating and even let us use her baking pans from her own house. The home was a very nice space, fairly small but perfect for what we needed. The kitchen was fully stocked with plates, bowls, etc. and even tea and coffee. My friends and I had a very relaxing time lounging in the house and walking on the beach, which is right outside. The beach is very quiet (in early May) and has lots of lovely shells. There isnt a whole lot to do in Rush, but it was a very nice beach getaway."
3012532,474550618,6/23/2019,"Great location, right on the beach and a quick ten minute walk away from town and the pubs and restaurants there. The place is well equipped with everything you would need for a few days away and the hosts are very friendly."
3012532,476940418,6/27/2019,"Beautiful location, perfect facilities for families, highly recommended. Mary and Jason were perfect hosts"
3012532,480239339,7/2/2019,This is my second time staying at Mary & Jasons beach getaways and it was even better than the first time! Such a beautiful and cozy location. Mary is so accommodating and helpful! Thank you again! :)
3012532,483013780,7/7/2019,Great location on the beach.
3012532,513988531,8/20/2019,"Marys place is very clean, spacious, perfect for families but not only! You really are at the beach and Rush is very nice! You have pubs and restaurants nearby and Dublin is just approximately 40 min away, the airport is even nearer!
We will definitely come back! Thanks again for everything! :)"
3012532,519407441,8/28/2019,Lovely place and very attentive hosts.
3012532,544171189,10/9/2019,"We loved our stay. Mary was very quick with all the responses to our queries. The location was great. It was lovely to wake up to the sea view, hear and smell of the sea. The beach was literally on our door step and sandy and almost private during our time of travel.
Will definitely love to go back and stay there.
Thank you."
3012532,545973610,10/13/2019,A lovely location beside the beach but close enough to visit the city if wanted. Apartment has everything you need and beds comfortable.  I would stay there again for sure.
3012532,553995421,10/25/2019,"Mary & Jason were so helpful for the end of our visit to beautiful Ireland!  Our luggage was delivered much earlier than our reservation due to miscommunication on our part and they were so gracious to hold it for us.  Also, we didnt get a chance to grab coffee before we arrived and they shared theirs with us!  So friendly and accommodating. We would definitely go back.  Although it was a bit chilly I walked the beach and my husband went for a quick swim."
3012532,562101875,11/10/2019,"It was awesome at May and Jasons. The apartment is super nice! Next to the beach :) 
We would definitely come again. Thank you for that great weekend!"
3031518,465744450,6/8/2019,Good food and nice people!
3031518,466323956,6/9/2019,"This suite in the B and B was just right for my two close friends and me. The hosts met us right away and showed us our room and gave us some dinner suggestions. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We were in a nice neighborhood outside of Dublin central with some good dinning options which we walked to, about 15-20 mins."
3031518,470455244,6/16/2019,"Het verblijf bij Maeve en haar man is fantastisch! De kamers zijn perfect voor een City trip en het ontbijt is heerlijk. Tijdens het ontbijt kwamen Maeve en haar man geregeld gezellig een praatje maken en we hebben veel leuke aanbevelingen gekregen. Wat een lieve mensen! De ligging van de bed and breakfast is prima. Iets verder van de stad af, maar het centrum is goed bereikbaar met de bus. Wij hebben een erg leuk en goed verblijf gehad en willen deze bed and breakfast iedereen aanraden!"
3031518,482365816,7/6/2019,Lovely place and very friendly hosts.
3031518,483120212,7/7/2019,Meave's house was sparkling clean.  Lovely location.  Nice friendly helpful hosts.  Would definitely recommend.
3031518,497345429,7/28/2019,Maeve and her husband are so wonderful and welcoming. They helped us find where to buy LEAP cards (for public transit) and gave us some tips. I wish we could have stayed longer. This is an exceptional place to stay.
3031518,526014221,9/8/2019,I had a very good experience staying with Maeve and her husband! They were welcoming us warmly even though we arrived quite late in the evening. The breakfast is a real irish experience :) My parents will definitely stay here again when they visit my sister in Dublin!
3031518,529785244,9/15/2019,Maeve was extremely helpful and her house was very very well  situated for my needs.  The room was extremely clean and  Maeve's poached eggs were perfect. If I am honest I think it is a bit of a stretch to describe the room as a 'luxury cosy room' as it was  no more than a  perfectly pleasant bedroom: there was no ensuite and no where to sit apart form the bed because of the size of the room. I would definitely recommend it though.
3031518,535406273,9/24/2019,I made the reservation for my uncles and they really enjoyed the service and the service that Maeve and her husband provided to them.  They really enjoyed the house and its location.  They were very attentive and did their best.
3031518,537284226,9/28/2019,"Very clean and well kept home in a nice part of town if you want to stay outside of the hustle and bustle of the city, with a long seawall nearby for walks along the water with options for food and drink. Maeve was very hospitable where her custom breakfasts and room cleaning is a nice addition vs my other Airbnb experiences."
3031518,555187664,10/27/2019,"I had a wonderful time at Maeves place. She was kind, warm and friendly. She made us lovely breakfast in the morning. 
Her house was sparkling clean.
The only advice I would give is to check with Maeve in advance on how the heating works in the room. It can get chilly at night. 
Thank you Maeve for your wonderful hospitality."
3042183,457158619,5/23/2019,"Maeve's place is lovely. 
She is a wonderfully welcoming host who answered my questions promptly and was lovely to stay with. Lovely room, clean ensuite and delicious breakfast. A really good find for us, good location for what we needed. Nice area. We hope to be back. Maeve and her husband are great hosts. We had a great stay "
3042183,458048775,5/25/2019,Maeve and her husband were really friendly and hospitable. They told us how to get in the city centre and whats worth seeing. The accomodation has a shared bathroom and included breakfast. We enjoyed our stay at this charming house.
3042183,462723000,6/2/2019,"Shay & Meave great hosts. Friendly, warm & welcoming.. They both were very helpful giving directions etc. Their place was clean & Id recommend to anyone looking to stay in Clontarf. Thanks for lovely stay"
3042183,466399278,6/9/2019,Great place to relax outside of the city center. Near a beautiful park and some local food / pubs. Maeve was a very nice and attentive host.
3042183,473726388,6/22/2019,Maeves place was perfect for us as we had hired a car (Street parking was easy) and needed a few nights in Dublin to get settled after a few long flights from Australia. Breakfast in the morning was great and Maeves tips for what to see and experience in the city were great.
3042183,526007833,9/8/2019,"Very friendly hosts. Nice, quite and very clean room. Very rich breakfast. in general, a good experience!"

Highly recommended!!!"
3042183,533995972,9/22/2019,"Clean, comfortable and excellent host"
3042237,434114810,4/7/2019,nice clean room.  only there for a late evening sleepover before flying out.  highly suggest for overnight before flying out.
3042237,445495819,4/29/2019,"Maeve and her husband were so nice and welcoming! The Place was very nice and cozy, everything was clean all the Time and the area nearby was p erfect for a walk! The breakfast was delicious und Maeve had some very good tipps about places I could visit! The Bus station is just a couple minutes away! In addition to that the communication before my arrival was always on point and Maeve made sure to be contactable! 

I would definitely recommed staying with Maeve and her husband during your visit as they make you feel very comfortable and like you are visiting Family! :)"
3042237,459405194,5/27/2019,Maeve and Shay are super excellent. The breakfast provided is truly delicious and the bed is just comfy. I would recommend anyone stay at their place.

3042237,530074694,9/15/2019,"This was a great experience for me. Maeve was very accommodating and gave me tips on local restaurants, pubs, and places to see around the sea front. The room was very clean, had an electric kettle for tea and coffee, and fresh linens and towels. Breakfast was included and was delightful. Eggs, bacon, sausage, and black pudding as beans. I very much enjoyed my visit and plan to return."
3042237,534020644,9/22/2019,Maeve was very welcoming and the room and location was perfect. It's just a short walk to the sea front and a very nice restaurant for dinner. The breakfast was also great.
3042237,537878011,9/29/2019,"Lovely B&B in the heart of Clontarf. Very easy to get to, nice sizeable room and great hospitality. Excellent large cooked breakfast as well

I was recommended all the good local restaurants, cafes and bars, and was even lent an umbrella due to the bad weather.

Maeve and her husband couldnt have done any more, and in an expensive city, the stay was great value."
3055226,430947759,3/31/2019,"Great location, had all facilities needed. Would recommend"
3055226,438710484,4/17/2019,Enjoyed our time in this small cosy place. We didnt have a few things when we arrived but Tom was great at communicating and had those things resolved really quickly.
3055226,462484596,6/2/2019,"The location was even more amazing than expected - pretty much everything wanted to see or do was within walking distance. The area felt safe, the self-checkin was very easy, and Tom was very responsive when messaged. 

The house itself was even cooler than expected- the layout was really novel (in the best possible way), was roomie enough for a family of 3 + our family friends, and the wall art added a *really* nice touch to the atmosphere of the place."
3055226,557158242,10/31/2019,Tom's place was great! Look forward to returning
3055226,557548799,11/1/2019,Great places!
3056018,439625417,4/19/2019,Definitely recommend
3056018,458721797,5/26/2019,We had a great 2 night stay at Amanda's place. It was clean and comfortable and Amanda's family was very helpful. It's located a little out of the city but very easily accessible by public bus or taxi. There are also some nice shops and restaurants within walking distance to the house. Dublin was fantastic!
3056018,462750457,6/2/2019,"Ideal accommodation, Amanda was a great host, also allowed us check in rarly, very helpful "
3056018,471904718,6/18/2019,"This house was really great! We arrived during a rain storm, and Amanda's husband greeted us and got us all sorted out. There is a very nice street to park on behind the flat, and it made it really easy for us to come and go at our leisure. The home is also very close to the bus stop, so getting into Dublin was very easy.
We had plenty of room for our family of six. Everyone got great sleep on the comfy beds! Amanda, the host, was very sweet and checked in on us from time to time to make sure we had everything we needed. We felt very welcome, and really enjoyed our visit. The next time we are in Dublin, this is where we'll stay!"
3056018,484208749,7/8/2019,"Very modern, clean apartment. Host left us bagels, butter, tea and milk; so thoughtful and much appreciated. Easy to get into town on the bus; remember they take coins only. Amanda and her husband were wonderful hosts!!"
3056018,490345922,7/18/2019,"This is a great place to stay for a visit to Dublin. It is close to the bus route which goes directly into OConnell Street. Local shops are within easy walking distance for groceries. The apartment itself is behind the owners house, accessed through a back gate, behind which guests can park their car.  It is clean and has modern decor and a well equipped kitchen."
3056018,495581913,7/26/2019,Amanda has been an unbelievable host and has really went out of her way to accommodate us.  It has been a real home from home and will return again very soon!

3056018,529221188,9/14/2019,"Very close to Dublin city. It was a little difficult to find, since we were unable to call the host, since we did not have Wi-Fi or cell service. But once we got there, the stay was terrific. Easy to drive to Dublin!
Safe town to stay in, close by the grocery store. Bus access as well!"
3056018,542218555,10/6/2019,Great place 
3056018,546197982,10/13/2019,"Great place, about ‚Ç¨15 in a taxi to the city and the same to the airport. Amanda and her husband were around to welcome us and help us with directions to the local village and Dublin. Thanks again!"
3056018,555981248,10/28/2019,"Thanks for having us in Finglas, 5 people fit in this flat well and it was very clean and modern. There were some issues with hot water on a timer which were sorted by the host. If you dont have a car there are taxis running and a bus (we didnt try the bus) into Dublin. Tea and coffee kindly provided. Thanks!"
3088332,484219590,7/8/2019,Jack is a great host and is very pleasant. The bed was comfy and had a window that opened nice and wide for the warm breeze. Great central location. Cheers Jack! X

3093370,500450721,8/2/2019,"Geraldine is helpful and extremely friendly in every possible way. She even picked us up and dropped us off at the airport . She spent a lot of time answering questions. She made us feel like visiting a relative. 

This is a beautiful Victorian house that has been lovingly restored. The bedroom was clean and extremely comfortable. There is a direct bus route to the city. Would love to come back sometime."
3093370,507132637,8/11/2019,"Great place to stay! Geraldine and her husband are very nice, and the residential environment is quiet, and you need about 40 minutes to go to the city centre with public transports."
3093370,510592951,8/16/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay in Geraldines beautiful Victoria-style home. Geraldine was a fantastic host all throughout our stay. She graciously allowed us to check in many hours prior to check-in with little notice on our part (which we apologized for and for which she was very understanding). Our room was spacious, clean, homey, and the bed was very comfortable. Geraldine laid out for us a wonderful breakfast spread each morning and was often there to keep us company in the mornings, which was lovely. Geraldine, being a local, also had many excellent recommendations for what to see while in Ireland and really eased our way around the city by providing us with directions and instructions and even allowing us to use one of the reloadable bus cards that she had available for guest use. Bathrooms were always clean and readily available for our use. Absolutely no complaints about our stay. It was everything we had wanted and more. Will definitely stay again on our next venture to Dublin."
3093370,513317032,8/19/2019,"Geraldine was such an amazing host. Her place was perfect for our stay. It was a short walk and about a 15 min bus ride into town. She also gave us some info on things to do/places to go. Would highly recommend staying here. Bed was super comfortable, very quiet and relaxing environment."
3093370,517090226,8/25/2019,"I haven't seen such a beautiful house till date. 
1) Cleanliness - Top notch

3) Ammenties - Bountiful
4) For us guys it was "" A home away from home"".

Thanks Geraldine"
3096382,425894539,3/19/2019,Sean is a wonderful host. He allowed us to check in a bit early. He was there to greet us when we arrived from the airport.  He spent a good amount of time showing us around the apartment and shared many ideas/suggestions of places to go and things to do.
3096382,434047679,4/7/2019,"Sean is a wonderful host! His home is in a perfect location, the terrace is great, and the beds are very comfortable. He also gave us a bunch of suggestions on things to do in Dublin and accommodated our late check-out!"
3096382,441864343,4/22/2019,"We had a lovely time in Dublin at Sean's, the apartment is perfect for a long weekend in this great city. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace with his view over the temple bar district. 
The location of the apartment is great, we reached everything by foot. 
It's in the middle of temple bar, that's why it's quite noisy at nights. We hadn't had any problems with it, but if you're a light sleeper, earplugs would be useful."
3096382,448540935,5/5/2019,"It was just great!
The location is in the heart of Temple Bar and you can reach everything per foot. On rooftop terrace you can spend some cozy hours with a view over Temple Bar and the beds are very comfortable.
On the Check-In Sean gave us very usefull tips, for some spots we can visit. Sean also answered within minutes everytime when we chatted.
We had a very good time in this apartment.
If i come again, i definitly choose this apartement again!"
3096382,451820277,5/12/2019,Great central flat.
3096382,454492871,5/18/2019,"We absolutely loved our stay at Seans apartment. Sean is an excellent host and very very knowledgeable about the area and full of recommendations and local charm.
Perfectly clean and tidy apartment with lots of extra towels and even adapters for foreign electrical equipment. The location simply cannot be better. It was amazing to be so close to everything. Literally just step outside, and youre in the middle of the buzzing street life of the most lively area in all of Dublin with pubs, food and live music."
3096382,458041742,5/25/2019,"Sean, is an awsome host, he welcomed us personally, showed us around and gave us some great tipps. The apartment is in the middle of temple bar district and I was suprised... it wasn¬¥t as loud as expected (closed window). The terrace is big and has a great few. We loved to have our morning coffee there. The apartment is nice, very clean and has everthing you need. Both beds are very comfortable. I highly recommend Sean¬¥s apartment and would love to stay there again."
3096382,468382523,6/12/2019,"Seans place is fantastic and full of character. I especially loved the location in Temple Bar it was very convenient for me as I was visiting a lot of friends and family in Dublin. Communication with Sean is really good, I got very quick responses to any questions I had for him.  I would definitely stay with Sean again he is fantastic and very reliable. I love the roof terrace and garden a great place to chill out."
3096382,471868321,6/18/2019,"Perched high above the bustling streets of Temple Bar, Seans place is the perfect spot to in one moment, put your feet up and relax, and in another, be immersed right into the heart of the pubs, live music and liveliness that Temple Bar has to offer! The apartment is chock full of interesting art and wonderful books, which we enjoyed perusing. It is also centrally located, which made it very easy to walk around to most all of the attractions in Dublin. Sean was a wonderful host, and communication with him was five star from first to last. There are a lot of stairs to get up to the apartment, so if you have any mobility issues, thatd be a downside. Otherwise, a great place to stay!"
3096382,478842865,6/30/2019,"A great central location and Sean is a friendly and knowledgeable host. Travellers here should be aware this is noisy at night being in the main bar and club area of Dublin. The apartment has space for 2 couples but one of the bedrooms is also the main living room. The roof terrace is a very useful extra area if the weather is good. The kitchen is small but has the necessary amenities and there are local shops for groceries.
The apartment is overall comfortable and spacious and we would recommend it as a good location to easily explore Dublin."
3096382,484038443,7/8/2019,Seans place is in a fantastic location to take advantage of all the great sights and enjoyment that Dublin has to offer . Great roof terrace also to relax and unwind at the end of the day.
3096382,485103063,7/10/2019,"This apartment is in a great, central location.  Everything you need is within a short walk.  The rooms are clean and the rooftop is a great perk, we ate dinner outside both nights.  Because of it's central location, it can sometimes be noisy at night. Sean is a great host, very warm and helpful. We would definitely come again!"
3096382,489274328,7/16/2019,"It was super lovely, Sean is a great host, location is perfect so as long as you dont care about noise from bars (and enjoy it instead) you will have a great time here!! Terrace is great as well :)"
3096382,492498083,7/21/2019,Sean was a Terrific host and apartment is in perfect location - walk to everything.  Only way to see Dublin!  Had a car one day in Dublin - worthless!  Important to be able to walk to everything - and we did!  Saved the car for the several nights on the wild Atlantic way - which was great contrast with Dublin.....
3096382,498082563,7/29/2019,Centrally located in the heart of Temple Bar. Easy access to many great restaurants and bars. Rooftop patio provides an escape from the hustle and bustle of the streets below while still allowing you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the area.
3096382,513951679,8/20/2019,"The best place in Dublin, no better more central location for the city.  Seans place is super clean, check in was with him personally and he wants you to enjoy his city.  Comfortable beds and plenty of towels and hot water makes this an outstanding location and apartment to enjoy the capital city of Ireland."
3096382,521050840,8/31/2019,Great place. It is clean and very centrally located. Sean is an excellent host. I would recommend this place to anyone.
3096382,525172306,9/7/2019,"It was our first time in Dublin and we loved it. Let me start by first saying that Sean himself was fantastic. He personally greeted us which was such a nice touch and he was very accommodating and helpful to our needs. The place was great - exactly what we were looking for - spacious, comfortable, and walking distance to everything! It was especially great having a washer/dryer in the apartment. The rooftop deck was lovely. Everything was great and we would definitely stay here again! (Only note is that since it is in the Temple Bar area, it can get a bit noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper like me, ear plugs and/or a sound machine or white noise being played on your phone is a huge help)"
3096382,529056206,9/14/2019,"Seans apartment is clean, spacious and in a great location. Its in walking distance to all the great pubs and attractions nearby. Sean went above and beyond to accommodate our early flight arrival. He also responds right away with any questions you might have . I highly recommend staying here if traveling to Dublin!"
3096382,534167487,9/22/2019,"Sean is a great host. The location is amazing and the rooftop is super unique. Just a word of warning, it is loud outside until late (like 5am). Not a complaint (some of the music is great), just be aware. Also, there are 3 flights of stairs. So if anyone in your party is mobilizing challenged, not the best choice. Overall though, I would highly recommend."
3096382,536304581,9/26/2019,Sean was a fantastic host. When we met with him he gave us a ton of insite about the area and suggested all sorts of great places to visit and eat at. Top notch host!! I just wish that the bar across the street wasnt so darn loud!! We had to sleep with ear buds in in order to fall asleep.
3096382,538830287,9/30/2019,"If you want to be in the middle of night life, this is perfect. Weve loved to be around all the pubs and walking distance to the citys point of interest. Sean gave us a warm welcome and good advices that we appreciated. Weak spot: the flat is a bit small for 5. The kitchen equipment is really minimalist, not even a wine glass per person."
3096382,544136948,10/9/2019,"This is a good place to stay if you're looking to be somewhere fun.  The flat is functional but not fancy, and the roof deck is a nice perk.  I'd say it's a better place for backpackers than for families, given that the building is in the middle of a busy bar street. Sean was very nice and communication was good.  Just 2 things everyone should know:  1.)  It's a walk-up of about 4 small flights of stairs, so it might be tough on those with limited mobility.  2.)  It gets loud, especially on weekends, and sometimes until 2 or 3am. So either bring earplugs or stay out drinking until then.
Overall, my friend and I enjoyed the place and would stay there again, but it's probably not a place where I'd stay with my young family."
3096382,548253539,10/17/2019,"This rental offers the perfect location for anyone visiting Dublin, especially for the first time.  The vibrant Temple Bar location is perfect for dining, sight seeing, pub hopping or just wandering on foot.  Its easy to get to and Sean was there to meet me even though I arrived early.  He was readily available during my stay but fortunately not needed."
3096382,558024107,11/2/2019,"We had a wonderful stay at Seans place. We were central to the city and an easy walk to the bus for day trips out of the city. Sean was an incredible host and got back to us right away with any questions. He also gave us wonderful recommendations. It is in the bar district, so it can be loud at nights, but we were fine with earplugs. Beds very comfortable and just a great place!"
3109535,418087884,3/1/2019,Emma was very helpful and she runs a clean household. Very comfortable bed with a clean bathroom. Wonderful stay! 
3109535,423162639,3/13/2019,It was the perfect place for my trip. It's very conveniently located to public transport and the room is cozy and quiet! I would definitely recommend staying here.
3109535,428961308,3/26/2019,"Emma's place is exactly how it is in the pictures. Very clean. The part that I liked is that it is very very near a  bus stop and Dublin has a great bus service so the city centre is never that far away. Its also right next to a lovely canal and its a nice walk along the canal.
And its quiet outside. The occasional car going past.
The house is quiet and the dog is a darling. Very friendly."
3109535,433383228,4/6/2019,"Emma's place is comfy & cozy. Well kept & perfect for your traveling needs.  It is easy access to public transportation & local attractions.

3109535,436595664,4/13/2019,Emma's place was clean and had all necessities. Her daughter was helpful and her dog was friendly. Emma was clear with instructions and patiently explained to me the directions when i got lost and confused. It was a pleasant stay.
3109535,437796370,4/15/2019,"Emmas place was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. She responded quickly to questions and was flexible with our check-in time. She gave us our space once we arrived but was a kind host and we enjoyed our stay."
3109535,438735364,4/17/2019,"Our stay at Emma was very nice. We were welcomed very friendly and felt comfortable. The room and private bathroom were well furnished. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bus stop was one minute away, so you are very quickly in the center."

3109535,441946375,4/22/2019,"We had a great stay in Emma's apartment. Before and during the stay she is always available and answer you very fast. 
The room is the same that you can see on the pictures.
The apartment is not located in the city center but it is very well communicated with tram and bus (it takes around 15 minutes to reach the center), furthermore the neighbourhood is very calm!"
3109535,445992013,4/30/2019,"Emmas place is in a great situation, a short cab ride from anywhere. You enter with a code to the building which is temperamental but hopefully will be fixed soon. We came in late both nights and had to call Emma to let us in."

3109535,457487086,5/24/2019,Absolutely fantastic place. Great location where you can get a more local side to Dublin that the downtown touristy area. Very comfortable apartment and the sweetest dog. Would recommend
3109535,460441594,5/29/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin. Only a few minutes away from the closest tram station. The bus station is right in front of the appartment. Emma was a great host.
3109535,462816294,6/2/2019,"Pictures and description as in the air bnb profile.
Everything super clean!
Super cute small dog Jackson, who also welcomed us with Emma.
You have a bedroom and a small bathroom for yourself, Emma also offered to use the kitchen for coffee/tea but we didn't need it.
Walking distance to the eg temple bar 35 minutes, taxi around 15 Euro, bus 3 Euro.
We definitely had a nice stay at Emma's apartment in Dublin and can recommend."
3109535,466405813,6/9/2019,"Emmas place in Dublin was great for our short stay. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and having an en suite bathroom was a nice plus. The blackout curtains definitely helped us in the morning after a late night out at the Dublin pubs. We lucked out with the weather and ended up walking to Jameson one afternoon, which took us about 30 minutes. The area is clean and safe. We would recommend staying here."
3109535,468434500,6/12/2019,"Emma's place was easy to find with her instructions and close to the Luas station. The room was nice and clean with a jug of water available in the room. I was able to come and go on my schedule. It was also easy to get the tram to Heuston for the transfer to the airport (good to board at the first stop as the bus gets crowded!) Overall, a great place to stay!"
3109535,469326978,6/14/2019,"Emma is a terrific host, very friendly and helpful. She communicated clearly and quickly, and she ensured the room was spotless upon our arrival despite a quick turnaround between guests. She also gave us great tips for local pubs and restaurants."

3109535,476081562,6/25/2019,"I would highly recommend Emmas place! Emma is a great host and she helped us out with figuring out how to get the visitor Leap cards. It is easy to get anywhere from her place!
Meeting Jackson the dog was also really fun! He is super cute!
I highly recommend Emmas place!"
3109535,489281436,7/16/2019,"Not great, I don't recommend it..."
3109535,491442758,7/20/2019,"Emmas place was easily accessible from public transportation, making getting around Dublin a breeze. The neighborhood features a couple of sweet little bakeries. Biggest downside is that it is situated on a busy road with lots of traffic noise, even through the night."
3109535,497064539,7/28/2019,"My friend and I justed needed a place to crash for one night and Emma's place was great for that - clean, comfortable and the ensuite made it feel private. Location is great too, short drive away from some very nice restaurants and pubs. We didn't really hear the noise mentioned in a few other reviews, we had a really good sleep. The only thing was we weren't too sure where the breakfast was (it is self-serve) as I didn't get a chace to meet/talk to Emma because of our late arrival but that could have easily been rectified had I contacted Emma (she is quick to respond), however we were rushing off so just skipped brekkie. Thanks Emma for a lovely stay :)"
3109535,498841676,7/30/2019,Great communication and easy check in/out. Very nice room.
3109535,504252721,8/7/2019,Emma was so hospitable and was flexible for our situation. Her dog Jackson is a sweet soul. This BnB is just a quick tram ride to everything downtown Dublin. She was our first experience of Ireland and it was a pleasant experience. -Kolt & Kels
3109535,505541415,8/9/2019,"Emma was a great host who gave detailed instructions on how to get in and around her space and neighbourhood.  We didn't get to spend much time with her, but had some nice playtime with her gorgeous dog.  Emma's place is in a great spot that is  close to all the things you'd like to see in Dublin.  It's particularly near the Kilmainham Gaol which, as we found out, is a very popular attraction.  Grab tickets for it early.  It's only a short walk away from Emma's so it's easy to take advantage of... if you can get in."
3109535,514037631,8/20/2019,"Perfect room for staying some days in Dublin,  near to tram and with bus connections to the center. Clean bedroom and bath with all you need. Shared Living area with integrated kitchen was very homely and spacious. Although Emma was abroad while we stayed at Dublin, she took care of us and made sure everything was fine, e.g. provided stocks for a simple breakfast."

3109535,534962440,9/23/2019,"Emma is very responsive and provided lots of good tips for the area. The place was very clean and tidy. The parking is limited at the building but there is street parking nearby. Some sound such as conversation and music can come through the walls at times, but not at any absurd hour."
3109535,538105783,9/29/2019,"Emma was friendly, and it was nice to have the en-suite. Parking is very difficult to find."
3109535,538787696,9/30/2019,A great location for those using public transport.

Emma made sure we were able to check in easily and left us to our own devices. The room was comfortable and clean, overall a great place to explore from."
3109535,553554099,10/24/2019,"The place is awesome and Emma is fantastic. Detailled instructions made it all so easy and she makes one feels at home. One of the best hosts weve ever stayed at, for sure!"

3109535,558584736,11/3/2019,"We had an amazing time at Emmas place. She gave us detailed instructions on how to arrived and was waiting for us.

3109535,566013502,11/18/2019,"This apartment is exactly as described, and is very clean, comfortable, and well located. I could walk from it to some of the places I wanted to visit, and bus and tram stops are just a few minutes away. The neighborhood feels safe, and I was glad I chose to stay there. Emma is a great host, very interesting to talk with, and communication with her was good. Her daughter was helpful to me too on the night I arrived. So I recommend Emma's apartment to anyone visiting Dublin who wants a clean room with a private bath, and a considerate host."

3137058,447794443,5/4/2019,"Peter was a super friendly and very helpful host, and overall we really enjoyed staying with him. His home was easy enough to reach by bus from the airport, it was sparkling clean and just a quick bus ride into the city centre. The only thing we didn't appreciate was the additional sexually explicit and religious art in our bedroom which weren't shown on the photos. Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend Peter to others looking for a place to stay in Dublin."
3137058,450022900,5/8/2019,Peter gave us a really warm welcome and good advices for our stay. His place was lovely and cosy and we enjoyed our time.

3137058,453607801,5/16/2019,"We staid 2 nights at Peter's place, and we couldn't have asked for more from our stay.

We also took advantage of some great local tips and recommendations from Peter."
3137058,464339888,6/5/2019,"Stylish space, clean warm and friendly. Lovely spacious room, great on street free parking. 10 minute walk to the luas. Peter is a brilliant host full of local tips and great for directions."

3137058,513922702,8/20/2019,"Peter's home is absolutely lovely - it's more than a home, it's his own passion project. The bathroom is gorgeous, the shower is amazing and the bedroom is spacious yet cosy. Everything was well-kept and super clean. 
Peter himself is a very kind and enthousiastic host and we had a great time staying with him. He also gave us some great pointers for places to have breakfast and things to visit, advice we took him up on and didn't regret at all. 
The neighbourhood is quiet, about half an hour's walk from the city centre, but there's a bus stop around the corner where buses pass very frequently. We definitely recommend staying with Peter!"
3137058,515618635,8/23/2019,"Peter is the best airbnb host ever! He welcomed me at home and I really enjoyed chatting with him. 

This is the kind of airbnb experience I always expected but never really got, you travel to a new place and you stay with a nice person who shares his home and as well as his life story with you. You get to live in a wonderful place that shows the hosts personality and thoughts, and from those chats you also get some new perspectives. You are not just staying in an apartment you are also making a new friend.

My holiday in Dublin got so much more special and memorable because of it.

(I also want to add that this house has the cleanest bathroom Ive ever seen in my whole life...)"
3137058,517433100,8/25/2019,"Thank you Peter for a lovely stay. We really enjoyed our time in your Airbnb. We loved the stylish decor, comfortable bed and good location.

3137058,526774354,9/9/2019,"Peters place is wonderful, we would rate it 5+ stars really easily. Common area was really clean, the bedroom was warm and we had a comfortable bed. There was no noise in the neighborhood, so no problems to sleep. 
His spot is around 20 minutes walking from downtown, so most things we planned to visit we achieved without public transportation even though there are bus stops close to his place. 

As host Peter is really lovely. He shared detailed informations on how to arrive to his house, so it was really easy to find it from the airport. He also recommended nice restaurants which were really great. 

We would definitely recommend Peters accommodations."
3137058,545357989,10/12/2019,"5 stars everything. Easy access to the city centre using public transportation. The place is just lovely, very clean, quiet and you can notice Peters effort to make you feel that your home, this made our trip a hundred times better :)"
3137058,546994976,10/14/2019,"The house is very charming, spacious double room, the place is clean and near to the city center (just a few bus stops). Peter was very communicative and welcoming, he suggested us good places to enjoy Dublin. We ll surely be back :)"
3137058,557172783,10/31/2019,"My stay at Peter's home was so much better than I could have hoped for. I came to Peter's house after having moved to Dublin by myself, and he made sure I felt welcome and at home. 

Peter is a fabulous host. He is warm and friendly, sociable but never overly so. He treated me like I belonged there and went above and beyond to ensure my safety and comfort. The house is always clean, within walking distance to all amenities and the city centre, and the room is bright and comfortable. I highly recommend the place for both single people and couples. I will miss his generous tea selection and our chats!"
3137058,562813884,11/11/2019,"One of the most wonderful experiences that myself and Safiya have ever had, never been more welcomed and looked after! The house itself is incredible and really does possess the cleanest bathroom in the world! We will be coming back to Ireland hopefully many more times and will definitely be staying here every time. If its your first time in Dublin and you love art and food, Peter has so many amazing recommendations!"
3137058,565959233,11/18/2019,Great place!!
3143338,467998831,6/11/2019,Brian was very nice and helpful without bering intrusive. The Apartment was perfect for three people and very well located.
3143338,470577766,6/16/2019,"Great location, very close to Dundrum Luas station, great flexibility (we got there earlier than the checkin time and everything was ready) and there's also parking space for those renting a car. Thank you, Brian!"
3143338,475998443,6/25/2019,Brian's place is a lovely 2 bedroom flat. The bedrooms are roomy and the hardwood floors in the hall and front bedroom are a great touch. The beds are super comfortable.

For sure we will come back there for the next travel to Dublin!!"
3143338,488707879,7/15/2019,Brians apartment is very close to the Luas Station and also to the Dumdrum Town Center. It is definitely a very good option if you have to visit Dublin for a short time or also for longer periods. Things to improve: the kitchen is too basic and there are no dishwasher.
3143338,492316084,7/21/2019,"A quiet neighborhood in Dundrum is the start to your cozy home setting in south Dublin..Brian's home is warm and comfortable;private and perfectly located for super access to the local ""LUAS"" service to the city center...Everything you need is no more than five minutes away from your rose laced private entrance...Can't wait to return!"
3143338,502092920,8/4/2019,A lovely annex at Brians house. Very convenient to go to the stores in Dundrum and very close to get the Green Line Metro to Dublin (15 min). Brian is welcoming and gives all the information about his location on arrival
3143338,508799328,8/13/2019,"Good place really close to all you need (luas, supermarket, etc.). Quiet place with some parks and playgrounds around. Brian was very helpful."
3187009,421824121,3/10/2019,We had a great time in Dublin and staying at Linas apartment was perfect for us. Everything was just how described and getting to the city centre was easy and uncomplicated.
3187009,426239904,3/20/2019,"Lina was very accommodating after a mixup with the booking schedule, so this was not the original listing that I had intended to purchase, but ended up being the place that we stayed during our visit to Dublin.  Lina was always extremely respectful and responsive, and the place appears as described in the posting. Realistically, though, travel time to the city falls more around 30+ minutes by one public bus. There was also a burst pipeline in the neighborhood during our stay which rendered the shower unusable, which was unfortunate for our three night stay. Of course, this was outside of Lina's control and she was willing to provide a small refund for the inconvenience.   It is also worth noting that it is possible to hear the guests staying in the room adjacent to this one through the wall, but it wasn't a problem for us.  I would recommend this place to young travelers who are looking for somewhere cheap to stay for just a few nights and don't mind a small space (there was only two of us and it was fairly cramped) with some travel time to the city."
3187009,430915471,3/31/2019,Muy a gusto
3187009,445423101,4/29/2019,"Linas place dies exactly what it says , I was a bit rushed so I didnt really get time to enjoy my stay, I got what I needed during my stay , woukd if liked sugar for the coffee, but everything did what I needed for my quick stay .. but a lot of stuff in the small, room could do with less furniture in room .."
3187009,451171670,5/11/2019,Good location just outside of Dublin city. It is a bit small so it was perfect for my friends and I who are college students and wanted an affordable place to stay.
3187009,456287897,5/21/2019,The accomodation was good and fast to reach and the information from Lina very good!!
3187009,461393509,5/31/2019,Lina was a really nice host who gave us some good tips on how to get there etc. We had a really nice stay! The flat is quite small but we stayed for 5 days and it was totally fine! Also the small kitchen was really nice to have some breakfast in the morning etc. All in all we had a really nice stay.
3187009,467397765,6/10/2019,"Place was nice. A little small for 4 people but we made it work. The location is much farther than a 10 minutes ride though. We took the bus everyday and its take at least 30 mins to get to the city. Location is safe, though, just not quite as advertised."
3187009,471951363,6/18/2019,"Don't even think about it. At any price, you are so far away from making connections or anything you would like to do, you will be happier paying more anywhere else."
3187009,476025983,6/25/2019,"We stayed four nights in Linas studio apartment and were a group of four people. Its small but definitely alright for a couple of days. 
The apartment is located a bit outside Dublin city center but its super easy to get on a bus or a train even in the evening. 
You can walk to the grocery store in about 20 minutes. 
We definitely recommend the studio apartment and would come back!"
3187009,487577382,7/14/2019,"Cosy room with all the amenities youd need! Was clean and linas Communication and instructions were great! 

Room is about 30 or so minutes out from the city but the bus stop is basically at the front of the house which was super handy! (Although keep in mind buses do stop running at about midnight.)"
3187009,500007400,8/1/2019,"The place was nice and had everything we needed. It is very small, so maybe for 4 people isn't quite ideal. Lina was very responsive and gave us tips for buses and grocery stores nearby. However, the place was quite far from city centre. It took us 40-45 mins by bus. The buses (and trains) are not that frequent and sometimes it will drop you off on a farther stop from the house. The closest grocery stores was 20-25mins walk. Overall, we enjoyed our time."
3187009,502230821,8/4/2019,We left the space after 5 minutes inside.
3188621,421337718,3/9/2019,"Cosy apartment, good proximity to everything you would need. Lina is a very friendly and accommodating host."
3188621,423150838,3/13/2019,Thank you for letting us stay in your home. It was a great location within walking distance of main attractions. Lina was very communicative from the start and let us drop luggage off early. Becky x
3188621,426197094,3/20/2019,"Our stay with Lina was amazing! She was incredible at communication, with fast responses and such kindness, she made our stay easy and efficient. The location is great if you want to be close enough to walk to places on Dame Street, but far enough outside of the action where you can just grab a drink at a local pub.

Would definitely stay again, and highly recommend her space to anyone else looking to travel to Dublin for a week and who doesnt plan to be in the apartment except to sleep!"
3188621,427261703,3/23/2019,"Great host. Great communication prior to arrival. The room is small,two bunk beds that are comfy, and the room is clean.

Thirty second walk from the bus to the centre of Dublin which is only about ten minutes away on the bus so really easy access to all of Dublins attractions. 

Definitely recommend!"
3188621,429232124,3/27/2019,Good location close to city highlights.
3188621,434733368,4/8/2019,"Just to sleep, perfect !"
3188621,446872202,5/2/2019,Linas apartment is as close as you can get to the Guinness Factory and is within walking distance of most of the rest of the attractions. The room is a bit cramped for more than two people but this apartment is great if you only need it to sleep!
3188621,452906791,5/14/2019,Great location!
3188621,455911622,5/20/2019,"Great location and value for the price. Lina was easy to communicate, nice and kind."
3188621,460527726,5/29/2019,Overall great place to stay! Didnt realize we were sharing the space but it worked out completely fine. Location is great if you dont mind walking into the city center.
3188621,463465560,6/3/2019,Perfect location!
3188621,465712996,6/8/2019,"As other reviews mention, it is small, but we only needed a place to sleep. Great proximity to Guinness store house and great little pub on the corner just down the street. A little bit of a hike from the metro, but doable. Local taxi (NRC) had terrible reviews, but Lina suggested them and they showed up right on time for our morning departure."
3188621,478015446,6/29/2019,"Linas apartment is clean and cozy. If youre looking to stay somewhere thats not directly in the hustle and bustle of the city centre this is the place to be. Its a great neighbourhood with a small local bar at the end of the street. From the apartment it is approximately a 20-25 minute walk to the Temple Bar area, there is  regular buses running which also adds to convenience. If youre wanting to visit the Guinness Storehouse or catch the DoDublin hop on hop off bus its only a short walk away. 

Overall a highly recommend apartment to book. Thanks for your help Lina "
3188621,481229738,7/4/2019,Small but a great location with plenty of amenities and a kind host. Thank you for the stay!
3188621,487859738,7/14/2019,Great stay in Dublin near city center with my two sons. Lina was a great host and there were no surprises. She very accurately detailed the description of the apartment and was very responsive with communication.
3188621,491602303,7/20/2019,"Lina was a lovely host, friendly without being obtrusive, responsive and prompt in her communications, and warm.  Her place is well located, clean and comfortable.  Lina provides some nice extras such as slippers, a fan, and cups, kettle and tea or coffee making provisions.  Although the room can accommodate 4 individuals, it is a quite small space and so was a bit cramped for 3 adults plus luggage. However, it served our needs fine, as we were primarily looking for a place to sleep. A nice place to use to explore Dublin!"
3188621,503740861,8/6/2019,"The space has everything you need, however is a little tight for more than 2 people, host is very kind and helpful"
3188621,513957371,8/20/2019,Visited Dublin with two friends for a few days. Lina made some good recommendations and communication was very easy. Apartment is in walking distance of the most popular streets (the bus station would be right next to it). I would book the same room again:)
3188621,515646631,8/23/2019,"Good location, only a 10min walk to temple bar, 1min walk to the Guinness factory. Lina was very nice, welcoming and friendly, we only seen her  when we checked in, didnt hear or see her for the 2 nights we stopped there. The apartment was very small, there was only 2 of us and it was cramped. It was clean and tidy but the 2 bunk beds take up the whole room. I would stop here again, good value and nice host"
3188621,518339091,8/26/2019,Absolutely the best location! Shes great! Had a great time.
3188621,530875553,9/16/2019,Clean and tiny room. Very nice and responsive hostess.
3188621,532705050,9/20/2019,"Great little room for people who don't spend much time in it. Has great little local bars around that I would recommend. Downtown is actually 15-20 minutes walk away. It's alright in the morning, but a little rough late at night when you've been walking all day!"
3188621,534843972,9/23/2019,"Well situated accomodation. 
Small and cosy. 
Lina was very helpful and responded rapidly when I had difficulties finding the entrance late at night."
3188621,537999121,9/29/2019,Great! Good hints like getting the visitor leap card at dublin airport
3188621,542266789,10/6/2019,"Location was great; it was within walking distance of many of the famous sights. Room was a little tight, but perfect for what my friends and I had planned for Dublin."
3188621,547973578,10/16/2019,Nice place to stay  and get some rest. In very convenient location with quick access to the centre (walking distance).
3188621,559544910,11/4/2019,"Small room but perfectly clean and great place close from everywhere, you can do everything by walk.
If you looking for a place to use only for sleep and be close from the city it's really a good price!"
3188621,561344039,11/9/2019,"This place is good if you are only looking for a place to sleep and shower. Aside from that the space is a bedroom in the host's apartment (which is cold 90% of the time), it is not very functional as there is a lot put into it to be accommodating but lacks the aspect of accessibility. The bathroom facilities are also very small and shared with the host. However, it is kept very clean and the host is very friendly and accessable."
3238040,419092135,3/3/2019,"Really clean and cosy room!  The bed was very comfortable and its bright with a big window. Rodrigo is great at communicating with you and always responds quickly. 

The area is nice and very good for the airport coach or a short cab into central Dublin"
3238040,421916237,3/10/2019,Very nyce 
3238040,424719861,3/17/2019,Great little place about a mile and a half outside the city center. In a great neighborhood. Definitely small but perfect if you dont plan on staying in the room much.
3238040,428556068,3/25/2019,"Great location for those looking to be close enough to all the action but far enough to have peace and quiet. The bus route to/from the airport was very convenient. The LUAS was a great form of transportation to get where you wanted to go (quick and fast). The neighbor is very peaceful and save at night. We would get back to the Airbnb late night and had no issues walking from the LUAS. I would advise to check the times the LUAS stop operating as its different from week to weekend. If doing the Guinness or Jameson tours, I recommend you go early as possible to avoid the crowds. That way you have the rest of the day to enjoy. Much thanks to Rodrigo for allowing us to stay! Highly recommended."
3238040,429549877,3/28/2019,Small but quiet with bed and a good shower. I wouldnt want to cook anything here.
3238040,434065410,4/7/2019,"Rodrigos place was a fantastic launch point for all of our activities in Dublin. We were walking distance to virtually everything we were hoping to see and do! Rodrigo was quick to respond to any questions or accommodations and the check in process was seamless. We would definitely stay here again. 10 min walk to a fun pub called the Barge, live music, good food, friendly staff. Cheers!"
3238040,436043079,4/12/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin
3238040,437148907,4/14/2019,"Great apartment in picturesque Ranelagh district in south Dublin. Comfy for a shorter stay discovering a fantastic city.

Convenient for the city centre and all the wonders it has to offer, as well as lesser known gems on the doorstop. Also very convenient for the airport on the Aircoach - 700 route.

Local restaurants were brilliant. A trip to Dublin should not be without a sitting at Clanbrassil House ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) and The Winding Stair ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) Both top notch!

Rodrigo is a great host, with quick and informative conversations.

I'd definitely stay again."
3238040,438737914,4/17/2019,We enjoyed our stay at here. Good value for the location and easy walking distance to center city. Nice quiet street close to Ranelagh shopping district.
3238040,439624533,4/19/2019,"Lovely room, very clean and plenty of space for two. Powerful shower and heater works well to heat the room."
3238040,443587419,4/26/2019,"Rodrigos accommodation was great for our short trip to Dublin, but itd be perfect for a long stay. There was plenty of space for the two of us, and the apartment is in a beautiful neighbourhood. A short, 20-30 minute walk into Temple Bar and surrounding area made travelling around the city very easy. We would highly recommend staying at Rodrigos accommodation for your trip to Dublin."
3238040,444686580,4/28/2019,"Really happy with my stay here, was exactly as described. So close to the centre, especially using the trams. Would definitely stay here again if I was to visit Dublin again."
3238040,447946781,5/4/2019,"Overall we had a nice stay in the appartment (the hot shower and the location were really positive). However, if you travel in early spring, like us, and the outside temperature is around 5-10 degrees celsius, the appartment is not really warm."
3238040,450828352,5/10/2019,We had an amazing time in Dublin while staying at the apartment! The room is nice and cosy.
3238040,454501022,5/18/2019,"It was amazing place! I stayed there because it was near my office. The place is 10mins Walk from the air coach from Airport but it was fine. There is no washer but the place get really chilly at night if you dont switch on heater and the heater will switch off itself in the middle of the night. But, it is a lovely apartment."
3238040,456371138,5/21/2019,Fantastisch appartement met een goede bereikbaarheid tot het centrum op een rustige locatie.
3238040,457957326,5/25/2019,"Roderigo's place is just as described on the website and by other travellers.  Communication and ease of access could not have been better. It's simply a very compact bedroom with an adjoining shower room. The outside front terrace with seating is nice if the sun shines.  The road and area of Ranelagh are charming (and the main reason we chose to stay there). There is easy and fast access to the centre of the city. 
All good!"
3238040,459405536,5/27/2019,"Loved our stay in this property. Rodrigo always responded very promptly to messages. He took the time to contact us a couple of days prior to the trip containing really useful information about the quickest/recommended way to travel by aircoach (700 route) to the property from the airport, including which stop - information which makes your journey a lot easier! The journey from the airport couldn't have been easier and helps when you can leave bags prior to check-in.  We walked from the property to the central parts on the City throughout our weekend, roughly 10 mins to St Stephen's Green and about 25 mins to the Temple Bar area. The room was really clean with a very comfortable bed."
3238040,460880825,5/30/2019,Everything was clean and comfortable. There is a small bathroom without window and you have to go through the bathroom to get to the sleeping room. But it was a very cosy and nice room to stay for three nights in dublin.
3238040,463409294,6/3/2019,Rodrigos place was perfect for a weekend stay in Dublin. The location was ideal and within walking distance from plenty of nice restaurants and bars. The street itself was nice and quiet and the room had everything we needed when we were done exploring. Thanks again for a great stay!
3238040,464659658,6/6/2019,"Rodrigos space is perfect for one person or a couple looking to explore Dublin. It was very clean, comfortable and well located. We were able to utilize the public transportation to anywhere we wanted to go. The local bar (Blackbird) we visited twice was within 10 minutes walking distance and was a great place to have a beer!"
3238040,466386201,6/9/2019,Great place to stay.  Good value for money.  Close to transport and only 25 min walk to city  and dart
3238040,471265945,6/17/2019,"Really happy with this little apartment, great instructions for when we arrived, we left our bags after the time we were told we could as we were early, the cleaner kindly moved our bags neatly into the room once she'd done her job. Lovely place and only 10/15 minute walk from the centre, would defo stay again as the price and cleanliness of the place was fab! Trustworthy airbnb :D"
3238040,473214284,6/21/2019,Bright room in a beautiful neighborhood. Comfortable bed and good shower. Close to airport shuttle bus and light rail into Dublin City Centre. Rodrigo could not have been more helpful or responsive.
3238040,474724525,6/23/2019,A comfortable place to stay close to Dublin centre. Check in was really easy and the place was immaculate. Would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!

3238040,478071907,6/29/2019,This is a perfect base to explore Dublin and the location is fantastic with lots of great restaurants and coffee shops within a very short walk. We would definitely stay again.
3238040,480312410,7/2/2019,"A terrific location to all the amenities, really enjoyed the Ranalagh Village around the corner and had great dinners there.   Easy walk into tourist spots.  Our private bedroom was very quaint and just as expected.   We enjoyed the patio area when the sun was shining.  The bed was comfy and good shower.  (note the entry is at the front and through the bathroom, but no big deal)."
3238040,489800260,7/17/2019,"The place was nice and in a cool area of Dublin. We felt safe here and enjoyed the space. 
We would have enjoyed more than one towel per guest considering we were staying at this Airbnb for four nights. 
Other than that, check in was easy as it was self check in and we enjoyed the private entrance to our room."
3238040,491609127,7/20/2019,"very nice place, central, Rodrigo is very kind -  suggest!"
3238040,498211058,7/29/2019,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3238040,499929248,8/1/2019,"Rodrigo was a FANTASTIC host! Easy check-in/check-out and quick responses if needed.

The location couldnt have been more perfect! Easy access to public transit and a beautiful part of town. If were ever back in Dublin, well definitely try to stay with Rodrigo again!"

3238040,510504746,8/16/2019,"The place was on a beautiful street, very easy to get to through the use of the city buses. There were plenty of little shops and cafes near.

The room itself was everything we needed for a 3 night stop over, bed was comfortable, bathroom was very clean. 

Dublin was a very lively, cultural city, definitely coming back in the future!"
3238040,513907147,8/20/2019,Small studio and close to public transport. Easy to find and get in and out of. Very clean and easy thanks!

3238040,553433553,10/24/2019,"Rodrigo's place is simple but stylish and very clean, just what I needed for a couple of nights. Rodrigo is very easy to contact. There is access to the Luas stop and it was good to be able to walk home from the Luas stop as it is such a safe area; Ranelagh, which is about 5 minutes walk, is a lovely high street with lots of cafes, restaurants, bars. Rodrigo's  was a simple , convenient spot in a picturesque part of Dublin and I will look to stay here again."

3268119,422020926,3/10/2019,"Its a well located room in Leigh Annes family house. We arrived very late for flights issues and Leigh Anne was there waiting for us. 
She and her family were so lovely and made us feel so welcomed, we forgot we were not at home. 
If we go back to Dublin, and we have to, well surely talk to them.
Call us when you come to Spain, please!

Very close to the bus stop with a nice short walk. We would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone looking for a stay outside of the city center.
3268119,458772902,5/26/2019,"You will be sure of a warm, friendly welcome from a lovely family.  Great location, close to the city and all its attractions.  The accommodation was spotless and parking is not a problem.  Highly recommended."
3268119,463364811,6/3/2019,"Lovely place to stay, Leigh-Ann and David are very friendly and helpful. Their dog Sammie is adorable and she loves visitors. The bedroom is located parallel to the kitchen between the main living area and the guest living/shared space and is therefore not completely private but this was not at all an issue. Had a relaxing, peaceful and enjoyable stay, thanks guys!"
3268119,466356487,6/9/2019,"Leigh-Ann's description was most accurate.
We recommend their accommodation."
3268119,469278751,6/14/2019,A lovely family and a clean and quiet space. The bed was excellent!
3268119,474728439,6/23/2019,Leigh-Ann is an excellent host.  The accommodations were exactly as described and it is quite convenient to the bus stop.  She gives excellent advise and clear directions on how to get anywhere.  The bed is comfortable and the area is extremely quiet at night.  I recommend this Airbnb highly!
3268119,477360685,6/28/2019,"This place has everything you need.  A large comfortable bed, a private bath, your own sitting area, wonderful hosts, and a location very close to transportation into Dublin city.  Pubs and places to eat are within walking distance.  Communication with Leigh-Ann was easy and prompt, and everything was as presented in the ad.  We would go back."
3268119,479664777,7/1/2019,Thanks for making our stay special
3268119,480709895,7/3/2019,Leigh Ann has looked really well after us. The space was sparkling clean and really lovely. The location is amazing! Thanks a lot again!
3268119,484170580,7/8/2019,This is a great location for going to the city centre and being able to get to Howth by bike so you can enjoy the busy city and beautiful scenery. Leigh-Ann and her husband were very helpful and had lots of great suggestions.
3268119,485777962,7/11/2019,"The location is great and the space is immaculate. She makes you feel like a welcomed long-time friend and that, to me, made the stay special. Easy access to downtown and a pub nearby too for a quick drink, this spot has everything you need and more."
3268119,486918637,7/13/2019,Leigh Ann is a magnificent host! She is friendly and helpful! The place is sparkling clean and very comfortable!!
3268119,488724368,7/15/2019,Leigh-Ann and her family were very welcoming. The location was very convenient with a bus stop to the city a few mins walk from the house. The room was very clean and comfortable. We had a great stay!
3268119,517364253,8/25/2019,"If youre on the search for a place to stay in Dublin and enjoy staying somewhere thats clean, private, and enjoyable then look no further. 
Leigh-Ann and her family were unbelievably welcoming to myself and my partner on our transition to Ireland. We have both moved here to attend one of the universitys for the year, and needed to search for a place to live. We found Leigh-Ann and stayed at her house for about 3 weeks. She gave us advice about how to navigate public transportation and tips on trying to find an apartment in the bustling city of Dublin. 
There was never a moment that felt as though her family wanted us to leave, because Im sure 3 weeks can be rather overwhelming to most individuals. However, Leigh-Ann was always asking us how our days went when returning and asking if we needed anymore help. She even went as far to write a reference letter for us, which was more than we could ask for. 
Honestly, this became more than just an AirBnB for us, it felt almost like a home away from home during our stay. I could have never asked for anything better than our visit to Leigh-Anns. 
So, if you would like to stay in a place that truly loves having your company during your adventures in Dublin, then you have found the place that youre meant to be. 
My partner and I are forever grateful to Leigh-Ann and her wonderful family, and we will definitely keep in touch."
3268119,522601745,9/2/2019,Very friendly family.
3268119,523761100,9/4/2019,"The stay in Clontarf was really comfortable! Everything was clean and we had enough space for our luggage. It was also nice that we had the opportunity to use the livingroom on our own.
 Leigh-Ann also provided a little breakfast for us.

The communication was very easy and always friendly and there was a quiet and relaxed atmosphere in the house. 
You can get into the city by bus within 15-20. Furthermore you are living almost next to the sea, if you stay at Leigh-Anns house and there are two pubs and 3 restaurants near to the house. I can recommend the accomodation!"
3268119,527150277,9/10/2019,"...what can you say what is not already written? I don¬¥t wanna write again what everybody has written. sure everything is mostly  correct about a small bedroom and a bathroom without window, but hey, you¬¥re on holiday not at your home!!! if you wanna have something represantive, something big, something you can post at social media, please go anywhere else and leave this beautiful and more than kind place on earth for the real backpacker. here you will get the single chance to dive in and get contact with a young family who is willing to let you take part. this was so emotional and friendly. Thank you Leigh-Ann and may the sun Always shine on you. Hope to see you again. Angela&Andre S."

3268119,536228554,9/26/2019,We had a very comfortable stay at Leigh-Anns home. She also accommodated letting us drop our bags and giving the house key early so we were able to go into Dublin to enjoy the afternoon & evening after returning our rental. We got to and from the city with ease via a 20min bus ride (need change 3euros/ride). We were ok with doing a lot of walking downtown Dublin once the bus dropped us off near OConnell street & River Liffey. Do make sure to note the description about house rules/hours of use (6pm-10am). This wasnt a problem for us because we stayed out exploring in downtown Dublin all day until 9/10pm. We would recommend staying with Leigh-Ann!
3268119,542317921,10/6/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at LA's place very much. The place was very cozy, warm, with good atmosphere. Ann made sure we always had everything we needed throughout the whole stay there. Everyday when we returned back from a day at city, there was a warm, nice and clean place waiting for us, where we could rest. The area was very quiet, we havent had a better sleep in years! :)"
3268119,545487928,10/12/2019,"Leigh-Ann and David were very welcoming and everything was just as described. The bed was super comfortable and I had lots of privacy!

Things that are helpful to know:
- the house is not within walking distance of the city centre - personally, I think it's completely worth the peace and quiet you get during the night which you certainly won't get in a flat in the inner city. However, the bus stop is about a five minute walk away from the front door and the bus will drop you smack-dab in the middle of Dublin city. If you're planning on dropping in multiple times during the day, it might not be for you. I usually left in the morning and came back in the evening and found the location wonderful.
- Leigh-Ann has a very young, enthusiastic dog. I love dogs and she was very, very sweet. If you're scared of dogs, again, this listing might not be for you.
- the listing stated one of the house rules as no showers past 10pm, which at first led me to believe there was some sort of ""curfew"" as well; there isn't. I came home after 10pm a few times and it was never a problem. Long story short, if you want to stay up late haunting Dublin's pubs, you can. Just be considerate of the fact that other people are sleeping in this house as well. 

I had a great time and I'm sure you will too, because Leigh-Ann is a very good host!"
3268119,553423660,10/24/2019,The best host you'll ever have!! Leigh-Ann is always available to give advise and will assist in any way she can.  Her whole family is very welcoming and makes you feel at home.
3268119,562760934,11/11/2019,"Great location, 20min from city center by bus, close to sea
Owners are very kind and helpful.
Bedroom is very, very small but nice
Water system is very noisy, it's forbidden to take shower after 22h not to wake up owners (a bit annoying after long day in city center)
Coffee offered but not real breakfast
Though good value for price"
3268119,565999437,11/18/2019,We had a good time in Dublin! Leigh-Ann is a very good host and we felt at home right away. The room was very nice and clean and we loved their dog Sammie! Next time we're in Dublin we would definitly go back here!
3268119,568433394,11/24/2019,Lovely couple and lovely house. Would be delighted to stay again.
3295492,426537010,3/21/2019,100% recommendable. Everything was perfect!

3295492,459276006,5/27/2019,"Ed and Juliane were great hosts, even the noise that they mentioned on publication never was a problem for us. They have a great place, and a good location to reach the downtown "
3295492,552708678,10/22/2019,Good people and great place. Close to bus station and shops. Just 20 min by walking to the centre. Highly recommended.
3295492,555195482,10/27/2019,"Cosy and clean room with a comfortable environment. 
The house is in a peaceful neighborhood, close to the city center and Phoenix park. It's well communicated with Luas, bus and Dublin-bikes. Easy to arrive from the airport with bus 16 (you only have to walk 15 minutes). 
The host will answer all your questions quickly, and that is really helpfull. 
If I need a room in Dublin again, I'm sure I'll go back again.
Thanks guys!!"
3316532,478013429,6/29/2019,great location and host
3316532,502198121,8/4/2019,"The house is beautifully located by the sea. A bus stop is just around the corner, and the next DART station about a 20 min walk away (and it¬¥s definitely worth every walk you take, as the area is really nice). The Forty Foot beach, a wonderful promenade for evening walks, a supermarket and lovely little restaurants are in walking distance. This area of the city is definitely one of the most beautiful ones.

The house and the rooms are really lovely, clean and cozy. The kitchen and the bathroom both are big, clean, and easy to use, you will find everything you need there. As kitchen and dining room are one, you can cook and eat both with a gorgeous view outside over garden and sea. The garden is a gem, as it is very large and you can sit there and watch sunset and sunrise. 

Suzanne is a lovely host. She welcomes you, guides you through everything you need to know, explains everything patiently, answers every question that one might have. I really enjoyed my stay there and can recommend this accomodation and the host from the heart."
3316532,520938907,8/31/2019,"Susanna's place is located in a great location with fantastic views of the sea and in a quiet area. Susanna is friendly, easy-going, open, chatty and flexible. The rooms are clean and guests can use the kitchen. There is added bonus with a large area outside to watch the sea, swimmers and vessels passing by. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Dublin."

3327938,437141040,4/14/2019,3 lovely month in Crea's house ! The accomodation is perfect ! Near the city center by walk or public transport. There is all you need around the house. I can only recommend!
3327938,478945839,6/30/2019,I had a confortable 2 months long stay at Crea¬¥a place. She is a nice person always available for any kind of help. The neighborhood is maybe not one of the best in Dublin but it is located in a very convenient position and the house is very close to the bus stop leading to the city center. The room is big and the bed confortable. Crea would sometimes have guests staying overnight for few days but I never got bothered regarding that. Overall a nice stay except for a little accident happened over a weekend when there was a break in into the house while no one was there and my smartphone was stolen. Maybe setting on the alarm of the house would have prevented that and I think she will do it from now on. Except for this my stay was good.
3327938,484724002,7/9/2019,"Crea is very hospitable and generous. She has a lovely home and the room and bathroom are clean and very comfortable. I felt welcome and at home and while I was able to be independent and do my own thing, Crea was always on hand to provide advice or help if I needed it. I thoroughly recommend her home as a place to stay."
3327938,528562647,9/13/2019,Crea is a fantastic host. I can't recommend her enough. She was so kind and chilled. The house is bright and welcoming. The room is big and bed is so comfortable. Crea has thought of everything. It's super easy to get to town by bus and tram (luas). Fantastic stay! Thanks Crea!
3327938,553914167,10/25/2019,"I absolutely loved staying at Creas place. The house and room were nice, cozy and warm, and more than anything, Crea is such a lovely, caring person who welcomed me warmly and helped me with a lot of things. I always enjoyed chatting with her with a nice cup of tea/coffee. I definitely recommend to everyone!"
3333378,418963413,3/3/2019,"My stay was amazing at Mary and Jasons home. The view from the bedrooms windows is breathtaking : from sunrise to sunset you can enjoy the seaside. It was so nice to cook here the flat is perfectly arranged. Everything can be done by walk : supermarket, pubs, hiking path. 
Thanks a lot for your tips and reactivity for everything. Hope I can come back very soon."
3333378,437100395,4/14/2019,"Excellent location by the beach, walking distance to a pub and bus stops."
3333378,443661077,4/26/2019,Great location right on the beach...
3333378,445375543,4/29/2019,Great place for right time of year to enjoy the beach.  Walkable to town and good restaurants.
3333378,446368466,5/1/2019,"Mary and John's place was great! The location on the beach of the Irish Sea is just gorgeous and so convenient to the little town where we were able to get a delicious dinner! The place was decorated very nicely, it was comfortable and clean and Mary was very friendly making sure we had all we needed at check in. It was also very quick and easy to communicate about checking in and when we had a question about checking out. It was close enough to Dublin and the airport but far enough away to be super peaceful. We really enjoyed our stay, it was a perfect way to end a beautiful holiday."
3333378,453255496,5/15/2019,"Fabulous views and beach. Some of the best pub food in Ireland, great Guinness and an amazing view to have breakfast too"
3333378,457994699,5/25/2019,Wonderful location on the beach. Plenty of room & clean. Resturants In walking distance down the beach. Mary is very friendly host. Easy commute to Dublin by train.
3333378,459441466,5/27/2019,"Lovely place to stay! It was beyond our expectations, clean, cozy and comfortable!"
3333378,469759600,6/15/2019,Great stay at this air bnb. Its right on the Irish Sea and has great views. Easily fit 5 people. Best to drive to the train station and then take the train into the city center
3333378,474619812,6/23/2019,Mary and Jason were excellent hosts. They had a sheet of all local amenities in the area which was very helpful. The place was spotless and the location was gorgeous. Would highly recommend them as hosts.
3333378,476549459,6/26/2019,"We were extremely disappointed with both the property and hostess. 
The property is hidden in the back of a sketchy area.
The hostess was not welcoming. In fact,  she was irritated and abrupt upon check in. She became very defensive about her property. There were stains on the sheets and we heard rodents in the ceiling during the night.  For theses reasons, we checked out in the morning and didnt stay a 2nd night as planned and Mary would not refund the fee."
3333378,478857158,6/30/2019,"Los departamentos de Mary y Jason son muy lindos , con camas muy comodas y equipamiento general muy completo."
3333378,480307194,7/2/2019,Beautiful location and apartment.   Everything was clean and big enough for all 5 if us.  Great hospitality especially when flight was delayed and arrived late.  Communication was easy.  Would definitely stay again.
3333378,498259362,7/29/2019,"This place is spectacular! Great location on the beach, kind and attentive host in Mary, close to transport to Dublin. We enjoyed getting to know Rush a little and loved our time on the beautiful beach. The apartments themselves are lovely and homey, with wonderful patios and (Email hidden by Airbnb) munications were easy. Mary is an ideal host. We will be back."
3333378,519904465,8/29/2019,"What a gem! Beautiful apartment in a stunning location. Immaculate, had everything we needed. We had a wonderful stay. Mary and Jacob were very helpful with any questions I had before hand and were very helpful whilst we were there. The beach is second to none and to have it right on your doorstep was a treat. We will definitely be coming back."
3333378,522632737,9/2/2019,The time we spend at Mary's place was absolutely great. The apartment is very nice and it's located directly at the  beach. We enjoyed it a lot.
3333378,539482153,10/1/2019,"Mary and Jasons place is right on the beach, comfortable and clean. There are
close by  restaurants and the view is wonderful."
3333378,542414623,10/6/2019,"Absolutely stunning location, beach outside the door, apartment very cosy, Mary an exceptional host!"
3333378,561359473,11/9/2019,Mary and Jason's place is amazing. The Irish Sea was outside our bedroom window. Mary and Jason are amazing hosts  and provided recommendations on anything we asked.
3345276,421359568,3/9/2019,"Location is FANTASTIC!!!! We were able to walk to the train and bus station and walk to restaurants, shops, and historical sites. The only taxi we needed was the short ride to and from the airport.  Even though the apartment is in the city center the building is situated in such a way that we never were disturbed by the noise of traffic and I was able to sleep through the night."
3345276,428521814,3/25/2019,This flat was exactly as advertised.  It was clean and comfortably furnished.  The beds were very comfortable and it was quiet at night.  The location was fabulous and close to all the major areas that we wanted to explore.  Stephen was the perfect host and accommodated our requests.  I have already recommended this rental to friends and family.
3345276,438666626,4/17/2019,"Our family was traveling to Dublin for a few days and were not expecting the experience we had. 

Once we were escorted into the apartment (after waiting outside in the cold for quite some time past check-in) the woman who escorted us tried to leave us there as quickly as she could. Once we settled in we realized that although the linens had been cleaned, the trash was still full and left out on the deck and there were leftover used bathroom products and makeup sponges in the bathroom. More upsetting than the cleanliness issue, was that the electricity ran out. During our second day stay we ran out of electricity and had to wait for the actual host to come and punch in the paid code to turn the electricity back on (in the meantime, we had to take cold showers and had no heat or fridge). We also had troubles with the water heater/closet - throughout our trip it made constant noises and the closet was full of rags covering old leaky pipes. 

When we contacted the host about these issues, he was responsive and apologetic, but separately gave us two differing excuses for why he was having a hard time. Unfortunate things happen, but when you pay for a place to stay there is a certain quality you expect. 

We loved the location, but were pretty disappointed overall, especially considering the price for this listing. This could really be such a great listing and experience, and we regret that it turned out this way."
3345276,442314012,4/23/2019,"This apartment is in a perfect part of town. Walking distance to every tourist area, literally across the street from Dublin Castle and about a 5-10 minute taxi ride to Guinness and Jameson distillery. Great place!"
3345276,450744967,5/10/2019,"Great location for easy walk to Trinity, Stephens Green and Temple Bar area. Very comfortable sleeping and quiet though close to busy night life. Stephen was very quick to respond to any communication. Enjoyed our stay."
3345276,454442003,5/18/2019,"The location of Stephen's apartment could not be better. It is close to everything with a walk or a very short taxi ride. This apartment has a lift/elevator, which we found very helpful. It has a secured entrance. We felt very safe. Stephen was immediate with responses and was very helpful during our stay in Dublin. The apartment is perfect for 3 people. You could make 4 work. The larger room has a queen-sized bed. The smaller room has 2 twin beds and not much extra space between the 2 beds. The kitchen had what we needed to make tea and have a quick breakfast. The bathroom has a tub and shower and is not cramped. It was a comfortable apartment and much better than a hotel, in our opinion! For the price and location, this was perfect for us."
3345276,456774988,5/22/2019,"Stephen is a thoughtful and flexible host. The apartment was very clean and the location is fantastic. However, every room is a bit smaller than I expected, based on the pictures, and I cannot recommend staying here if your group has 4 adults. For two or even three adults it would be great, and fine for 2 adults and a child or 2 (under 13).  We managed, but I would not stay here again with 4 adults."
3345276,458643145,5/26/2019,"Great place in a quiet street at a stone's throw from all the main places in Dublin.
Stephen was always quick to respond, and everything in the apartment was just fine.
We had a great time in Dublin, and a good taste of excellent Irish hospitality. Highly recommended!"
3345276,460857663,5/30/2019,"It was a great location and really comfortable! Rooms are cozy, and yes, a bit loud at night, but not as bad as others said. I really appreciated the easy check in and friendliness and the local tips! The only issue we ran into was with the hot water for the shower (we needed to boost it after each shower) and the slow flushing toilet (it took around 2 hrs to refill--which he said was normal). We managed! Well worth the great location!"
3345276,463413201,6/3/2019,Great location.  Stephen was a great host and gave us some wonderful food suggestions.  The twin beds and down comforters were very comfortable.
3345276,468740128,6/13/2019,"Stephen was a really nice host! We had a late check-in and a friend of stephen welcomed us. During the stay, stephen did message us if everything would be ok. He even offered us to leave our luggage a little longer in the appartment because our flight left in the evening. Thanks for that again!"
3345276,471347987,6/17/2019,"Amazing apartment, amazing location, host is fantastic and went above and beyond to assist us during our stay.  You will be happy you were able to book this amazing place in Dublin.  Hope to stay again someday."
3345276,472769627,6/20/2019,"Due to circumstances outside our control we couldnt stay here, but Stephen was quick to communicate with us and provide us with other accommodations."
3345276,490803042,7/19/2019,Place is in a great location.
3345276,494537877,7/24/2019,"Absolutely perfect central location, and a great flat. Stephen was a wonderful host, responded quickly, and had some awesome recommendations for places to try! Would absolutely stay here again!"
3345276,496437520,7/27/2019,"This apartment worked very well for our family of four, including 2 teenage boys. It was the perfect location for us - right in town and walking distance to everything, but quiet enough to be a retreat. The beds and couch were comfortable and we appreciated having Netflix to relax with during down time.  We also loved the little deck and the view. It would be great to have a couple of deck chairs available to make better use of that space. The biggest down side to this apartment is the plumbing. The toilet was bothersome - often didn't flush completely and needed a lot of time to refill. But, I'd read about this in previous reviews, so wasn't surprised. We got in the habit of using the restroom in restaurants or museums before returning to the apartment to make life easier. The shower is tricky, too. You couldn't leave it running or water would get all over the bathroom floor. And, as mentioned in other posts as well, the hot water tank (or something like that) in the hall closet drips continuously. All in all, this is a decent apartment with some quirks in a prime location. I wouldn't advertise it as ""luxury"", though."
3345276,498853359,7/30/2019,"Thanks again for the great stay ,in this quite place right in     the city center!Thanks  Victor for the warm welcome when  we arrived  late in the middle of the night.We hope to come back soon ,and from now on this  will be our address in Dublin!!"

3345276,513188532,8/19/2019,The apartment was lovely. Very comfortable and had pretty much everything we needed. Also a superb location for seeing Dublin from.
3345276,523373380,9/3/2019,A great place in the centre of Dublin city. We found that nearly everywhere we wanted to go was no more than a 5-7 minute walk.

3374950,423881757,3/15/2019,Great space in a great location and very warm and welcoming host. Would stay again without question!
3374950,428948481,3/26/2019,"I've waited a few days because I want to be constructive and have a clear head. I'll start with the positives: this space has a lot of potential. It's very private and roomy and within easy walking distance to city center. It's in an up-and-coming area with a very good cafe and restaurant around the corner. Well stocked corner shop across the road with all the basics.   BUT, this flat is in dire need of repairs and of a good deep clean. Much is broken, including shower cubicle doors which hang loose and don't close, a broken stair leading down to basement which is dangerous, most of the lights don't work and some are hanging broken from the ceiling with exposed wires.  Every dish or piece of cutlery we pulled out of the cupboard had food crusted on it. The floor in the kitchen was sticky and there were moldy rolls left on the counter.  The place had had a quick surface clean but  there is accumulated dust and grime in corners, along baseboards and behind doors. The shower stall really needs a going over with hard brush and bleach.... lots of pinky mold/bacteria that builds up on the grout between shower tiles.   On top of the state of repair/cleanliness, it was very disappointing that the flat wasn't ready for us when we arrived at 5pm, despite having confirmed the time the day before (and the listing saying checkin was anytime from 3pm). 

I hope these issues will be addressed before this property is let out to future renters."
3374950,449768213,5/7/2019,"So so. The Place has potential, but IT screams for some renovation or tiding up. Its a bit dirty, but you get used to it. For 3 days it was ok. There was a problem with the heating (there was no heating), and it was quite cold. Fionnula gave us additional heaters, so it was warm again. She was nice and helpful. Concerning the prices for Dublin, this was one of the cheapest. We had low expectations and it was just as we expected. The location is great because you need about 20 min by foot to the city center. If going for a weekend or so, its ok."
3374950,452574121,5/13/2019,"My wife and I had a horrendous experience with this AirBnB rental. While we found that the host was responsive during the booking process, that was not the case the day prior to or during our check-in. The day of arrival we tried to reach out to the host through Airbnb messages, (Hidden by Airbnb) , and SMS to see if we could check in early. We failed to receive any sort of response (later she claimed via Airbnb message to have sent a message earlier that did not go through but AirBnB customer support says that there was no issue with their system). When we arrived at the location early (~12:30-1pm) she did allow us to drop our bags off early and ~specifically~ said she would clean the place prior to the official check in time at 3pm. We left the location to allow time to clean and returned at 3pm. In person she stated that her son had been at home the previous night to party in Dublin and had used the rental the previous evening; later via AirBnB this changed to previous Airbnb rentersù. Upon return (during our official check-in) we began to experience severe issues with the property and host. 
The first issue we discovered was that the property had not been cleaned. A quick walkthrough showed several problems: the bed sheets were dirty, the sink was full of unwashed dishes, several used acrylic nails and false eyelashes were found on the couch and the bathroom floor, and general dirt and what appeared to be salad leaves on the floors. Further inspection revealed more worrying conditions than just general grime. The fridge had old food in it that expired months ago. The freezer was filled with frost and unusable. The toaster oven was covered in grim on the inside and clearly had not been cleaned in a while. There were lights falling out of the ceiling. In addition to 2 empty rolls of toilet paper on the holder, there was 1 spare toilet paper roll on the top of the cabinet in the bathroom, but this was thoroughly saturated with water and covered in dirt. The shower looked as though it had not been cleaned in a long time and appeared to have black mold on the grouting. There were makeup stains on one of the couch cushions. There is a door in the bed room that leads upstairs that you cannot lock from the renters side yet allows full access from the main house. However, most concerning is the fact that the dry wall above and behind the bed has water damage and peeling paint. Its clear there was or is a leak in those two areas and that the damage has yet to be addressed. This is concerning due to the possibility of mold behind the drywall. My personal observation is it appeared someone tried to scrub the walls with cleaning agent, however, these two locations were directly above the bed, and worse, in the murphy bed where the bed sits against the wall (meaning the mold from the wall was likely in contact with the bed).  
Within 20 min. of check-in we contacted AirBnB for resolution of the stated issues. After explaining the issue with the property and providing photo evidence of each issue to 2 different AirBnB customer service representative they finally contacted the host for resolution (more than one hour after the initial conversation and check-in). From my understanding upon discussion with the AirBnB rep, the host told AirBnB that we did not ask for the place to be cleaned when we showed up early. The host then showed up at our door and asked if we would like to leave so that she could clean the place. Bear in mind that this was the beginning stop of our honeymoon, where my wife and I had spent at least 20 hours non-stop in travel time, and it was now 5pm after spending over an hour on the phone trying to resolve this issue when we really wanted to eat and rest. We inquired as to how she would fix the larger issues like the dry wall, freezer, and very dirty shower grouting. Her response was a flustered and angry Ill tell you what¶thanks!ù She then angrily turned around and walked away. At this point AirBnB fully refunded our rental, but we were forced to find and book a hotel that evening with very limited options and time. AirBnB offered to help rebook us in a new AirBnB, however, due to the fact we had booked this accommodation weeks earlier, there were no other comparable options in either location or cost to the original booking. A hotel was the only available option to us at such a last minute, and the cheapest one cost us an additional $1,000 above what we expected to pay. AirBnB reimbursed $291 of this cost but it is still a substantial loss for us.   
This was an especially frustrating and disappointing start to our honeymoon, which included a large monetary loss and a wasted day and a half dealing with the host and AirBnB. We were fully aware of the limits to the accommodation we had booked and were not expecting a penthouse, but we were expecting it to be meet a basic level of cleanliness and safety. I cannot stress enough how much I would recommend staying away from this location and host due to the issues we had and monetary loss we suffered."
3374950,458011317,5/25/2019,"Perfect venue for events at Croke Park, just a few minutes walk away, lovely cafe round the corner for breakfast and a short walk into city centre."
3374950,462731211,6/2/2019,"Perfect space to yourself, with everything you need. Cosy and comfortable and absolutely everything we had hoped for. Will be the first place I look for if I ever come back to Dublin!"
3374950,468785561,6/13/2019,"We stayed for two nights at Fionnualas Place. 

Pros: 
We really did like the location in a nice neighbourhood with nice houses and in walking distance to Dublin center. 
Bed comfortable and clean
Fionnuala is nice and flexible with the arrival time. The check in was really quick but ok. Communication was easy. There was milk in the fridge and she left us some pastrys on our last night.

Cons:
Eventhough the Bed was clean and comfy the rest of the appartement needs a deep scrub. 
Specially bathroom and kitchen wasnt clean. It felt a bit as if every now and then one corner is cleaned. 
Specially the toilet and the sink in the bathroom were dirty. Also the fridge and the glases and cutlery in the kitchen

Conclusion:
If you dont care much about cleanness you get a clean and comfy bed in a nice neighbourhood"
3374950,469237518,6/14/2019,Convenient location for walking to city centre
3374950,472353385,6/19/2019,Wonderful place to stay that was much larger than I had anticipated. Hosts were very nice and super accommodating. I highly recommend this place and will be looking into again when I return to Dublin.
3374950,479776074,7/1/2019,"The house is on nice street close to the centrum of Dublin. Flat is under the pavement. It is a little bit unclean. But bed and bed linen are good and clean.
You can use bus to the centr (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) . For breakfast you can use very good Cloud cafe - just the corner on main street :-) For dinner you can use an excellent small italian restaurant Da Mimmo.
This accommodation is very good for 2-3 nights."
3374950,482251731,7/6/2019,"We where going to an event at Croke Park, location was ideal and very good value. Small but suited us for one night. We found the place to be basic and could be cleaner but nothing that was a big issue. Steps outside need replaced, wood is rotten in places and dangerous."
3374950,483269043,7/7/2019,Nice little flat easy walk into Dublin center
3374950,491582316,7/20/2019,"I feel as if you're renting an Airbnb its an extension of your home. I truly hope this host home is cleaner. This place is filthy. Too much detail to go into lets just say the ENTIRE place needs to be cleared out and scrubbed like its never been scrubbed before.  Walking barefoot just long enough to realize I needed to put shoes on ASAP. Never been mopped and rarely swept is my guess. I large collection of partially used personally product are left behind in the bathroom. Cabinets are full of opened food packages. 6 bottles of olive oil?  I get the impression someone lives here when not rented, which is ok. But you need to do more than just change the sheets when a guest is coming. it looked as the sheets were changed? It's listed as a 2 bed unit. When we arrived there was only 1 towel and ZERO toilet paper. Only one bed had sheets. I messaged  Fionnuala about more towels she stated that she didn't know how many people were coming? Two of us on the reservation, lets go with two.  Lights hanging from the ceiling, paint falling off. I paid $126.00 USD to stay one night. It's not worth $1.26 USD. Its all very unfortunate. This place could be great place is only host took a slight bit of pride in her rental. Fionnuala seems like a nice person. And was respectful of our privacy, but she need to spend a day scrubbing this place top to bottom.  I can't recommend this Airbnb. The only good thing about this place was the wifi speed."
3374950,497165713,7/28/2019,"Budget accommodation, unreliable communication with host, place looks not  maintained from outside, very bad smell by the front door. Kitchen is not functional, uncomfortable bed, all of this would  have been ok IF...  we has been able to sleep !  First night loud music until very late, 2nd night a  20 min dog barking session around 4am. It does appear that we were overcharged as well.  Did not use the kitchen at all ! So disappointed !"
3374950,499847526,8/1/2019,"First of all the check in was great,
Fionnuala came and showed us how the water worked etc so our first experience with her was good. However after our first night it just went from good to bad.
1) There were alot of flies around the apartment but we didn't let that bother us.
2) There was alot of dust around the place and it seemed like there was no cleaning done at all.
3) The shower was in such bad condition in a sense that the shower door was just hanging off a clip or something. The window by the room we could not open because of people smoking stuff etc and alot of rubbish was around which explains the flies.
4) The WORST was the noise issue.
She did not think for a second that there were people staying downstairs, loud music was played at night talking loudly and then on top of that dogs barking late at night. We didnt mind the noise during the day but it would be nice to have a quiet evening but we didn't have that here for the few days we stayed.

Please take into consideration as to what your getting yourself in for 
The description that is given about the page is NOT accurate there are things listed there that are not available like the washing machine for example. That is all i would say."
3374950,502221667,8/4/2019,Nice little basement great for crashing in after exploring Dublin in the day or night! Close enough to the city centre to walk but also easy enough to get a short bus or taxi ride.
3374950,506120319,8/10/2019,Fionnuala's place is really cosy and a great central location! We had a great stay.
3374950,508827306,8/13/2019,"Fionnuala is a nice, friendly and super fast responding host. The place is not to far from the city (15min walk). Also the GAA Museum and croke park stadium is just 5min away. There is a bus station nearby also. You will have as much private time as you need in here, because of your own entry. Nevertheless, the place was not the cleanest so I will check next time the comments if it will be better again."
3374950,514540474,8/21/2019,"When we looking for a place I read a few reviews criticising cleanliness and noise levels but we decided to go ahead. Im glad we did ì we found it fine. There is a note in the Airbnb description suggesting that guests not expect hotel standards, which is why the price is relatively low for a self-contained flat close to the centre. 

As for noise, I personally enjoyed the strains of Patti Smith and the Doors wafting down to us on the Saturday night. We had a previous experience with hosts who made us feel that we were breathing too loud, so this more relaxed attitude was most welcome!

We were in town to attend an event at the convention centre, so the location was very convenient. The bed and living room area was comfortable and lounge-worthy, which is what we needed after being out all day. 

On a critical note... It was already getting autumnal in the evenings, especially in a basement (Dublin is cooler than London, even in August). We wanted to put the heating on for a bit at night and discovered that it didnt work. There was also a damp odour, which turned out to be a problem with the drains.

I brought this up and it took a couple of tries to get the heating and the drain seen to. The first time or so we were told there was no problem and 'it wasn't cold'.  We also needed to ask for spoons (none in the kitchen) and towels. But once this was sorted out we were happy. 

Other guests should be aware there isn't really a full kitchen for cooking big meals ì there is a two-ring device in a corner that might have been difficult to cook in, plus a rather crochety toaster-oven. This wasn't a problem for us because we were at the convention most of the time and didn't do any cooking besides making coffee and toast. But it might be useful to point that out in the description for others.  

While taking the criticisms above into account, we did enjoy our stay and found Fionnulas place a nice little flat for our purposes. She's very friendly and I appreciated her interest in my writing too. I'd recommend it to others, especially if they're attending an event at the convention centre."
3374950,515134170,8/22/2019,"Great location, Small flat with double bed and sofabed, Kind host.
But very eclectic  / old fashioned, basic quality accommodation in need of a lot of TLC."

Rose was friendly and extremely helpful to provide travel tips, both within the city and traveling to other cities.  I love to stay out late, and this was not an issue returning to the apartment after hours. I would stay here again!"

3394094,451948871,5/12/2019,"I recently had the honor of sharing the home of Rose in Dublin.  If your looking for the 4-Seasons, this is not the place.  It is small, functional, affordable, location is wonderful and it is clean and cozy.  My host Rose could not have been nicer.  A complete delight to visit with and helpful with advice and directions.  Her friend had to check me in and he was super nice, even walked me to his favorite lunch spot down the road.  Rose works from home so she is very accessible.  WiFi and TV in the shared space, frig and cooking made available (I only used the microwave oven).  I felt like a roommate who had known her forever by the end of the stay.  She is originally from Brazil but speaks English with no issues at all.

Location is perfect to experience Dublin down town.  Buy a Leap Card and put about 5 euro per day you are staying.  You can always top-off at train stations or link to your credit card.  Guinness is a bus ride away (I walked back).  Howth is a train ride away, wonderful 1/2 day adventure and walk on the cliffs.  Great food all over!  Pints and pubs all around!  All the busses, pubs and trains have WiFi, so if you out of country no need for cellular service, just use WiFi for directions and calls.  Hint, stand next to a bus that is parked (out of service) and use the free WiFi for calls and maps).

Wear good shoes!  I did a lot of walking!

Thanks for the stay,

Cheers,

Jim"

3394094,480238115,7/2/2019,"The space is small (as advertised) but more than adequate for a single traveler. Rose makes you feel at home and provides her hand-picked recommendations for food and drink in various areas of the city. The location couldnt be better, as it is a short walk or bus ride to any major area of the city center (located within a minute or two walk from stops serving many bus routes). Highly recommended!!"
3394094,487525858,7/14/2019,"Rose was an amazing host. She gave me tips of places to see, place to eat and was extremely quick with all communication responses. Rose was a delightful host and I would not hesitate and to book a stay with her!"

3394094,537244366,9/28/2019,"You will have a wonderful stay at Roses flat.  She is very fast to answer any questions via the app, or text.  I very much appreciated the early check in so I could catch a nap before exploring Dublin!

Her flat is in a perfect location. The bus from Dublin Airport drops you off 2 blocks east, and the return stop is basically right outside the front door.  Access to the center of town, the Temple Bar area, is very easy via a 15 minute walk south, or via tram which stops a few blocks to the west.

The Kingfisher down the street at the corner opens at 8am for a fantastic breakfast, and in the evenings dinner is also great.

I highly recommend Roses flat for a stay in Dublin!!"

3411757,423881431,3/15/2019,"When you're traveling internationally, life is bound to get in the way at least once or twice, but when you have a host who responds immediately, does everything they can to help, and goes out of their way to take care of you and make things right, no amount of difficulties can't be remedied. These folks are truly amazing and made our lives so much easier! Not only is the place lovely and in a perfect location, but they'll do whatever they can to make you feel at home and to ensure you have the best trip to Ireland possible!"

It's right next to Kilmainham Gaol & it's easy to get into the city ( buses & cabs). 
I preferred that we weren't right in the centre as it was so busy . 
The pub across the road was good fun ( Patriots Inn) - lots of brilliant entertainment & nice food. 
I would definitely return to this apartment and this area."

3411757,440727876,4/21/2019,"Rachel was a fantastic host and the apartment was amazing.  Rachel personally met us to check us in and she was extremely patient as she waited around (we were late) for us to figure our way around a new city.  Our very personable host took us around the apartment to give us all the information we needed and took the time to see that we were comfortable.  Thank you so much for making our trip 1,000 times better!  This location is literally across the street from Kilmainham Gaol jail and has plenty of amenities in the immediate area.  If you are not driving, a bus stops at the jail so there is always easy transport to the heart of Dublin city.  If you are driving, it's a 6 to 10 minute drive to anywhere in Dublin.  Such a convenient location.  We would definitely look to stay here again if we are blessed with visiting Ireland again in the future!"
3411757,445503161,4/29/2019,Very cute space tucked away in an otherwise busy city. The privacy was fantastic but slightly difficult to locate unless guided which Geraldine was gracious to call. Its very close to the Gaol and War Memorial Gardens which I recommend walking to. Otherwise you will want to taxi into the city centre of Dublin as the place is a 25+ minute walk. Appreciated the travel pamphlets scattered through the apartment and overall amenities!
3411757,447352706,5/3/2019,"Its  a great place and very clean, close to the city center. If I go back to Dublin
I would stay there again if available"
3411757,450834789,5/10/2019,Great location and communication!
3411757,452570822,5/13/2019,Great little apartment! We were directly opposite the kilmainham jail and could jump on the hop on hop off buses which literally take you where we you would need to be! Arrival was easy and Rachel gave us a great tour and explained everything to us as well as giving us some great local tips! Close by to the zoo which is a great day out! The parks which are so abundant are lovely for a quiet walk around! We had a fantastic trip and can't wait to do it again!
3411757,456686432,5/22/2019,Great location close to all that make Dublin special. Safe location. I would love to spend more time here. Everything you would want from a superhost.
3411757,460531496,5/29/2019,In a great location and a wonderful home base to explore Ireland! Very much recommend for your next trip to Dublin!
3411757,465250876,6/7/2019,Great location and great host had a good time
3411757,466511020,6/9/2019,"A great place in a fantastic location, if you are happy to be a short walk outside of the city (don't let this put you off).  A great apartment with lots of little extras left over from previous guests, that we just did not expect."
3411757,470417048,6/16/2019,Terrific apartment.  Great location.  Awesome owner and manager.
3411757,473907640,6/22/2019,"The location of this place is wonderful: across from the pub and the jail; two blocks from a grocery, bakery, coffee shop, and bus stop. We appreciated all of the travel guides left for us and especially Rachel's patience during check in as our flight was delayed! The train noise others mentioned was almost unnoticeable; we thought it was distant thunder. 

Do note that the dishwasher is broken and seems to have been for a bit. The washing machine was broken during our visit but our sense was that was more recent."
3411757,477551803,6/28/2019,"We enjoyed our stay here, very warm welcome and a perfect location for exploring from. The washing machine wasn't working as it had been broken by some previous guests and the fan and some of the lights in the bathroom were also broken so a bit of maintenance needed but we still had a good stay."
3411757,481268227,7/4/2019,"Great appt, easy accesible by car including parking in garage. Restaurant next door, supermarket with good coffee bar around the corner. Irish pub on the corner. City centra is 30 mins walk while you pass the Guinness factory. Uber (meter only) is appr. ‚Ç¨ 22,-"
3411757,489196973,7/16/2019,The apartment is in a great location for visiting Dublin and has everything you would need. The rooms were comfortable and there is a little balcony. There are a few things that weren't working but that didn't interfere with our stay. Check-in took a while on a hot day but Geraldine was very helpful and chatty and the apartment was lovely and cool when we got in. I would happily stay again.
3411757,489807008,7/17/2019,"Nice and quiet, a bit further from Temple Bar area but if you are looking for a clean quiet place to sleep, this is perfect."
3411757,494508207,7/24/2019,"This place is very well located in Dublin with walking distance to a pub, bus station and stores. This place definitely needs some maintenance work as some of the things in the apartment didnt work during our stay."
3411757,496450146,7/27/2019,"Location was great and communication was efficient. Many things were not working; lights, washer, dishwasher, freezer and hot water for showering."
3411757,497086121,7/28/2019,Great location. Lovely apartment. Ideal for our nights stay.
3411757,498778858,7/30/2019,Great good sized apartment and great location as just across the road from the Gaol.  Walking distance to the Guinness Storehouse and short cab ride to Temple Bar. We really enjoyed our stay in Dublin.
3411757,499332440,7/31/2019,"Overall the apartment is lovely and is well located. Its in great proximity to eateries, shops and transport. Rachel was very nice and helpful throughout the whole process. 

There did seem to be a few things broken/ not working throughout the apartment. None of this bothered us as we were there for one night."
3411757,504191938,8/7/2019,"Geraldines place as one of the nicest, best located and real value of all the places I have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home.
Location is very convenient, near shops and public transport. Rachel was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this wonderful apartment!"
3411757,508781510,8/13/2019,"Location is perfect. Friendly reception. Nice apartment.
Place is in need for some maintenance. Dishwasser hadn't been working a long time (according to other guests). Shower didn't work properly. Most lights in the shower were broken and ventilation was also broken (and had also been for a long time). Smelly towels.
Do visit Kilmaonham goal. Must see!"
3411757,509983680,8/15/2019,"I highly recommend this accommodation.  Clean, spacious and excellent location.  Geraldine and Rachel were great hosts."
3411757,512511514,8/18/2019,"Hi there,
If you look for a modern and clean place, you should opt for Geraldine's place. Her flat is amazing so is the neighbourhood."
3411757,515649815,8/23/2019,Lovely apartment in a good location. Easy access to tram to get around. Opposite Kilmainham Gaol which is well worth a visit.
3411757,517362005,8/25/2019,"Great location, very clean, lots of room! They had lots of supplies for babies & children to stay there, if thats your situation."
3411757,519263694,8/28/2019,"Ideal location: Kilmainham Jail 3min away, right opposite recommended Dublin Bikes station (and another station nearby), 2min away from Hop on/Hop off bus stop, 20min to small but amazing Dublin zoo and 20min walk to/from Houston Station with Airport bus link.
Great apartment in quiet residential area with tea, coffee, salt and soap/gels included. We enjoyed our stay there, host was very accommodating about check-in and check-out times which gave us almost one day extra. Thank you."
3411757,524623212,9/6/2019,Great place to stay with a family while visiting Dublin.
3411757,526790963,9/9/2019,Lovely apartment in a fantastic location! The apartment was sparkling clean and Rachel was fabulous!
3411757,527985243,9/12/2019,"The apartment is in a great location - quiet,  secure and right near a bus stop. There were little bathroom supplies in case we forgot something which was nice. The apartment was also nice and clean."
3411757,530841969,9/16/2019,"Rachel was lovely, greeted us on arrival, and gave us a tour of the apartment. The location was very convenient-you are steps from Kilmainham Gaol, a city bus stop and bus stops for a couple of the hop on/hop off tours. There are a couple of pubs and a grocery store a short distance down the road. There is a cafe in the adjacent building that serves good coffee and light breakfast items.  We were a group of four and found that the apartment had sufficient space for us."
3411757,531402114,9/17/2019,This apt was amazing. Really great quality value. The place was really clean and very comfy. Parking free on premises was really handy. Im looking forward to coming back to Dublin and stay there again. Thanks!

The apartment is really spacious and has lovely little personal touches to make your stay better. 
We would really like to visit Dublin again and I would always chose to stay here. 
Absolutely fantastic - Thank you!"
3411757,535887286,9/25/2019,"The apartment is really lovely, beds are comfortable & great for a few people sharing. Close to amenities & transport. We loved our stay here & recommend it to anyone wanting a modern & comfy home away from home "
3411757,538927917,9/30/2019,"A great apartment in an excellent location. Rachel you were great
Thanks
Max"
3411757,539918209,10/2/2019,"We were extremely disappointed with the stay in general. We originally told the hosts that we would arrive by 6pm, but plans changed and we would be arriving by 3pm. We contacted the hosts hours before we arrived but werent finally responded to until much later. We called the 3 different hosts and not one of them answered until finally Richard picked up the phone and told us to meet at 5:15 at a Hilton(down the street from the apartment). 5:15 came and went, but nobody was there, finally we called Richard back and he said someone will be there shortly. Then, Rachel called us and told us to meet her at the cafe down the street(closer to the apartment). Rachel wasnt at the cafe when we arrived and had to call her to come out to meet again. Finally, we checked in.... PHEW. And... were additionally disappointed that the apartment wasnt cleaned upon our arrival. Rachel stated that she worked that day so she was finishing cleaning up as we were arriving. (Which could be why they didnt answer our calls, wanted to clean, but communication would have been nice). There were a couple of trash bags needing to be taken out, which she did after we arrived. We then experienced the following issues:
-There were supposed to be 2 double beds, but there was 1 double bed and 2 single beds.
-The dishwasher was broken.
-The shower head was broken and you had to hold it up to wash yourself.
-The pictures of the apartment were clearly old since there were different couches pictured and extremely worn down.
-Crumbs all over the counter next to the toaster.
-Broken siding down the hallway.
-Fan didnt work in the bathroom so you had to keep the door cracked to not fry the fuses(stayed by Rachel).
-Floors were extremely dirty; not swept or mopped.
-Freezer was completely frozen over and could not be used.

The location was the only saving point, but other than that we were very disappointed in the stay. We feel deceived by the pictures and by the description and feel as if that information should be updated. If you post a check-in at 3pm have the apartment cleaned and ready to go by 3pm, not after the hosts are present at 6pm. 

As a PS, the check out is leaving the keys in the broken letter box and running out to the car on the street."
3411757,543163771,10/7/2019,Lovely apartment in an excellent location. Good secure parking and the hop on hop off buses are literally over the road.
3411757,544081334,10/9/2019,Great location and sweet host.
3411757,547519175,10/15/2019,"Great location, a 20 minute walk to most tourist attractions in the city. 

Rachel was very sweet and answered all of our questions."
3411757,553105574,10/23/2019,"The five star reviews are all spot on ì this place is amazing! Fantastic location, clean, comfy and affordable. Im definitely going to stay again. Thank you for having us!"
3411757,554413347,10/26/2019,"We felt it was over priced as we had on going mainenance issues of broken dish washer, bathroom door didn' t lock. Surely when the host knew they had the appartment booked they should have made repairs or refunded some of the payment as they didn't fulfill what was paid for. Also rumbling noise of trains could be heard as the appartment is below ground level and poor mobil reception. Location was good."
3411757,557187638,10/31/2019,Very central location! Rachel checked us in and she was fabulous
3411757,558835812,11/3/2019,"A lovely, homely apartment just outside the centre of Dublin. Fantastic value for money. Would definitely come again."
3411757,560999712,11/8/2019,Had such a lovely stay here for my graduation in DCU. Rachel was so helpful and lovely. Would love to stay here again when I am up in Dublin as it is in a great location. Thanks again! 
3430811,529760564,9/15/2019,"Becca and Patrick were amazing hosts; kind, welcoming and accommodating. We felt right at home, and received many great tips about what to see in the city. The apartment is in a quiet area away from noise but a short walk from the bus that takes you right into the city. Would love to stay again!"
3441994,418411188,3/2/2019,Unfortunately I had to cancel my trip but Piotr was really helpful and understanding.
3441994,424935889,3/17/2019,"Piotrs place is great! Highly recommend it. The location is a quick ride to both city Centre and the airport. Thanks, Piotr!!"
3441994,440817143,4/21/2019,The bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Everything was organised and prepared. The communication was great. We didnt discuss that much because we left early in the morning and came back late but the woman was really kind with us ! I highly recommend to stay there ! Thanks a lot !
3441994,449248400,5/6/2019,"A very nice place to stay, very clean.
Piotr and his girlfriend are very nice and gave us great advice to enjoy Dublin!"
3441994,458697235,5/26/2019,"Piotr's place is a 20-25 mins direct busride to the city center, so it was quiet but still easy to get around. The room had everything we needed, and Piotr and his girlfriend were very welcoming and friendly people. They have two adorable, always excited dogs :) Altogether it was a very pleasant experience :)"
3441994,463937391,6/4/2019,"We had an amazing stay at Piotrs place! Really nice hosts, great location and 2 cute dogs. Thank you for your kindness and the very useful tips you gave us! "
3441994,466606416,6/9/2019,"Good location, about 10 minutes from the airport, good communication and quiet place for sleeping."
3441994,470617935,6/16/2019,"Had a good stay at Piotrs, their place is really close to the city centre with a bus stop right outside the house which made it great for us spending the weekend in Dublin. 
They were also really friendly and helped us with whatever we asked for."
3441994,483051020,7/7/2019,Lovely stay
3441994,507042051,8/11/2019,"Awesome place! Super close to the city, clean and very great hospitality!"
3441994,513219145,8/19/2019,"We had an excellent stay at Peter's. He was so helpful and welcoming and the place was sparkling clean. He had set out some snacks and coffee/tea supplies in the room which was a very lovely touch. The only downside is that it's about a 20 minute bus ride from the central city, and (like everything in Dublin!) the bus fare is somewhat expensive so it does add up over time. I would definitely recommend to a friend though, it was a very positive experience."
3441994,515127057,8/22/2019,lovely place with the cutest dogs ever :)
3441994,518104698,8/26/2019,Our hosts were extremely lovely and the place was exactly what we needed for our short stay in Dublin.
3441994,520280350,8/30/2019,Piotr and Monica are very welcoming.    My son loved playing with the two little dogs! Thanks for the ride to Howth and airport! Wish we could stay longer.
3441994,525819468,9/8/2019,"Warm welcome with practical help for transport, amenities etc. Clean room with tea/coffee amenities. So so convenient for the bus into town! 20 mins to OConnell Street."
3441994,528544717,9/13/2019,Piotr accommodated us very last minute and was an excellent communicator. The room was comfortable and clean. There was easy access to busses right around the corner.
3441994,531380506,9/17/2019,"Very kind.
Perfect room (with kettle and coffee at your disposal), and possibility to use the living areas without problems.
Very accommodating, I was able to arrive and leave at times different from those arranged on the application, and this was graciously accepted.
I recommend."
3441994,531849425,9/18/2019,Great place to stay and cute dogs!
3441994,537284792,9/28/2019,Sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeber!
3444486,425488036,3/18/2019,Place was okay. Good thing about it was the location. host was helpful in giving recommendations for things to do in Dublin.
3444486,431036533,3/31/2019,"Great little spot right in a cool area! Bailey was awesome, he gave us a bunch a tips for where to visit and places to see while we were there. The apartment was exactly what we needed for our stay!"
3444486,432240846,4/3/2019,"The location is fantastic! Its within walking distance to all major tourist spots and next to lots of restaurants and pubs. Because its in such a central location, it can get noisy at night. Bailey also knows a lot about Dublin and Ireland in general, so he gave us good suggestions on places to visit in other parts of Ireland."
3444486,433939723,4/7/2019,"very ideal to be in the city center , very nice cool & warm Welcome from Bailey"
3444486,437780439,4/15/2019,"Bailey's got everything you need if you want to kick off your stay in Ireland to a good start. A really good position, not too noisy even though you're right next to the temple bar, and really chill. If you've got questions, Bailey's here to give some really good tips about what to do in Dublin, he's got you covered."
3444486,442825091,4/24/2019,Very centralized in Temple Bar.
3444486,445947706,4/30/2019,Bailey was a fantastic host. He gave us a rundown of Dublin when we first arrived which was very helpful. The location of his place cannot be beat. Would definitely stay here again.
3444486,448475392,5/5/2019,"Bailey is an excellent host and offered great suggestions on things to see and do
. Location was perfect, everything is within walking distance."
3444486,450445141,5/9/2019,Perfect spot! Everything we wanted to see was very close. We thought we would use the buses more and didnt need to. Only heard the noise if we focused on it.
3444486,452510460,5/13/2019,"Couldn't ask for anymore really. Good host, would highly recommend."
3444486,453995522,5/17/2019,Best location in Dublin
3444486,460077216,5/28/2019,My daughter and I stayed at Baileys place while on holiday. Bailey is a great guy and was very knowledgeable about Ireland. It was lovely meeting him. His apartment is as described. I love that its in the heart of the city there is so much action. We cant wait to stay with Bailey again.
3444486,469171909,6/14/2019,"Super convenient location, there was a bit of street noise but otherwise a comfortable stay."
3444486,472664529,6/20/2019,"Bailey, the host, was Amazing! Gave us so many great tips. He went above and beyond what is expected of an airbnb host! The place is located in a great spot. The house was clean and stylish in a retro sort of way! I would definitely go back to this place if i decide to come back to Dublin for a visit!"
3444486,475957440,6/25/2019,"Bailey is a great hostel had great recommendations particularly for food near the flat. I thought it might be noisy being right above temple bar, but it really want bad at all. Stay here over a hotel for sure!"
3444486,483328799,7/7/2019,"My mate and I stayed at Bailey's lovely apartment over the weekend. It's located right next to the Temple Bar Pub and about 20 yards from the river, and we basically walked our way to all the nice places/ pubs/ restaurants/ casinos in Dublin. So yeah, of course, the location is just absolutely great - really doesn't get better than this!! It comes with its minor drawback though - it can get slightly noisy in the night from all the street murmuring but its hardly a problem if you shut the bedroom window. That apart, the apartment is quite nicely done with spacious bedroom and bathroom. Bailey was a fantastic host to us and was very helpful right from the day that we made our booking. I would recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Dublin to have a good time!"
3444486,490237878,7/18/2019,Great location good place to sleep
3444486,492532842,7/21/2019,"This accommodation has a great location, just in the middle of the Temple Bar neighborhood. The hosts (Bailey's parents) was really nice with us and recommended some good places in Dublin.
However, the facilities are really old and in bad conditions, and the shower head was broken, while the bathtub was dirty."
3444486,494373266,7/24/2019,"My son and I recently stayed at Baileys place. Bailey was super helpful with loads of advice about places to go in Dublin. We missed our first night because of a delayed flight and Bailey offered to let us stay an extra night,  no-charge, since we had missed the first. Our schedule didnt allow for us to take him up on that, but I was so impressed that he offered. The location is perfect. Cant think of a better place to stay location wise."
3444486,502060347,8/4/2019,"Bailey's place was fantastic!  Location was safe and perfectly situated to walk out the door and experience all the adventures of downtown Dublin! The room was super clean and had everything we 2 girls needed (including a hair dryer - so thoughtful!)  Bailey is incredibly kind, responsive (immediate responses to all questions), and very passionate about where he lives. He is a professional tour guide so he knows where you want to (and may not want) to go.  Overall would love to stay here again! Thank you so much Bailey for such a fabulous first trip/introduction to Ireland!"
3444486,514502190,8/21/2019,You can not get any closer to Temple Bar than Bailey's. He is a treasure trove of info for Dublin. He even had adapters in our room for us to use. If you want to be in the middle of it all and with someone who knows Dublin in and out Bailey's is a great place to stay!
3444486,530084636,9/15/2019,"Great location , only 20 meters from Temple bar - perfect for anyone wanting to explore the nightlife :)"
3444486,534935961,9/23/2019,Amazing location. Amazing host.
3448070,418959449,3/3/2019,Susans place was lovely! Very clean and stylish. Would recommend staying here - would definitely stay again
3448070,431027224,3/31/2019,"Our stay was brilliant! My whole family loved your flat and would 100% come back. The local area was lovely, we ate out at union 8 and got a birthday cake for my sister from the bakery up the road. Really couldnt have asked for more! Right on the bus route into town as well as a 5 min walk from the kilmanhaim jail where you could get on a hop on hop off bus tour! Couldnt recommend more!"
3448070,440139145,4/20/2019,"Susans property management team was very responsive throughout our stay. The apartment is bright with a large living room... but it needs many minor repairs, some general TLC (which we found surprising given the price). The bedrooms face on to a busy street, which could make it tough to get a good nights sleep. But the apartment is so conveniently located near a bus stop and tram, about 15 minutes from downtown."
3448070,447822538,5/4/2019,Susans place is very comfortable and clean. It was great for four adults.
3448070,451181497,5/11/2019,Everything as expected. We came with 5 people and the flat was big enough.
3448070,452451540,5/13/2019,"Susan's space was great for our group.  It's an easy walk to Guinness, Temple Bar and right on a main bus route.  Check in was easy and we were lucky to find street parking right across the road (free on Sunday.)  The street is quite busy, so a bit of traffic noise.  The apartment is bright and spacious, needs a little TLC but was very comfortable with lots of good quality linens and comfy beds.  A good place for friends or family to stay and keep to a reasonable budget with all mod cons."
3448070,463319519,6/3/2019,The host canceled this reservation 109 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3448070,463437695,6/3/2019,"This apartment is on a major road and unfortunately you can hear all the road noise. There was no coffee pods for the coffee maker unfortunately. Communication with the host is auto-generated as I got the exact same messages both times I stayed here. Overall was an good experience, good value for bigger group."
3448070,465674150,6/8/2019,"This was our second time staying here, overall the accommodations were okay. It was nice to find a big enough place for 6 people."
3448070,468014335,6/11/2019,Great place to stay. Value for money
3448070,477015083,6/27/2019,"The Susans house is confortable, it has all you need to stay a few days in Dublin. However, it is a bit noisy because the street has lot of traffic."
3448070,483061660,7/7/2019,"The apartment is stylish and well equipped in a non-touristy neighborhood with several good restaurants and a couple grocery stores within walking distance. One drawback is that it's on a busy street so there is noise from the traffic, but if you aren't sensitive to that then no worries."
3448070,487691238,7/14/2019,"we enjoyed our stay very much. location is great, you can reach the center by bus in a few minutes. we had a lot of space and it was clean. comfortable beds, helpful hosts - very easy to to reach and friendly.

3448070,501118221,8/3/2019,"This apartment is in a very convenient location, close to public transport, and food. We toured a great percentage of Dublin and the eastern coast without ever renting a car. The road out front is a little busy but quieted down at night. All in all, a very pleasant stay."
3448070,503080104,8/5/2019,"Nice size apartment providing good value to spread out. Susan is a great communicator!   Good access to transport to Dublin Centre.  

Only one note, this apartment is on the 1st floor on a very busy street and there is no air conditioning, so a bit noisy as windows must be open for air circulation."

3448070,535846260,9/25/2019,"Susan was able to accept my last minute booking request when my original Airbnb canceled on me. However, her communication was not the best when it came to check-in times. The time when booking is set at 3:00pm. She then messaged me that it would not be ready until 5:15pm, and then later on messaged me again that she made it possible for a 3:00 check-in when in fact it was not ready. I had no car and the weather was terrible, she never told me when the apartment was ready. She said I could drop my luggage off but never got in contact with the cleaners to let me in. There were also broken things throughout the apartment. The toilet and light were broken in the second bathroom. The floorboard was broken in the entrance to the master bedroom. The carpet in the living room was dirty and one of the sofa beds was broken. However, the rest of the apartment was very clean and it was in a nice location."
3448070,543208119,10/7/2019,Had a great stay here check in was quick and easy with a spacious and well set out living area. Good location just a short ride to the Centre of all the bars and restaurants.

Susan was very responsive to all of my emails. We had a great stay!"
3448070,561993677,11/10/2019,"Really nice apartment, above my expectations.
The automatic check in and check out was really fast and easy.
The flat big and clean.
The only less positive thing was the noise from the street and the walking distance from the center (25 minutes) but there are buses and taxi. I would come back."

3474511,427882965,3/24/2019,Kieran is a great guy and clearly takes hosting very seriously. The room was immaculate and had lots of nice little touches. He gave us good pointers for getting the most of a short stay in Dublin.
3474511,432288779,4/3/2019,"Kieran made our visit to Dublin a rousing success. Our plane arrived early, and he was not only accommodating in letting us drop off our bags, but was there with a map and tons of great recommendations for places to go and things to do in Dublin. He steered us towards some great eateries and we had a lovely time during our four day stay. The room was perfect, full of personal touches and everything we might need, from water and glasses to a hair dryer, space to hang and store clothes, a tv with Netflix provided and even travel adapters in more than one socket so we could plug in our devices. We were over the moon. If it was warmer we would have used the garden patio area, which was cute. Breakfast was three different cereals, coffee, various teas, oj, milk, bread (with several jams and Nutella available) and fruit. Honestly, if we had been able to stay an extra day we would have just to enjoy the home away from home vibe. Spotless bathroom and plenty of towels and a comfy bed rounded out the great experience. He was generous as a host in every way. Would definitely stay here again if in Dublin, without a doubt."
3474511,432587503,4/4/2019,"Great location,and superb host,Kieran is a very knowledgeable guy and was able to point me to a great Vegan restaurent nearby...amazing food"
3474511,433914191,4/7/2019,"Very nice place to stay in Dublin. Kieran is a great host. His spotless two bedroom flat is a 10-15 min walk away from the Temple Bar area. When I was here Kieran had to travel elsewhere so had the flat to myself from the day after I checked in. Kieran has plenty of local info and was happy to chat about Dublin, sights etc. A simple non cooked breakfast was also available every day as well as use of the kitchen for teas and coffee. If I were to visit Dublin again I would be more than happy to stay at Kierans place again"

3474511,439627758,4/19/2019,"5 Stars all around, for everything at Kieran's residence. 
My girlfriend and I were returning to Dublin after a week of traveling through Ireland, and we stayed at Kieran's place. We were already excited to book his spot weeks ahead of time, but so pleasantly surprised at how awesome our experience was. 

Easy place to find, with an actual address (a lot of places in Ireland do not have an address believe it or not). Kieran is hyper responsive to all communications and provided three different ways to reach his home: Taxi, public transportation, and train even. Talk about above and beyond. 

His location is a 10 min walk to Temple Bar Square, and even when you walk around the corner, there are a ton of restaurants and pubs to enjoy. The residence itself is very cozy, stylish, and 100% sparkling clean. We were provided a comfortable bed, bath robes, water and glasses in our rooms, snacks, and a full selection for breakfast in the morning. It was truly a home away from home. Kieran has Netflix set up in the bedroom and we could sign in in the living room if we wanted too. 

Also, he is a wealth of knowledge for the city so you can ask him anything and he is very helpful with recommendations. When we visit Dublin again, we are 1000% booking with Kieran if he has availability."
3474511,441682163,4/22/2019,Kierans place is situated perfectly to explore the city. He was a great host and thoughtful gifting us an Easter egg on Easter Sunday at breakfast was a very nice touch. Would definitely recommend and book again
3474511,445492218,4/29/2019,"Kieran's place is immaculately clean with great access to Dublin highlights. I so appreciate the lengths he went to make our stay as easy as possible, especially in the form of directions from the airport to his home, as well as numerous photo map files of his specific area. Thanks Kieran for your wonderful hospitality!"
3474511,446868155,5/2/2019,"Kieran is a lovely host.  Helpful with local tips, advice, and recommendations.  His home is clean,  quiet, and very handy to all that Dublin offers.

My partner and I had stayed in Temple Bar the week before but much preferred this area due to access to local bars and cafes for breakfast. A two minute walk to the bus stop to make our way to the airport. Kieran was up for a chat or to leave us be when required. The bathroom had a nice shower that had flowing hot water. Stay here if you want to be a little off the beaten track but close to the city centre."
3474511,463503857,6/3/2019,"Kieran's place was one of the best decisions we made on our trip. His location is perfect for downtown experiences, and it was walking distance to all our favorite pubs, restaurants, and attractions. The accommodations were truly hotel grade - Kieran's little touches like chocolates and chilled water and breakfast set out each morning were above and beyond expectations. He has a collection of maps of the city and various resources for you to use, and he's full of amazing suggestions, recommendations, and local neighborhood history.  The bedroom was spotless and comfortable, and Kieran even hooked up guest access to Netflix on the TV in the room. You have access to a back patio that gets fantastic morning sunlight as well. We would stay with Kieran again in a heartbeat."

Kieran himself is a super accommodating, hospitable, and communicative host that made us feel at home right away. The local travel/transportation tips and complimentary breakfast in the morning really set him apart as a host, as well. Would absolutely recommend staying here! Thanks for a great stay!"

The room has a nice sitting area on the outside that was nice to use in the evening. The bed is firm but comfortable.  The shower is hot. Kieran was extremely helpful during our stay, even ordering us a taxi on the day of our departure. Breakfast was great and helped get our day started.

The amenities and the details he put into the accommodation were very thoughtful, from the water and chocolates he left for us in the room to the lotions and shampoo provided in the bathroom. He had a simple but beautiful breakfast spread for us in the morning as well. The location was great and his place was spotless! I would definitely recommend staying here!"
3474511,497022007,7/28/2019,"Kieran's place is filled with books and music with everything neat and tidy.  It is stylish in a reserved way.  By that, I mean the apartment does not hit you in the face with trendiness but presents the care on the part of the owner.  Once you get the hang of Dublin -- which is not an easy city to find one's way around -- you realize that Kieran lives closer to the center of things than you might guess from looking at a map.  A tram runs just two blocks away that will take you to O'Connell street with a stop in front of the General Post Office.

He offers a comfortable room with plenty of storage and access to small patio, should you like to spend time outside at breakfast or reading maps.  He also provides a simple breakfast of coffee or tea, juice and milk, with bread for toasting as well as cereal.  

Kieran seems to know every bit of Dublin.  He is a good source of information.  However, he works out of his home and respecting his time is the guest's responsibility.  The bathroom is shared."
3474511,499978506,8/1/2019,Kieran is a great and super friendly host  I felt well al the time. The room is nice and comfortable. I had everything I needed. Will come again. Thank you very much. All the best

3474511,503731001,8/6/2019,"Kieran was my first host in Dublin, and I couldnt have made a better choice. I was exhausted from an overnight flight and the comfortable bedroom was very quiet and peaceful. Kieran offered good suggestions for hearing traditional pub music and put out a good breakfast as well. The small patio adjacent to the bedroom provided fresh air and a relaxing breeze."
3474511,504786892,8/8/2019,"It was my first time traveling solo out of the country and Kieran made my stay a warm, hospitable experience. Hes a down to earth guy that is easy to get on with. From his helpful tips to the lovely gesture of chocolates and water by your bedside upon arrival, I would highly recommend his place!

Tons of food joints very close by will allow you to eat around the world, and still walk home to your bed. Good transport links too, handy for tram and bus lines, including the airport express bus. Kieran works from home, often late at night, but don't worry, he's neither a road constructor or a drummer so you won't hear a peep from him. If his work load is not too onerous, then he'll be happy to have a cuppa with you and share his deep knowledge of a city he loves, but recognises has its faults e.g high prices and gentrification. He's spot on with pubs, and we strongly suggest you interrogate him about the local music scene. A comfy bed and a more than adequate breakfast complete the deal at this excellent Airbnb."
3474511,560638122,11/7/2019,"Kieran's place was very beautifully done and sparkling clean. It was exactly the same as in pictures.
As mentioned, both the days we woke up to a good continental breakfast. 
Kieran was really warm and welcoming!
Would definitely highly recommend!"
3474511,566037367,11/18/2019,"Stayed at Kierans for my weekend in Dublin, and it was perfect. The place is in the City Centre and is within walking distance of a good amount of the sights. The room was clean and well kept. 

Kieran was extremely friendly and hospitable and had a lot of good recommendations for places to go around the city. Would definitely recommend his place to anyone looking for a clean and affordable stay in Dublin!"
3474511,567020734,11/21/2019,"Great place, well located, clean and safe. Kieran was a fantastic host, he was always available, gave us recommendations of places to visit, eat and drink. 

Totally recommend his place."
3474511,567293241,11/22/2019,"A really nice chap, welcoming and deeply hospitable. Good chat if you want it but perfectly happy to leave you to be if you prefer that too."
3481361,437754930,4/15/2019,The host canceled this reservation 334 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3481361,483178793,7/7/2019,Great house for large groups
3481361,489202817,7/16/2019,"Beautiful, historic townhome in Drumcondra. Lots of rooms. Large living room, kitchen patio and four bedrooms. 

Location is  close enough to all the Dublin sites with short bus/taxis to the town center. Lots of great restaurants and even the largest stadium were walking distance away.

Owner was very hospitable and gave a terrific walk through. My family had a great time!"
3481361,490257990,7/18/2019,"Alojamiento cercano al aeropuerto,hay una parada de bus en la puerta( nosotros cogimos un taxi para 8 pot 16‚Ç¨).  Al centro tambien fuimos en taxi por 20‚Ç¨ los 8. La casa es amplia,camas sufivientes paralos 8. No echamos en falta nadamas que el secador,y enseguida el padre de Lorcan no lo trajo. Tanto el menaje de cocina, como sabanas y toallas estan muy usados y desgastados. La casa no esta mal pero le haria falta algo mas de limpieza. Las posibles deficiencias de la casa se suplen por la amabilidad y predisposicionde Lorcan y su padre."
3481361,490660763,7/19/2019,The host canceled this reservation 164 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3481361,496358592,7/27/2019,Lorcan and Joe were very accommodating. Location is great. Not to far out of town but close to lots of restaurants and bars etc. walk to Botanic Gardens and easy bus or walk to city.
3481361,504839026,8/8/2019,Would 100% stay again. Very kind host and great location.
3481361,513960478,8/20/2019,"This is probably the best airbnb I have ever stayed in. The kitchen has a good selection of pots, pans, and utensils. There's a clothesline in the back garden that was incredibly useful. The house was spotlessly clean, enormous, and very comfortable for my party of six. Best of all, theres a bus stop pretty much right outside the house, so it's very easy to get down into Dublin using public transit. If I ever make it back to Ireland again, I hope this place will still be available!"
3481361,515576975,8/23/2019,"The unit was very clean and had plenty of rooms to accommodate my family.  Good location to nearby bus lines.  
I flew in at a very early hour and Lorcan was able to leave me a key so we did not have to wait. This was very helpful."
3481361,520447705,8/30/2019,"great place, great safe location for parking. ideal for what i was looking for, close to all amenities,  trains buses etc, pubs and restaurants."
3495749,419072320,3/3/2019,"Really good location in frequent bus route and taxi back from temple bar was only ‚Ç¨14. Everything clean and tidy, would recommend!"
3495749,420971885,3/8/2019,Great place! Would stay again.
3495749,424839155,3/17/2019,Great place to stay!
3495749,425449317,3/18/2019,Isa was a great host!  It wasnt too far from the city center and it was easy to find!
3495749,427991971,3/24/2019,Good price for the apartment. Fine for a weekend trip.
3495749,433317549,4/6/2019,What a cute place right near the Guinness storehouse! We had an easy checkin and parking right in front of the building. I would definitely recommend staying here!
3495749,433952644,4/7/2019,Good place and responsive host. A bit out of the city center and quite small if you are 5 and have lots of luggage.
3495749,438622178,4/17/2019,Great location!  I was pretty much 30 minutes away (walking) from all the places I wanted to see.  The bus stop is literally out front and was pretty easy to use and navigate...after a bit lol.  Very friendly greeting from Isla's daughter upon arrival...3 hours late.  My plane got delayed and it was still a pleasant arrival.   Would definitely recommend!!
3495749,440127671,4/20/2019,"Easy check in, easy check out. Easy walk to the tram. Had a great stay."
3495749,445461470,4/29/2019,"Convenient location, a Tesco nearby, good transport links (and walkable to the city centre as long as you don't have too much luggage!!), excellent communication with the host before and during our stay - and a lovely apartment!  All good :)"
3495749,451271686,5/11/2019,"The appartment was okay. It was nearby the tram station and it was very quiet. We had all what we need, check in and communication was very good."
3495749,452533211,5/13/2019,Very nice place with a very good host!
3495749,455154944,5/19/2019,Isa does a good job! Good communication and provides everything necessary. This unit is close to light rail (red line) that takes you right to the center of Dublin. Its inexpensive and easy to ride with all day and weekly passes available.
3495749,457481696,5/24/2019,It was nice place
3495749,459318004,5/27/2019,Isa's place in Dublin is perfect for staying close enough to the city that everything is accessable but also outside of the bustle of the downtown. The apartment was sparkling clean and there were all kinds of configurable beds for any sort of stay. 5 stars all across the board!
3495749,468415062,6/12/2019,"Great place in Dublin, only a 30 minute walk from the Guinness Storehouse, or if you dont want to walk its a really short drive. The nearby area is less touristy so you can expect cheaper food prices compared in and around Temple Bar Area. The place is nice and comfortable and was perfectly clean when we arrived."
3495749,469277987,6/14/2019,"Isas flat was spotlessly clean and well equipped. Bed was very comfortable. We were allowed to check in early by isas daughter which was much appreciated. A little  distance from city centre but very close to tram stop. Great stay, thank you."
3495749,474702074,6/23/2019,Good location and easy to find.
3495749,483259728,7/7/2019,Perfect for a weekend stay
3495749,496332866,7/27/2019,Clean and comfortable
3495749,499920560,8/1/2019,Amazingly clean place located near a bus stop. Easy check-in and very easy to find.
3495749,514973854,8/22/2019,"Highly recommended, will be coming back"
3495749,519294354,8/28/2019,"Great location, it was easy to get around Dublin! Check in was nice and easy."
3495749,532791609,9/20/2019,"The place is nice, clean and has everything you need.  It is located in a good spot to be able get wherever you want in Dublin."
3495749,533225552,9/21/2019,"Very clean apartment conveniently located, check in experience was easy and host was quick to reply to messages. Would recommend and use again."
3495749,535347935,9/24/2019,Great stopover aftera long flight before beginning our ireland tour. Had everything you need and super clean. Great host who let us in early for a nap after our flight.
3495749,536175430,9/26/2019,"Isas place is ideal for anyone staying in Dublin. Close to the city itself (less than a 30 min walk, and a bus stop is less than a minute from her place), and the ability to privately park is an amazing value."
3495749,538918071,9/30/2019,"Good value for entire flat, clean and comfortable.
The location of the flat is handy for transfer to the city centre, however I wouldn't recommend bringing children or those of a nervous disposition as the locals can be a bit intimidating"
3495749,540780744,10/4/2019,"Isa is the worst host I've ever dealt with. She was unresponsive, didn't honor our agreement, gives out the wrong phone number that a guy named Jonathan answered and it apparently happens a lot because he tried giving out a different phone number for her that doesn't exist. She ruined my vacation to Ireland, WOULDN'T RECOMMEND!"
3495749,542385539,10/6/2019,"Cute apartment and perfect for spending the day touring. Several taxi drivers did mention we are in a rough area, especially after dark. We kept that in the back of heads, but really had no issues. Overall, this place is close to a lot with public transport within 10 mins walk."
3495749,550742401,10/19/2019,"The apartment was just as shown in the pictures. Its small but has everything you need, and the heaters were very efficient - important in the chilly weather! We heard only minimal noise from neighbors and it was otherwise quiet. Isa was very flexible with us, letting us check in early after a morning flight arrival, which we really appreciated. Free, on site parking is a great benefit in the city location. Everything you want to see in Dublin is easily accessible!"
3495749,551551570,10/20/2019,Matches the pictures exactly and was completely fine but you may be able to hear people in other flats if they're being particularly noisy - I personally didn't but my friend said they did. Great communication from Isa as well! Easy to find and perfect if you just need somewhere to rest your head for a night
3495749,555857739,10/28/2019,"Appartamento piccolo ma con tutto il necessario 
A poche fermate del bus dal centro 
Direi ok"
3495749,558899402,11/3/2019,Clean place. Isa responded quickly if I had any questions.
3495749,560966893,11/8/2019,Okay place for short stay. Thanks for your kind hospitality
3529607,421403492,3/9/2019,"A comfortable ground floor apt. Big bed and a futon, both very comfortable. Heater works great. Amenities are very nice and the neighborhood is nice too. A comfortable place to crash for a night or two."
3529607,427238160,3/23/2019,Would highly recommend to a friend
3529607,436600550,4/13/2019,"The location was what we expected and was convenient for our stay.  There were not towels provided the first day which was a big inconvenience.  

For anyone looking for a space to accommodate more than two people, DO NOT book this place.  The listing says it can handle six people and has four beds.  It really has one smallish bed, a futon, and two chairs.  It might comfortably accommodate 2-3 people."
3529607,437861213,4/15/2019,"I would not recommend this place especially for the price she charges. The heater didnt work. It smelled like something died because water was sitting in the washer and smellled awful. I paid $133 for a place that I thought would be cozy but it was uncomfortable and to expensive for the tiny space. Isa is very sweet as a person so this has nothing to do with her as a person. Just, if you have to stay there and absolutely dont have any other option then maybe consider it. Just a fair warning though..."
3529607,457097589,5/23/2019,"A nice little flat close to public transport, a tesco and some good take away food."
3529607,457981411,5/25/2019,Isa was helpful and quick to respond. Very handy to have free parking in Dublin as this often has an added cost. Handy location. Thanks
3529607,459371059,5/27/2019,"Niet geheel geschikt voor 6 personen; kleine badkamer, weinig ruimte aan eetbar. Echter wel genoeg slaapplaatsen. Slaapplek moet opgeborgen worden als men gebruik wil maken van de slaapbank om op te zitten. Prijs/kwaliteitverhouding is goed."
3529607,460479758,5/29/2019,Good value. Free parking a plus.
3529607,460837312,5/30/2019,Smaller than expected.
3529607,462616529,6/2/2019,Broken window just inside front door makes the place feel rundown.  We parked where Isa suggested in front (off street) but another renter in the building said that was illegal.
3529607,464308578,6/5/2019,Would recommend- thanks!
3529607,467968420,6/11/2019,Lovely comfortable apartment. Very handy for visiting the Guinness Storehouse and a nice quiet area. The owner's communication is fantastic
3529607,469349183,6/14/2019,"A perfectly nice place.... City trip as couple for 3 nights . Suited our needs, well-priced, we didn't spend much time at all at the apartment, but used it as a base for exploring Dublin. We bought the DoDublin 72h transportation card and loved how easy it was to take a bus into town and spare our feet the extra mile it would have taken to walk. Not fancy, nothing crazy, just a nice place to be. I read some reviews about the smell, it certainly had a musty feeling, but it didn't bother us at all (I can't stand too much perfume)..."
3529607,476530917,6/26/2019,Spent two nights while visiting Dublin. Was a good place to lay our heads at night. If youll be in Dublin for a short trip and just need a place to go to and from it will get the job done. Most things accessible by foot but called a cab for a couple!
3529607,478977423,6/30/2019,"Serviceable, cute flat in the Rialto neighborhood of Dublin. We were using it as a one night stay in between arriving in Dublin and heading to County Clare. Walking distance from the Heuston train station, we walked on arrival and took a taxi on departure as we had heavy packs. We didnt have hardly anytime for this particular stay, but it was an easy walk to St. Patricks Cathedral so we were able to do just a little bit of sightseeing. Quiet at night and clean."
3529607,482218018,7/6/2019,Clean & tidy close to the city centre but in a quiet location
3529607,487847920,7/14/2019,"The apartment was very small but slept 5 of us including fold down sofas. It was clean. There was parking at the front which was a bonus for us. The location was pretty handy- 5 minute walk to the tram stop, a bus stop right outside the door. Is a brisk 10-15 minute walk to the Guiness Storehouse"
3529607,496441914,7/27/2019,"We ( family of 4 adults) stayed for one evening on a travel lay over. Isa's place was a good value. It's not fancy, but solid and clean. We were quite comfortable. We made the half hour walk to the Grafton St. Area. There appeared to be good access to the public transport to get into more tourist spots without walking."
3529607,498061361,7/29/2019,Clean and central. Walking distance to downtown.
3529607,500577529,8/2/2019,Dublin is ridiculously expensive. Surely something will have to give soon.
3529607,502896072,8/5/2019,"Central to city. Convenient.
Would suit 4 people vs 5."
3529607,506092672,8/10/2019,We were happy with the apartment. Thanks Isa for all information that you provided and for your responsiveness.
3529607,508185521,8/12/2019,"This apartment is perfect for a short stay to explore Dublin. Its in the up and coming Dolphins Barn area with convenience stores a 5 minute walk away. Bus stop to the City centre is right outside and the tram stop is a short walk away. Small, modern property which is safe and secure. No frills but would highly recommend."
3529607,511344813,8/17/2019,The flat is secure with parking and in good proximity to bus stop and city.
3529607,514049053,8/20/2019,"Better bedding ie: pillows / covers bit dated. 

The hand towel rail in the bathroom fell off onto my bare toe, no serious damage done but was painful. It was only then I noticed it was been held together with cello-tape. 

Bed comfort : 6.5/10
Sofa bed: 4/10 
Two single sofa beds :2/10 but I could personally sleep on them. 

The host was very informative & the apartment was very clean. Great location with parking behind gates."
3529607,524543050,9/6/2019,Very good
3529607,525113531,9/7/2019,"This was a fine place to stay for one night, but it was not very comfortable at all. There were also very loud people in the building, which isn't really in their control, but it was still annoying. It smelled very damp inside and just generally felt not so great to stay there. It was nice because it was easy to get to and close to the Guinness Storehouse (and surrounding things)."
3529607,526037230,9/8/2019,We loved it !
3529607,531729606,9/18/2019,"Posizione un po periferica ma fermata autobus subito fuori casa. Ampio parcheggio privato nel giardinetto antistante. Spazi curati e puliti, wifi gratuita e persino adattatori per le prese della corrente europee.
Soddisfattissimo."
3529607,533317131,9/21/2019,"Lovely place, very close to the tram. Bit small but perfectly cozy, wonderful place to be if youre visiting Dublin."
3529607,533887721,9/22/2019,"Isa's place is well-situated, close to transport links in the city. Straightforward and streamlined check-in, with very fast replies to any queries. A simple set-up, but plenty of space, and the main sofa-bed is huge."
3529607,536805304,9/27/2019,"The apartment was very clean, spacious, and had good internet connectivity."
3529607,538769032,9/30/2019,"Good location, nice amenities"
3529607,540872056,10/4/2019,"Clean, warm, and good location for tram to city centre."
3529607,543271475,10/7/2019,"Very basic, the location saves it."
3529607,544998227,10/11/2019,Recommended. Easy travel by tram or 40 minute walk to city centre.
3529607,546092223,10/13/2019,Cosy flat with plenty of beds for you and your squad. Buses to town stop right at the front gate.
3529607,549490612,10/18/2019,"Very good communications, reliable, easy. Accommodation is decent, 5 minutes to tram stop, 40 minute walk to Parnell Street so commute into the centre is manageable.
I would use this apartment again."
3540733,419977422,3/5/2019,"Gerry was really nice. He welcomed us, showed us the apartment and gave us a few tips to make our trip better and easier. Would highly recommend, even though it may seem like the apartment is a bit far away, but its totally worth it plus the bus line number 16 takes you directly from the apartment to the airport and viceversa. We had a wonderful time!"
3540733,421013890,3/8/2019,"Very nice place, you get what you pay, supermarkets near and bus to the city centre 5*"
3540733,434734551,4/8/2019,Fit what we needed-he gave us excellent tips on parking and what was in the area.
3540733,441883597,4/22/2019,"Great place for 1-2 people, Gerry had great directions to the place and good local tips."
3540733,445433650,4/29/2019,"Great location, excellent public transit connections to all over Dublin. Nice space, and excellently supplied kitchen. Highly recommended."
3540733,455223738,5/19/2019,"Nice little place, minutes from DHC shul."
3540733,463521164,6/3/2019,Great place! Perfect location! Easy to navigate! Comfortable little flat perfect for a week trip!
3540733,466555026,6/9/2019,"Great location, Gerry replied back quickly and the place was very clean. I would stay there again 100%. Bus stops were super close and the neighborhood had everything we needed."
3540733,471909187,6/18/2019,"Gerry's place is great! It's only five minutes from the bus stop and Gerry gave really detailed instructions on how to use transit to get to the flat, which was super helpful. The neighbourhood is absolutely lovely. Small amount of noise from the neighbours, but nothing out of the ordinary, and overnight was quiet."
3540733,476544905,6/26/2019,"The quality of the room is enough to stay alone. I don't recommend this room for a couple. The price is reasonable, but Dublin downtown is far from the place."
3540733,486185575,7/12/2019,"The apartment is comfortable and near enough to downtown  to easily navigate. Gerry was always quick to respond, and we got some great local tips and useful information. The neighborhood was quiet and picturesque, and the apartment itself is perfectly comfortable."
3540733,490196369,7/18/2019,"First of all Dublin and Ireland as a whole we enjoyed immensely. It is beautiful, charming, quaint, and vibrant all at once. Gerry's flat is out of the city a block away from the bus into downtown. There are awesome restaurants closeby. Definitely check out the The Lovely Food Company. The shower was hot and torrential. There is a washer and dryer on site. The bed was comfortable as well. My wife and I would stay here again for sure."
3540733,495033068,7/25/2019,"Lovely location! One bus ride to city center and the restaurants nearby have amazing food and coffee! The walls are a bit thin, so just keep that in mind, but it's otherwise a great stay!"
3550489,486927854,7/13/2019,Nice place.
3552721,418111890,3/1/2019,"The room is very well located and Lina was a very nice host, helped us with everything we needed!"
3552721,432009540,4/2/2019,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3552721,527675706,9/11/2019,We had a really bad time with Lina... but thanks to Airbnb we could leave the place and find something better. Thanks to the costumer service from Airbnb ‚ô•Ô∏è we would never ever recommend Lina.
3552721,546189507,10/13/2019,"The room was clean and ready to use. Easy to check-in and out with no problem. I would recommend people to stay as long as it is a couple, not three people. There are two rooms available and some of the pictures may be from the room you don't stay in. Keeping in mind it was a really small space it was clean, it is in a really great location especially for anyone that wants be close or plans on moving around the city by public transport since it is a 10 minute walk to Heuston station and a 5 minute walk to the tram stop that takes you to Connolly train station. Buses at the bottom of the street run really often too. Again, the stay was great and the place was quiet and clean but I just a heads up on the size of the space if three people are booking the space. Even though with its size the room is fully equipped which comes in really handy.
Lina was really quick and clear with instructions and answer any questions which made everything really easy."
3576358,484148234,7/8/2019,Very nice house with good proximity to public transport
3576358,494929469,7/25/2019,"Christina is a great host, she responded to my messages quickly and she met us at the property and welcomed us. We enjoyed staying there and everything was nearby."
3576358,503663777,8/6/2019,"Christina was very helpful with check in, answering questions and responding to us. Unfortunately all of the mattresses were uncomfortable and the bathrooms didnt meet our cleanliness expectations. Overall, not what we had hoped for."
3579644,421928941,3/10/2019,"The environment of the house is clean, so you have feeling that you are in a park. It is not so closed to the center, but if you search for dynamic days and relaxing nights, that is the place. It is not such a big deal to travel to the center. And the feeling that you are at home, and have private relation, is remarkable."
3579644,426835545,3/22/2019,"Caroline and John are the best host you can get! Caroline is very welcoming and John always give good advises. The room was VERY clean and comfortable.

3579644,428498931,3/25/2019,"We got a great night's sleep here! The beds were so comfy, the shower was clean and refreshing, and  the home was welcoming. Our hosts, John and Caroline, were helpful and a delight to chat with! Of all the Airbnbs I've stayed at this has been the most welcoming and overall the best experience I've had so far. The location is a bit out of the city of Dublin but it is close to a bus line that brings you straight to the city centre(30 min ride). John also offered to bring us to the airport for a fee and it was a great extra service they provided to us. They truly went above and beyond to make our holiday stress free. I highly recommend staying here!"

We really would recommend this place! And we would like to come again "
3581384,445945690,4/30/2019,"Christina's townhome is a spacious home with all the amenities one needs. We (two adults and 3 kids) stayed for 3 months and loved it! The kitchen is fully equipped and has everything you need. There is a washer and a dishwasher too which is really nice if you prepare meals at home. We also ordered food from local restaurants close by - they either delivered or we picked up. There are small convenience stores close by and a few pharmacies. Grocery stores are also 15-20 minutes walk or a few bus stops away. 
There are three bathrooms and we really loved this - especially having 2 showers. Christina even arranged for the cleaning company and the linen company to come and pick up linens and towels regularly even though we were staying fairly long term. That helped us a lot since we did not have to worry about washing and drying the towels and sheets. Everything was in great working order and if we needed anything Christina and John were on it right away and fixed a few small issues that came up. The location was great for us because there are at least 6 bus lines one minute away from the place, and all the buses take you straight to the center of the city. We were also glad to be near the workout park and LUAS. We are so happy to have found this place and Christina and John who were amazing hosts! We highly recommend staying at their place."
3581384,467520593,6/10/2019,"Christina was a great host.  She communicated with us beforehand and was there ready to let us in and show us around. The house was clean, and she added special touches for us.  Overall, the house is a great value.  It fit our family well and was a quick cab/bus ride to the city center.  I would highly recommend this place to future travelers."
3581384,470442883,6/16/2019,"The place is new and clean. There are no curtains in the master bedroom where it gets light very early in the summer time. The bed in the master bedroom is a full size mattress and not very comfortable. The loft upstairs was nice and is perfect for a teen. The bathrooms were adequate. Bring some towels.
The place is off the beaten path but it doesnt take too long to get places downtown."
3581384,480753234,7/3/2019,Christina was a fantastic host! It was so nice to be greeted by her when we first arrived and to be shown how everything worked. It was close to MANY bus stops which was super handy. Parking was great and the space was large enough for 5 of us plus a toddler. A wonderful place to stay when in Dublin!!

3581384,512186872,8/18/2019,"The house is a three-bed roomed house with two bathrooms and another downstairs toilet. which is extremely hard to find and helpful when adults are sharing.
The location is a bus or taxi ride from the centre, but both options are easy as the property is near a main road and a hospital. Also if you need to travel in Ireland it is close to the M50 and other motorway routes out of Dublin.
The house is well decorated with comfortable beds. The kitchen was the only area which we felt needed improvement due to a lack of cutlery which is why we are only giving 4 stars. Despite this there is a washing machine/tumble drier, dishwasher and microwave oven as well as an electric oven and hob which we used during our stay.
Our host was friendly and helpful with any requests we had and we enjoyed our stay in this property."

Fortunately, we were able to give the hospital as a landmark, but the first time from the airport, had to take two cab drivers to get to the destination. Overall, the place had all the amenities we needed and was very clean. It was loud at night from other neighbors which was a little frustrating since we chose the place away from Downtown Dublin. Check-in was a little stressful since we were traveling internationally and didn't get WiFi always and was not made aware of the check-in instructions until the day of."
3591840,493994728,7/23/2019,Great communication with the host made checking in easy. Access to on site parking was a great bonus. Great location. Apartment was clean and up to date. Would highly recommend!

3591840,503554280,8/6/2019,Isas place was great! We stayed here for our first night in Dublin and check in was a breeze. We walked to the Guinness Store House and it was no more than 15mins. Very clean location and Isa is always ready to respond. Thanks for the awesome stay Isa!
3591840,505563377,8/9/2019,First stay in Dublin for us. The appartement of Isa was a perfect place for our family : quiet and well situated. Next Time we wont hesitate to come back
3591840,506354541,8/10/2019,"Very clean apartment, and also the building itself! Everything was very nice and Isa answered timely on any questions we may have had."
3591840,507183163,8/11/2019,We enjoy staying at this Place
3591840,511272148,8/17/2019,Isas place was exactly as described. A great place to stay while in Dublin.

3591840,515069521,8/22/2019,"Very clean, good parking facility, close to bars and clubs 9 Euro taxi. Very happy thank you"
3591840,516429354,8/24/2019,"Nice stay in Dublin, especially if you need free parking space. You can take the bus to the centre from the bus stop in front of the house, which was very handy."
3591840,517425292,8/25/2019,Lieux propre mais lointains des transports et du centre villes
3591840,521098521,8/31/2019,"This was a great little spot for me, my mom, and grandmother. The apartment is small, but its Europe, and it has everything that you need. It would be a bit tight for seven people, but still doable, plus the whole reason for traveling is to explore, not sit in an apartment. It was clean and comfortable. The building was secure and there are little shops, pubs, and restaurants nearby. The bus stop is right out front and you can get anywhere in the city easily. Do yourself a favor and get some fish and chips from Gino's Takeaway, just down the street. I would stay here again if visiting Dublin."
3591840,524109346,9/5/2019,"Was a good place, not to noisy, handy information"
3591840,529869402,9/15/2019,"Little appartment not far from Guinness House (15minutes by foot).
Beds are confortables. It was not possible to lock the bathroom door, the appartment is not really soundproof and some cooking tools are missing in the kitchen . The direction information were correct and clear and answers for our questions were quickly answered. For a place to sleep in Dublin its ok."
3591840,534104417,9/22/2019,"Good place. Close to the tram, but in a bit of a rough area- although we had no issues with it, we did not leave anything in our car overnight just in case. Would stay here again, because the price is good. But the price is good for a reason."
3591840,535859814,9/25/2019,"Good, clean accommodation and perfect host - Thanks"
3591840,537189109,9/28/2019,The place is very nice and has a great host! The location is a 30 min walk from the city center and can be tough during the cold rainy season. We used public transportation most of the time.
3591840,538113707,9/29/2019,Great location! Walking distance to Guinness factory and Jameson on bow street. Lots of restaurants in walking distance as well. There was free off street parking available which was a plus. The apartment was clean and suited our needs which was only to sleep close to airport and local attractions.
3591840,539834804,10/2/2019,A lovely cosy place thats very central to the city. The beds are comfortable. Overall a really great stay. Would recommend this home.
3591840,554358220,10/26/2019,"cozy apartment, everything was fine"
3591840,556392695,10/29/2019,"The apartment was very clean. However, the bathroom door did not close/lock. The beds were mattresses/box springs on the floor and were beyond uncomfortable. The springs in the mattress were broken, therefore, the bed wrapped around you like a cocoon. The neighbor cooked something nasty 24/7 and the smell leaked into the apartment. The fold out beds in the front room have stained mattresses. The washer appears to be only hooked up to hot water so our clothes shrunk. There was 3 of us staying at the Airbnb for 3 nights and only 3 towels were available. I actually contemplated finding a hotel but due to the marathon and festivals, they were booked and expensive."
3591840,558775854,11/3/2019,"Great weekend in Dublin, staying at Isa's place. It is very convenient and super clean! Perfect for a weekend in town."
3592153,425483137,3/18/2019,"The house is amazing, in a great spot and a walkable distance from the city centre with great local amenities.  We didn't get to use the garden much as the weather was a bit wet and windy but it was nice to come back to a warm house after being out in the cold. St. Patrick's Day was fantastic and we all had a memorable visit to Dublin made all the better because of the accommodation."
3592153,431038881,3/31/2019,Great local vibe in a great area!
3592153,440195331,4/20/2019,"This is an incredible home that you will be so happy that you rented. We walked to the city center, relaxed in the house and enjoyed every thing Dublin has to offer. 
Conor has thought of everything and anything you could need and he is available to answer your questions or concerns.
The house is beautiful and in a  gorgeous posh neighborhood about a block from the American embassy. 
Schedule your visit and enjoy!"
3592153,442372077,4/23/2019,Conor was very easy to communicate with and made every effort to provide the Make-A-Wish Family with everything they needed for a comfortable stay.  Thank you!
3592153,444651724,4/28/2019,Great spot. Perfect location and easy communication. Nice sun room. It worked well for our family get away!
3592153,449352301,5/6/2019,"Conors house is a great place situated in a lovely area of Dublin. With a bakery & one of the best Indian restaurants around the corner, plus lots of other shops, bars & restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 
The house is a warm & inviting space with one of the largest & most comfortable beds Ive ever slept on! It was a lovely space for the 8 members of our family to stay. Although unfortunately we didnt get to meet Conor,  he was always really friendly, polite & quick to reply when messaging. 
I would have no hesitation in recommending Conor & his house."
3592153,451766352,5/12/2019,"Conor's house in Balldbridge is a stylish & luxurious home, whose spacious bedrooms and living areas allow guests to feel as though they have their own space - even when staying with a group. 

The outside terrace is a sun trap. We got a sunny day on our trip and were able to spend lots of time outside. 

The kitchen/dining area is the perfect space for relaxing and socialising with your group. The bedrooms are large and spacious, with lots of space for storing suitcases/hanging clothes. The beds were clean and comfortable to sleep in. 

Unlike other airbnbs I have stayed in, this house feels as though you are staying in someone's home. 

The location has everything you want - a shop across the road, and in an area with endless amounts of popular bars and restaurants."
3592153,461826520,6/1/2019,"25 Ballsbridge is a quintessential Irish home away from home. The amenities and proximity to sights is great. Despite being near the financial district, stadium, and active roadways - it was very quiet in the house AND  the private courtyard. Conor is an attentive host but not overbearing, quick to respond and informative. He helped to make our trip to Dublin a success. I highly recommend this location for anyone traveling to Dublin.."
3592153,498842061,7/30/2019,"25 Ballbridge Terrace is a great family location - close to Dublin proper, easily accessed by bus and tram.  Conor's hospitality and flexibility was superb."
3592153,533964752,9/22/2019,"This is the perfect spot to experience Irish warmth. The rooms are ample and traditional yet all of the modern amenities are available. Our host was thoughtful, informative and left some unexpected welcome gifts! The home could not be more beautiful, it will suit every taste. staying at the home wouldve been a holiday in itself if we had never even stepped outside!!"
3592153,547897806,10/16/2019,Amazing place to stay would stay there again
3592153,548268768,10/17/2019,Very helpful and responsive. Great property.

3592153,568326985,11/24/2019,"Conors place was such a great space. It was a convenient distance to the town centre and had all the amentities you need within walking distance. The house was lovely, spacious and clean and Conor made us all feel very welcome and at home. I would highly recommend Connors place if you are looking to stay in Dublin!"
3592455,419604003,3/4/2019,"The apartment is amazing, the neighborhood very quiet and the host is perfect."

3592455,436560807,4/13/2019,Great location! Super easy to get to from the airport. 2min walk to st Stephens green and the trams to the downtown area. Lovely space for a family. Super cute coffee shop just around the corner as well. Highly recommend:)
3592455,442440072,4/23/2019,"Location, location,location. It is so central and yet tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Anne you have a gem of a place."
3592455,449196366,5/6/2019,Great location and very spacious apartment. Walking distance to shopping area and major attractions. Large bedrooms and quiet. We enjoyed our stay here very much!
3592455,457584741,5/24/2019,"This air bnb is in a perfect spot to explore Dublin city center. Getting to the actual apartment was super easy as well as an airport shuttle stops about 1 minute from the apartment. 

Anne was fantastic! She responded promptly to any message we had sent. Check in and check out was easy and she helped to make our travel stress free by allowing us to drop off/leave our luggage before/after check in and check out. We had a small issue when we arrived which she resolved quickly.

We would stay again."
3592455,460849076,5/30/2019,Best located appartement and great communication with Anne.
3592455,464715645,6/6/2019,The location of the Airbnb was superb! Very close to everything. The apartment was very clean and cozy. We had an excellent stay and would gladly stay again.
3592455,471907679,6/18/2019,Anne's place is wonderful! Very roomy and clean. We had no problems and she was there to greet us when we arrived. We did struggle with keeping hot water in the shower but I know other reviews will warn you of the same thing. It is a great location and we loved walking through the St. Stephen's Green everyday.
3592455,480285946,7/2/2019,Amazing location near St. Stephens Green
3592455,482244077,7/6/2019,The location is great but the apartment is not so good. Expect ants and a strong smell of humidity.
3592455,487848989,7/14/2019,"This apartment in Dublin is in the best location ever. It is a city that is more than worth visiting and if you wish to be central, Annes apartment is perfect. It was quiet, clean and good value."
3592455,499450148,7/31/2019,Good location but not luxury: it is in need of attention to bring it up to a reasonable standard.
3592455,502201074,8/4/2019,Great location!
3592455,504281902,8/7/2019,"Anne's apartment is amazingly located for exploring Dunlin, with almost everything in waking distance. As a young family, we felt safe and secure both at the apartment and in the surrounding area. It was also larger than I expected, with some staples provided that was very helpful for new arrivals. An excellent choice for your Dublin adventure. Thank you Anne!"
3592455,508769013,8/13/2019,"Roomy and modern apartment. Superb location, really close to St Stephens Green but very quiet. Great for a short or long stay close to Dublin hotspots."
3592455,511491010,8/17/2019,We had a great stay at the appartment. Especially the location was perfect! Close to St Stephen's Green Park with a playground. Thanks to Anne a good supermarket was quickly found. The only disadvantage for us was the lack of a reasonable amount of daylight and fresh air.
3592455,514464914,8/21/2019,"Reviews said this place was sparkling clean, but the apartment could really use a deep clean. The radiator in the main bathroom leaked onto most of the bathroom floor, and it was annoying to keep emptying the bowl every few hours to stop it from happening again. Also, there is no heavy curtain on the main window, and as the apartment is on the ground floor, that was an issue when a garbage truck came by, nearly right up to window, around 10:30pm and 11:30pm one night. The location by St. Stephens Green was great and the host was very responsive when explaining the hot water heater switch by Airbnb app (in small closet by main room- takes 30 minutes to heat up), but I would not stay here again for the price and three-day minimum."
3592455,520383670,8/30/2019,"Beautiful house, located in a very good position, very good for visiting Dublin."
3592455,524226437,9/5/2019,"This apartment is in a perfect location for what we needed, walking around downtown Dublin. It was close to bus stops, lots of pubs and restaurants.  Grafton Street and Temple Bar are all within an easy walking distance. We felt safe in the neighbourhood. However I would not describe it as luxury. There are some cleaning and maintenance issues that need to be addressed. It would be nice if there was a coffee pot, of any sort. Instant coffee is gross."
3592455,530092320,9/15/2019,Great place in a lovely location. Host was very friendly and greeted us on arrival with milk/bread which was very thoughtful. Perfect location to get into the centre while also nice and quiet.
3592455,531724326,9/18/2019,"Location, location, location! Right off St. Stephen's Green so a great jumpoff place for all the best of Dublin. The place was fine with a well-appointed kitchen and some goodies on hand, lots of room. good beds, good shower but you need to turn the hot water heater on before you use it. We had a bulb blow in one of the bathrooms where it was the only light and despite communication with the host about it, it was never replaced. Also, the listing indicated washer and dryer but no so. Would not have known if we had not seen other reviews. But host did leave addresses of two local laundries. Despite those glitches, definitely recommended."
3592455,535441555,9/24/2019,"Great location, large flat, wonderful host and great price."
3592455,558076822,11/2/2019,"Anne's flat is in a great location, around the corner from St Stephen's Green.  It is a clean, secure, warm flat in a great location.  Anne was very kind and left us a welcome pack which was great.  The flat is a little tired but with decoration and an additional comfy chair the place would be great."
3592455,559961158,11/5/2019,"Excellent location very central to everything but very quiet at night so perfect. Could do with a bit of a make over, very tired looking. The beds werent great you could feel the springs and pillows very old and worn. Only managed for two out of a party of five to shower and then the water went cold. Emailed Anne and she explained if we were to put a switch down on the boiler and wait 15 mins we could get more hot water? Why we werent told this I dont know and having to wait 15 mins at a time for individual showers was ridiculous when there is 5 people waiting! This really put a dampener on our sons 21st birthday weekend away! When we arrived also all the radiators had been turned off apart from the lounge and the bathroom so it was freezing in there. Luckily we managed to turn them on after the second day. The fridge was unclean and had half empty bits of food and half a bottle of drank Pepsi in it! A bit of a make over, new beds, new pillows and duvets, a new boiler and a major clean of this apartment and I might consider staying again but until then its a no from me!!"
3604420,434055982,4/7/2019,"With a cosy coal fire on a cold April evening this was just heaven for me. 
Everything in this boat hits the correct mark. Highly recommend this to anyone with even the slightest since of adventure -brilliant"

I highly recommend this unique experience."

3604420,532797366,9/20/2019,"Fabulous location, coffee shop, supermarket, restaurants and bars a stroll away. 
Trish was extremely responsive to any questions we had. A pleasure to communicate with.
The boat itself was such a fun place to stay. Had everything we needed and, oh my, the water view for morning coffee!"
3604420,534135701,9/22/2019,Great experience. Live on the canal. What a unique and great stay. Ill be back for sure. And Trish is a great Host. No issues at all. Enjoy!
3604420,539442264,10/1/2019,"The barge was such an amazing and unique way to visit Dublin! The space was very comfortable and good sized. It was very cozy during one day with torrential downpour and cool temperatures. The bed was great and the seating out of the bedroom over the canal was incredible. Its hard to find a private place to stay in a city, this was exactly that. 

To top it all off Trish was absolutely the best, extrodinarily responsive and helpful. Five stars for sure!"
3604420,542207532,10/6/2019,Great place and very Safe !!
3604420,546919711,10/14/2019,"This stay was the highlight of all my trips around the world, it's unique, adorable and so much fun. The barge was so delightful, Trish had the fire lit for when we arrived which was really lovely. I cannot recommend this stay highly enough."
3604420,558748195,11/3/2019,"The barge is in an amazing location for adventuring in Dublin and you couldn't ask for a cozier, cleaner, more interesting living experience. The pre check in video provided all of the information necessary and Trish was available whenever necessary. Highly recommend!"

3627473,430804395,3/31/2019,"Richard and Kevin managed to make me feel welcome even before entering their flat! Communication was spot-on and loads of tips provided, i.e. super detailed direction to the flat  even before I had a chance to ask  Welcome was friendly, we had a nice chat, flat is very nicely decorated, really bright, amazing terrace, fully equipped kitchen, spacious bathroom and HUGE bedroom, with very comfy bed and lovely smelling bedsheets! Attention to detail (make-up towel!!), breakfast adapted to my diet, good tips on restaurants, pubs and activities, 5 mins walk away from Trinity College but yet quiet enough to have a restful sleep! Would recommend this flat to everyone and will definately book it again for my next trip to Dublin!"
3627473,431936876,4/2/2019,"Richards home was warm and welcoming, with such incredible personal touches, and his fantastic communication from start to end made it effortless to find. He gave great suggestions for things to see and do and had resources galore at the ready. Great private room, very comfy bed, wonderful home with lots of natural light nestled a short walk to so many key spots in the city. I had a fantastic stay - only wish it had been for longer."
3627473,433948230,4/7/2019,"Richard and Kevin out did themselves with brilliant pre arrival info and tips on transport link.

3627473,471270609,6/17/2019,"If you stay with Richard expect a very clean room and bathroom to yourself/ves. The shared living space and kitchen are also clean and open although if you are like us you will be out and about enjoying the best of Dublin right at Richard's doorsteps. The breakfast was great and fresh. We were offered great tips, clear communication, and historical insight into the recent gentrification of Dublin's inner-city."
3627473,474572171,6/23/2019,"Richard is a special person and host. The space lives up to its name about being homelike. He went the extra mile in being helpful. The place is very central, close to Trinity, train stations  and Temple Bar"

3627473,519898715,8/29/2019,"This private room/bathroom in a 2-bedroom apartment is centrally located, walking distance to everything, comfortable and stylish. There is a lovely outdoor balcony where the hosts set up breakfast - including oatmeal, Irish brown bread, yogurt and fruit and just about anything else you could ask for - which made for excellent people-watching. The bedroom is comfortable with space for working with the bathroom right across the hall. The space is light and Kevin offered numerous suggestions on where to eat and walk. All in all, a great choice for your trip to Dublin!"
3627473,523687788,9/4/2019,"Richard and Kevin are super nice hosts. The apartment is very comfortable, there's everything you need and you can really feel there like at home. I highly recommend  it! :)"

3627473,528622410,9/13/2019,Richard and Kevin were very friendly and communicated well. They provided local tips for bars in the area that had live music that wouldn't be too touristy. They set up a wonderful breakfast spread in the morning as well. We would highly recommend staying with them if you are visiting Dublin.
3627473,530747254,9/16/2019,"Stayed at Richard and Kevins for two days before I started on a 12 day adventure tour around Ireland. As a tourist, I appreciated the location as it was a convenient walk to most of the attractions in Dublin. They set out a lovely breakfast in the morning which you get to enjoy on the balcony. I am glad that I chose this place and would recommend it for others."

Richard and Kevin made me feel really comfortable since the first moment. The room + bathroom have everything you need,  both spotlessly clean and the comfy bed is absolutely the best part. I was really surprised on how quiet the room is and how easy it is to relax in there. Kudos for the makeup towel, such a smart touch, something that all places should have and think about!
Thank you for this amazing stay, would definitely recommend it to all guests and hope to come back one day!"

3627473,549486187,10/18/2019,"This is a great base to explore Dublin as the location is very central yet it's located outside of the busy streets, so it's very quiet. The flat is modern and the breakfast was a great way to start the day."
3627473,553158034,10/23/2019,Richard and Kevin were amazing hosts and made our stay in Dublin a great experience.

3634410,470439691,6/16/2019,Cathys place is wonderful. It had everything we needed and was a nice warm place to come home to for our stay in Dublin. Thank you so much for letting us stay with you Cathy.
3634410,478641302,6/30/2019,"Cathy was very responsive and the home is in a great location. The issue was cleanliness. The fridge had spoiled milk and food, the dishwasher had dishes in it and the rubbish bag under sink was full. Bathrooms had rubbish and the sink cups were dirty with some mold, soap dispenser in one bathroom was broken. I mentioned the cleanliness to the owner as I wasnt sure if it was left from a previous guest or not, the response was that she lived there. It was a gated area which was good and cute courtyard."
3634410,493211459,7/22/2019,"Cathys place is in an excellent, secure location in Dublin, within walking distance great pubs, parks and local attractions. My son and I stayed there a few days and found the space to be everything we needed. Cathy communicated well and was a pleasure to deal with."
3634410,525932141,9/8/2019,"If you arent already aware, this house is the owners full time home so as such her personal items are in the house. Whilst at first this did feel slightly like I was an intruder in her home, the house and garden really is beautiful and once I got past my initial feeling I absolutely loved it. Beds are super comfy, and the house is furnished beautifully. 
Check in and out was really easy, even though we werent arriving until very late at night. Cathy was really helpful and answered all messages immediately. 
So if you are looking for something a little different to your standard hotel or sparse Airbnb, I would thoroughly recommend Cathys place. 
Note: Oil Can Harrys just round the corner has live music at weekends and is a great bar."
3634993,471292221,6/17/2019,"This is a beautiful house in a very quiet area. It is well located, short 15 minute walks to most of the popular tourist destinations we visited. My son and I loved going for a 5 mile run along the grand canal just a couple blocks away. Giustina's sister was very helpful meeting us on arrival and helping us get situated in the house. We received lots of helpful tips for stores close by and restaurants to eat at. We had everything we had hoped for and much more during our stay. Thank you for hosting us!"
3634993,534150869,9/22/2019,This place is amazing if you want to get away from hotels and live in a beautiful well cared for home. We felt like we were at home with comfortable beds and great living spaces. I would book again without question!

3644687,488590625,7/15/2019,Verona's place is very cosy. Verona is very kind and will help you with places who you wanted to visit. Her place is close by the bus station and the local supermarket.

3665546,451217112,5/11/2019,Cute place! Great location. A little loud at night but thats the price you pay to be so central to downtown. Sabrina was very communicative and friendly. I recommend this place!

3665546,468748953,6/13/2019,"Sabrinas place definitely exceeded expectations! I wasnt sure what to expect really, but the location was fantastic! Very close to many major attractions but not right in the middle of all the noise. The only downside was that sometimes the seagulls can get a bit noisy outside the window, so if you plan to sleep in and are a light sleeper you may want to bring some earplugs. Great apartment!"
3665546,472708361,6/20/2019,"We loved Sabrina's apartment . It was the perfect location for our trip to Dublin . So close to everything and just a quick walk from airport bus to the apartment . The apartment had everything we needed for our stay .

3665546,481690394,7/5/2019,"Sabrinas apartment was a perfect location from which to explore Dublin city center. It was absolutely sparkling clean, very comfortable, and well-equipped. Sabrina was very responsive throughout. All the main attractions I wanted to see were within 15 minutes walk, and many were within just 5 minutes or so. There are loads of coffee shops and restaurants just nearby. The one drawback is that the immediate neighborhood is not particularly attractive, but as a woman traveling alone, I did feel safe nonetheless. For the convenient location, value, and cleanliness, this is a great option in central Dublin."
3665546,484010770,7/8/2019,"Really enjoyed our stay at Sabrinas place, the location is perfect and easy to access everything in the city centre. The place was very clean and spacious. Would recommend."
3665546,485629816,7/11/2019,"Great location, very clean and secure and the host gave us clear and accurate information.

Sabrina made check-in very easy. Everything you want when using this service. 

A decent kitchen with a cook top and oven. And a small fridge for essentials (but why cook - too many good places to eat very close by). 

Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The weather was warm and a bit humid, but the fan provided kept the flat cool.

The lift was out of order our last day, but the stairs are easily accessed and not difficult to manage. 

Overall a very pleasant experience."
3665546,486286193,7/12/2019,"Super location: close to lots of restaurants and shopping and nightlife, but not so close that the bar crowds are an inconvenience. Clean, comfortable, functional city apartment."
3665546,487729392,7/14/2019,"The apartment is exactly as shown on the pictures. Excellent location, few minutes walking away from the Temple Bar and all the main attractions. Lots of restaurants and markets near by. The building has a elevator, which is very good for those with lot of luggages or people with difficulty with stairs, like our case. The apartment is cozy and very comfortable, including the sofa-bed on the living room. Sabrina was always available. I would definitely stay here again on a next visit to Dublin and recommend Sabrina¬¥s apartment."

3665546,510055508,8/15/2019,"This place is convenient, within walking distance to major attractions and public transport to/from airport and ferry. While in a back alley, it has the benefit of being relatively quiet. The host provides a decent list of supplies., especially food related. Overall, we are happy with our stay."
3665546,512518170,8/18/2019,"Sabrinas apartment was great, as shown in pictures, and in a perfect location. It was clean and check-in instructions were clear and simple. However, equipment was basic, and the double bed was not very big, enough for two medium sized people. 
Would definately recommend it for a short stay in Dublin."

3665546,534838781,9/23/2019,"Sabrina's place was in a wonderful location right down the street from temple bar and the heart of Dublin. If you are lucky enough to book this home you will have a great time! We did have an issue getting the hot water heater started up, but Sabrina responded so quick and resolved our issue. 10/10 place and a 10/10 experience."
3665546,535821387,9/25/2019,"Apartment location is amazing! Its close to many tourist places. Sabrina provides thorough instructions on how to reach her place either via public transportation or car. Theres a parking garage right across the street from the apartment. Her apartment is also very stylish, I could imagine just living there. The sofa bed is a little worn but if youre staying for only 1-2 nights its not a problem at all."
3665546,536266693,9/26/2019,Awesome location near many bars and sights.

3665546,540912506,10/4/2019,This is a great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of the city.  There isnt a view but if getting into the city is what you're looking for this will do it.
3665546,547455687,10/15/2019,Perfect little apartment in the absolute best location possible when staying in Dublin. A quick 3 min walk to the city center let us make the most of our short stay. Sabrina was more than accommodating and her apartment was so clean and comfortable!

3665546,559994294,11/5/2019,"Perfect location close to Temple Bar, quick responses and lots of information provided for finding the apartment and checking in, will definitely stay here again"
3665546,561353687,11/9/2019,"Unfortunately Sabrinas place did not work well for us.  We didnt have hot water 2 out of the 4 days we were their.  We would leave early and come back late and their must be some type of timer that turns off the water heater.  Despite following the instructions it never worked for us.  In addition the place needs a good thorough clean, it was very dusty.  Many of the amenities were rusted or had holes in them, kitchen items were dirty.  The walls are very thin, so if the neighbors are loud it can be disruptive.  The location is definitely the best thing about the apartment.  Checkin was also very easy.  If you want the best location and the other stuff doesnt bother you then it might work for you, for us it didnt."
3671756,447944150,5/4/2019,"I've stayed for 3 months at Yvonne's place and I can tell you that you will be perfectly received ! The room is pretty small but you have access to the rest of the house at any time and can use all the facilities. Yvonne is super friendly, she will often invite you to some trips (and even offer you some of her food or pastries) and Oscair is a super cute and well behaved doggo. I felt completely free and at home at Yvonne's, don't hesitate !"
3671756,465725892,6/8/2019,"Yvonne is really kind and caring person. Rio (my dog) and I had a lovely time staying with  Yvonne and Oscar (Yvonne's dog). It felt as if I am living at my own home, she has helped me with with transportation, grocery shopping,local tip and looking after my dog. I will highly recommend her place and Yovnne as a host."
3671756,543296110,10/7/2019,"I can't rate Yvonne highly enough. I had a wonderful time staying with her, and she was the perfect host, instantly making me feel at home, and going out of her way to help me settle in. The area is safe and quiet and well-connected to town, and Yvonne was really helpful in explaining the various bus stops and routes. A really perfect introduction to Dublin, and I hope we stay in touch!"

3698469,426242479,3/20/2019,"Our stay with Tony & Cathy was absolutely wonderful. They are such wonderful people and we enjoyed visiting with them so much. Tonys humor always had us laughing and they were both full of great, local tips and places to visit. Some of our favorite parts of the trip were from their suggestions!
Their home is lovely and a perfect location with a quick 10 minute walk to the train and local transport or easy parking if you have a car also. Breakfast was a quick perfect start for the day and appreciated a lot! The space was very comfortable, cozy and clean, and gave the true Ireland feel. Id recommend it to anyone and cant wait to return! Cheers!"
3698469,434694443,4/8/2019,Tony and Cathy were warm and welcomingîreally pleasant to talk to. Both were happy to answer my questions and offer great tips on activities to do. The breakfast Tony serves is top notch. The location is a nice mix of easy access to Dublin (via the Dart) and easy beach accessîroom was also clean and comfortable.
3698469,435424853,4/10/2019,"My stay at Anthony's place was quite short but very lovely. He kindly offered me a lift from the train station when I arrived and provided some great tips on local restaurants and sights. The location is so nice - only a 10-15 minute walk to the beautiful Killiney Beach and rail station and my room was very clean and well stocked with any necessities I could want. He even provided a USB port/phone charger, which was helpful as mine had broken the night before my arrival. My stay was far too short this time but I definitely recommend this sweet little spot and hope to come back someday!"
3698469,442388277,4/23/2019,Tony was a fabulous host. Great fun and very witty! We enjoyed all the jokes. He and Cathy were so welcoming and made us feel very comfortable. Really appreciated the added tasty bites over Easter too! Tony is a mine of information for points of interest locally and further afield. Barney the dog was also great and a wonderful singer! We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this place to stay.
3698469,457049757,5/23/2019,"Absolutely fantastic hosts and a great location to explore Dublin from. Plenty of street space to park -if youre driving, and walking distance to the Dart -if using train. Their house is a hidden gem in Dublin; a small cottage feel, with all the modern amenities you want. Dont hesitate to get advice on where to go, as they know the city in-and-out. 

This Airbnb offers the amenities, safety and space of much more expensive options, at an affordable price. Also, if you love dogs, their dog, Barney, is calm and super friendly!"
3698469,459429396,5/27/2019,"Really beautiful house in a really beautiful location. 
Anthony is a generous host with great hospitality. He prepares breakfast with his self-baked bread - Awesome! He has alotta good tips and advices and we had really deep talkings, as well. His wife was rare cause of her work shifts, his daughter had great advises, as well. 
Trainstation is nearby, also other shops and take-aways. Really quiet place and really good location to start to Wicklow National Park. You are not in the Center of Dublin but in a good place to start over to all the good places in and around the city. Car to city center: 25-30min, train (DART) 35min+footwalk (10-15). Really highly recommended accomodation!!"
3698469,466347335,6/9/2019,"This delightful gem south of Dublin's city center is a hidden gem. The highlight of our trip was our host, Tony, who availed us with fun stories and quick wit, delicious breakfast (including his homemade peanut butter), and recommendations for local attractions (including Joyce's tower and Killiney Hill Park). We also loved spending time with Barney, Tony's sweet cocker spaniel."
3698469,469878808,6/15/2019,"We stayed at Anthonys and Cathys place on our short stay in Ireland. Anthonys communication was great in the lead up to booking the room and he even came to collect us from the coach drop off in Killiney as we arrived late evening. The room was ideal for our purposes and he even made up a camp bed for my teenage daughter who I was travelling with. The shared bathroom (with the other room occupants) was lovely and clean and had everything needed. Anthony and Cathys breakfast was a nice touch, yogurts, coffee , juices and homemade bread was gorgeous in the mornings. 

We were in Ireland for a concert in Malahide (1 hour away by train) but Killiney was an ideal base, just outside Dublin on the coast in a beautiful neighbourhood with good transport links  to everywhere. Killiney itself is definitely worth a walk around, especially up to the top of the hill passing a few local celebrity homes along the way. Also Dalkey the next Village over is also worth a visit. 

Myself and teenage daughter had a lovely stay at this AirBNB and would recommend Anthony and his wife Cathys hospitality to anyone."
3698469,471261258,6/17/2019,"The hosts really make you feel at home! Tony and his family will help you with everything you need, for example tips for daytrips or very good restaurants. Moreover we enjoyed the selfmade bread every morning and the nice converations. We will definitely come again!"
3698469,473905414,6/22/2019,"Anthony is a very pleasant host, friendly and interesting. The accommodation is absolutely lovely and the house has real character. Wifi and communication with host both excellent!"
3698469,483080152,7/7/2019,"My friend and I stayed here for a weekend vacation to Dublin, and it was an absolutely amazing experience! Anthony was very accommodating and gave great instructions on how to get to Killiney. The scenery in the area is incredible and there's so much within walking distance! The train ride to Dublin city center is only about 30-45 minutes, and a Leap card can get you unlimited rides on the train and buses. Anthony also gave fantastic tips about what to do in the area and in the city, and we loved chatting with him over breakfast! Overall, we loved our experience and would love to go back again!"

Very clean, great mattress, and even greater breakfast. Cathy and Anthony always offered a lift to the train to shorten my travel time into Dublin. I will miss cute and cuddly Barney the family dog."
3698469,543735412,10/8/2019,Tonys house felt like our temporary home. We felt welcomed and taken care of. Tonys delicious breakfast rekindled my love of sofa bread. We are already looking forward to our return trip. Thank you!
3703959,425456601,3/18/2019,A clean and welcoming environment. Anton goes over and above what is required. He was helpful and kind the entire time. Accomodating and professional
3703959,437181586,4/14/2019,"Anton was a really great host, who went out of his way to make sure everything was comfortable. He was so considerate about our really late check in (midnight). He kept the fridge stocked and the place was exceptionally clean. He is also friendly and helpful with advice about what to see and how to get there. The place is really good value and I would stay here again when back in Dublin. Thanks Anton!"

They helped us with local tips, offered complementary food and were great companions when we came home from a day of exploring Dublin. We will recommend Anton's air b and b to anyone traveling to Dublin Ireland! Thanks again Anton and co "
3703959,478079331,6/29/2019,Brother and I stayed over June 2019. Anton and his housemate Christof were both very friendly and full of tips and information about the locale. Very laid back and relaxed. Nice flat in central neighborhood in the north of the city. 15min walk to O'Connell st.
3703959,493396002,7/22/2019,It's been a great stay at Anton & Christoph's. They have been very helpful and forthcoming in all terms.
3703959,498126227,7/29/2019,"The best option is to call Anton just before you would enter in the lodgement for the first time. The entrance is a common entrance, several private lodgements had the same entrance and could be a little bit confusing for the very first time, that is all."
3723817,462506869,6/2/2019,"Very cozy and spacious house with very easy access to the city center. We had a great stay and would recommend a stay at Laura's to anyone, especially cat lovers! Best regards, Ken"

3728903,445993996,4/30/2019,Linda was very welcoming and the bed was very very comfortable! Walking distance to the train and the shops.
3728903,447881417,5/4/2019,Linda & her daughter were great hosts with a beautiful place. They have a beautiful kitten too. I would say allow enough time for check in as there are a few things to learn (I had to rush off to a family dinner & this wasn't ideal though Linda was very accomodating). I'd definitely stay again.
3728903,449776952,5/7/2019,"Linda was a great host. I enjoyed my conversations with her, and she made me feel very welcome in her beautiful home. Lindas residence  is conveniently located within walking distance to the train station that takes you into Dublin (5-10 min walk). The train itself is about a 25 minute ride into Dublin city center. I recommend her place if youre a solo traveler interested in exploring the sights and sounds of Dublin, and even Ireland (through tour buses), but would like to put your head down at night a little further away from the hussle and bustle of city life."
3728903,453924839,5/17/2019,Great and reasonable priced!

3728903,473265579,6/21/2019,The place is on the back side of the second building if anyone gets a little lost. A warm home with a furry friend. The patio is a place to be in the morning. Wonderful space!
3728903,477357559,6/28/2019,"There aren't enough stars on the rating system!
The only thing better than the fantastic home is the wonderful host Linda and her daughter Megan.
Please do not book as I want to return"

The B&B is in walking distance from the city center (around 20 minutes) and the bus 16 goes directly from the airport to the accommodation (takes 45 minutes till 1h). Because of a flight delay we had to check in really late and it wasn't a problem at all, also the host is answering any questions or requests within a day. The breakfast is great too :-)"

3735789,438266887,4/16/2019,"We spent some wonderful days in this airbnb. Conj has been a perfect host. The breakfast, accompanied by some warm good-morning-words, gave us the power and the good mood for our daily Dublin adventure. Located in a quiet quarter of Dublin but within reach of the busier parts of the city it was a perfect basis to experience Dublin walking or by bus. Highly recommended!"
3735789,439086734,4/18/2019,"We loved our stay here in Dublin.  We were greeted the first day and shown to our room.  Conj reviewed the room with us, gave us our keys, and saw us on our way to site seeing.  Our accommodations were perfect!  We had a room to accommodate 3 of us with our own bathroom, very comfortable beds.  It was clean, the perfect location, and we really enjoyed our breakfast each morning.  Very healthy meal of breakfast cereals, fruit, ham, jam, cheese, toast and bread.  We had lovely conversations with our host who recommended sites of interest.  We would love to return and would definitely stay here again.  Thank  you for a lovely place to stay!!!"

The location is perfect, 20 mn walking from the city center."
3735789,459397171,5/27/2019,"We had a room in the main building (next to the building with breakfast). The room was beautiful! Very spacious for 3 people with lots of natural light. The bathroom was also larger than other places we stayed in Ireland, had a skylight, and the toilet flushed well. Decent water pressure with enough hot water for 3 back to back showers. The room had plenty of towels, a hair dryer, adapter, and a tea kettle with coffee and tea packets (plus milk and sugars). There were also maps of Dublin, the bus schedule, and other information packets available downstairs. They were great at accommodating late check ins and let us drop our bags off early. The hosts were very nice! Breakfast included toast, cheddar, deli ham, mini babybel cheese, and soda bread. There was also tea/coffee and an assortment of cereals and jams. We were very happy with our stay!"
3735789,461259452,5/31/2019,Comfortable place that is very close to the city. Great place for exploring the city. Overall it was a great little place

The room is just the right size for what we needed. Breakfast was delicious (babybel cheese!) and Conj was a pleasure to chat with. 

We were about 15 min walk from City Centre. We enjoyed Grafton Street and found delicious food in Dublin."
3735789,470670406,6/16/2019,"Overall a really good stay. Good value room in a really good location, you can take the 16 bus from airport to door and Temple bar area is 30 minute walk or 10-15 by bus.  The area also feels very safe. Breakfast kept us going and the lady serving was very friendly. Only drawbacks are you can't use appliances like straighteners or tongs but they do provide a good hairdryer. Ensuite is good but no soundproofing, wasn't much of a problem unless of you want to use the toilet in the middle of the night while others sleep :)  very easy check in and check out process and quick comms (one  note is the listing looks like it switched times so check out is 11am not 12pm and vice versa for check in which does make more sense and is till generous compred to other places)"
3735789,472354262,6/19/2019,Was a lovely stay. The host took care of us very well and was very friendly the whole time. Offered us an earlier breakfast than usual when she found out our departure was earlier than the normal breakfast time. I would definitely stay here again!

3735789,496206555,7/27/2019,"Communication with Conj was polite, easy and swift.
We were greeted and let in personally.

We liked the location very much. It is just a short walk to pubs, parks, shops and the city center. The room itself is a bit tiny if you are travelling with three persons, but it worked well. It has to be said, that you should consider bringing your ear plugs, because the wooden ceilings of these old buildings transport sound of others quite well.

I recommend this particular room to guests who are very familiar with each other, because there is some sort of open ""window"" above the door between bathrom and bedroom, which cannot be closed and therefore makes it difficult to maintain some privacy inside the bathroom."
3735789,507250606,8/11/2019,"The room was cozy, and on the first floor. The small garden in front of the house was just outside our window which was nice. Good location on a quiet street."

Host allowed us to drop bags at 7am, which was nice because we landed at 5am and could not check in until 12:30.  Beds were comfortable.  Host was not very friendly or outgoing.  Didnt like answering questions. Asked her about breakfast end time and she just pointed to a sign that I didnt see instead of just saying, 9 am.ù Rooms were very warm but I didnt dare ask how to turn off the heat. Breakfast was simple, cereal, juice, toast, and ham. Plenty for me, but may not be so for others.  Rooms are a bit noisy to each other, but no street noise, so that was great. Overall, average stay, good price, simple accommodation."

We highly recommend getting the Leap card transit 1-week visitor pass ($40 euro).  Recommend getting the pass on line before you go they will mail it to you. There is also regional trains that can get you to almost and part of Ireland. One day we took Day trip to Cork. The ride was nice and you got to see a lot on the ride.

3789686,558681714,11/3/2019,"Veronica is a fantastic host, she couldnt have been more welcoming. The room is lovely and the bed very comfortable. The location is great for the Bord Gais theatre and very easy to get into town and to and from the airport."
3789686,560268070,11/6/2019,Pleasant and extremely convenient. Veronicas warm welcome was a greatly appreciated plus. I recommend.
3789686,560959095,11/8/2019,"Veronica was very welcoming and communicative, and the room had everything I needed."
3789686,562689504,11/11/2019,Not worth the price as compared to the other places we stayed at. The place was in a good location but was extremely tiny and felt crowded. Pictures online were misleading. Just seemed like the owners storage space which we lived in. Cupboards still contained the owners shoes etc and a huge cupboard taking up alot of space in the room which was locked. Everything was basic. If u just need a bed at a high price then this is for u. The common areas didnt feel like so as U get the feeling the owner does not want u there. U get sent from the door directly to the tiny room on arrival. Quite disappointing. Good location is what u pay for perhaps..
3791526,419578527,3/4/2019,Dermot and Helen were wonderful in preperation for the trip and met us at the apartment to explain everything and give us suggestions for our stay. The apartment was very clean and we felt very save during our stay. Within no time you are in the city and there is a grocery store very close to the apartment. It was a wonderful place to stay.
3791526,422522290,3/11/2019,"I loved this place.  It was the perfect space for four people.  It was in a good location, not right in the middle of the main tourist area, but close enough and quiet.  There are great restaurants in the area, and a grocery store close by.  There were also nice touches like shampoo and conditioner already in the apartment.  Really enjoyed my time here!"
3791526,422815813,3/12/2019,The host canceled this reservation 177 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3791526,425926026,3/19/2019,Great place and location. Coffee and breakfast is close. The place is clean and secure behind a gate.
3791526,428948764,3/26/2019,Dermot & Helen were really nice and helpful with all our questions. The apartment ist very close to the Temple Bar. The apartment was very clean and a supermarket is right around the corner. If you stay in Dublin for a couple of days it¬¥s the perfect place to stay as you also have a parking spot.
3791526,431647401,4/1/2019,"We had a fantastic stay at this so charming apartment.
The host was very attentive and made check-in so easy and convenient for us, in spite of the delay of our flight and then the traffic jam to the apartment. He was waiting for us patiently and with a kind smile, he explained everything about the house to us, and gave us some tips for sightseeing. 
The apartment was very cozy. The living-room was fantastic, with large windows and a door to a little private zone in the garden. The electric fireplace gave the room a nice atmosphere and was lovely to look at when we were resting at the sofa at night.
The kitchen was fully equipped, and the bathroom was good too.
The two bedrooms were cozy, and the beds were very comfortable.
We felt very much at home, and we didn't like to leave: we would have stayed longer!
The gated development in which the apartment was located was very quiet. As for the neighboorhood, it was very quiet too. You get to the river bank in 1 minute, and there is a SPAR supermarket round the corner. In 15 minutes walking you arrive to Trinity College and city centre. Location was perfect!
And the host allowed us a free late check-out, as no other guest was entering on that day. That made everything easier for us!
We hope to come back to Dublin, and if so, we won't doubt to choose this apartment!"
3791526,435087901,4/9/2019,"I had a lovely time at Dermot and Helens apartment. It is nicely located just a 10 minute walk from downtown Dublin, in a quite part of town. We met Dermot, who was nice enough to let us check in several hours before the set time. When I contacted Dermot he was really fast to answer - for example I asked whether there happened to be an adapter for the power outlet (I had forgotten that we have different contacts in Sweden compared to Ireland..) and he answered right away where I could find a couple. It was overall a really nice experiance staying with Dermot and Helen."
3791526,434992809,4/9/2019,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3791526,438743580,4/17/2019,"Had a wonderful stay at Dermot and Helen's place. The location was fab (just across from the convention centre and around 20mins walk to temple bar) and very close to a supermarket, coffee shops etc. The apartment itself was lovely, very spacious, equipped with everything we needed (and more!), very clean. Communication with the hosts was great, always quick responses and very helpful. Would definitely recommend staying here, we had a great time."
3791526,447942386,5/4/2019,"Staying for a week in Dermot and Helens  flat was a delight. The 2 bedroom flat was spacious and beautifully appointed  and spotless. The outlook over the garden was an added bonus as was the secure parking
Situated just minutes from cafes, pubs and eateries the flat was within a 5minute walk from a very well equipped supermarket.
All the tourist attractions including Trinity College and the Guinness Storehouse were within walking distance as was the shopping district. 
All in all we loved our stay and enjoyed meeting  Dermot who was there to greet us on arrival.

3791526,451953045,5/12/2019,Dermot & Helen's apartment is in a great location and had everything a traveller would need. Dermot is a great host and he came down in the middle of the afternoon to help us check in early. Would stay here again.
3791526,454391260,5/18/2019,"We had a fantastic stay at Helen and Dermot's. Wonderful location, very comfortable space, and an incredibly quiet building, it made for an extremely enjoyable trip to Dublin."
3791526,457071619,5/23/2019,"We had 2 nights in Dermot and Hellens flat and enjoyed every minute of it. The flat is lovely, spotless and well appointed. Walking distance to everything and cafes and supermarket 2 minutes away.  Highly recommend."
3791526,462737022,6/2/2019,"Dermot's place was perfect. Close enough to get to all the spots we wanted to get to, but quiet enough that we slept extremely well. 

Highly recommended. We had no issues at all."

3791526,471322571,6/17/2019,"This adorable 2 bedroom apartment is within walking distance of a ton of great eateries and pubs, and other Dublin attractions. The hosts were wonderful responsive and the place was very clean and well decorated."
3791526,476484926,6/26/2019,This place was clean and tidy with everything you need for a very comfortable stay. I can highly recommend this place for other travellers. It is only a stones throw from the centre of town and many of The great things DUBLIN has to offer.
3795879,421818885,3/10/2019,"In terms of location, you cant get much better than this flat. It is right in the heart of the Temple Bar area with easy access to everything. It is a basic flat but has everything you would need for a short stay. If you are a light sleeper, this might not be the place for you. There is a sitting area right below the bedroom and nearly every night there were loud groups of people that would gather until the early hours of the morning. Roisin was communicative and helpful."
3795879,430880516,3/31/2019,An incredible space with all the basic necessities right in the very center of all the activity. It was so cozy there were times we would just stay in. It does get loud outside but thats how central the location is. Hope to stay again!
3795879,434663936,4/8/2019,"Great place to stay in the Temple Bar area.  Nice, clean, and tidy apartment that was very close to hotel standard.  We enjoyed our stay very much and hope to return some time in the future."
3795879,455132923,5/19/2019,The location of the apartment could not have been better. It was right in the middle of temple bar. The only negatives were the internet was very weak and the apartment occasionally got very hot. Roisin was very responsive to any concerns we had.
3795879,460084771,5/28/2019,"The building was clean and was located in a very convenient location.  It is on a relatively quiet street that is in the middle  of all the things we wanted to do.  Some of the other reviews noted noise at night, but we live in a downtown apartment and found this unit to be relatively quiet for a city location. Although it is in Temple Bar, there are no establishments open late at night in the direct vicinity of the unit.  We stayed with our  adult children and wife and found the unit to be clean and offer ample room."
3795879,467341255,6/10/2019,"Thanks to the Host, for a wonderful stay, the hosts are amazing and the place is just incredible, my family had a really great time staying here. Thanks a lot."

3795879,518330167,8/26/2019,"Roisin and her husband were great hosts! The apartment was conveniently located to tons of great pubs and restaurants. 

Roisin only has one set of keys so plan your activities accordingly. And it is fairly noisy outside and inside (thin walls, yay screaming kids), so if youre a light sleeper bring ear plugs.

All in all she was very helpful for any quick travel tips and made mine and my Dads stay very comfortable!"
3795879,523727739,9/4/2019,This place was central to temple bar and the night life was amazing! Stay out till all hours and close walk home and very secure and safe! Recommended to anyone for this is a great location and shower and bath is great! Stairs abit steep if you arent user to walking up and down stairs all the time but we were only there to sleep most the time so it was ideal for us! Toilet and shower etc on the same floor as the bedrooms which was good to! Would advise this place to anyone whos thinking of partying and nightlife! X
3795879,527156846,9/10/2019,The apartment was in a great location and easily walkable to all major sites and night life. Roisin was quick to respond to messages and very helpful. We also rented a car on our last day and the access to parking was an added bonus.
3795879,531727367,9/18/2019,"Excellent location, few minutes from Temple Bar. Everything is in walkable distance (museums, shops, restaurants). 
The apartment has everything you need and is sparkling clean. A bit noisy in the weekend nights, but you can sleep well."
3795879,539382050,10/1/2019,"The apartment was in a great location, completely new renovated, super clean and fully equipped. At the check in everything was very well explained and support was offered whenever needed. Highly recommended place!"
3795879,543196630,10/7/2019,"We had an amazing time in Dublin and that was partly due to the great apartment. The host was amazingly quick to respond and the check in  process was very smooth. The  location of this centrally located apartment was close to the typical spots which tourists wish to see in Dublin. As others  have mentioned, since this apartment is located in the popular hotspot of the temple bar region, it can tend to get loud in the late evenings as people are leaving the bars. So please be aware of that. The noise Is not unbearable, but it can be loud much like typical city sounds."
3795879,552280596,10/21/2019,A great place that is centrally located. We found it easy to walk to most of the main Dublin attractions. The rental is spacious and we enjoyed having a kitchen. As others have mentioned it is in the Temple Bar area and it can get noisy at night.
3818101,483199010,7/7/2019,"Yvonne and Alan were amazing and interesting to talk to, and the room is perfect. Its a short bus or rail from downtown dublin, and is located in a lovely suburb. The room was sparkling clean and fully equipped with towels, shampoo, coffee/tea, water, and anything else we might need. We had dinner at the pub down the road which was delicious and then Yvonne made us a lovely breakfast which we enjoyed in the backyard. They even drove us into Dublin the next day, which was above and beyond our expectations. Everyone should stay here if they can! It was a highlight of our trip."
3818101,492182226,7/21/2019,"Alan was an amazing host and the place was absolutely lovely! One of the best hospitality I've experienced among all the Airbnb places I've been to.

My friend and I checked in late at night due to a train delay but Alan greeted us warmly along with his dog and his cat. The room is upstairs with a small ensuite bathroom - all very clean and well kept. Breakfast was also absolutely amazing (everything was set out so nicely as well)! The bus stop is very close by from which there are quite a few buses connecting to the city centre. Would absolutely recommend."
3818101,502151552,8/4/2019,"We had a lovely stay in Clontarf. The location was far enough from the city center to be nice and quiet, but was only a short walk to the bus or Dart to Dublin. Alan was a fabulous host and even went above and beyond to drop us into the city. I highly recommend a stay with Yvonne and Alan- you will not be sorry!"
3818101,507120344,8/11/2019,"Yvonne & Alan are wonderful hosts, so helpful and accommodating, made our trip to Dublin better than expected!"
3818101,510544293,8/16/2019,"Yvonne and Alan are superb hosts.  We emailed the day before showing up that we probably needed to ensure a Late Arrival with them.  Not too late, but later.  They were very accommodating and gracious.  Their international experiences make them sensitive to exhausted yet determined travelers wringing the most they can from experiencing Ireland.  In other words, they understand.  My daughter and I would recommend them to anyone."
3818101,512432260,8/18/2019,Stayed here the All Ireland weekend with my Dad and it's probably the best air bnb I have stayed in! The house is absolutely stunning and Yvonne and  Alan were amazing hosts! They completely went out of their way to make you feel welcomed. The breakfast that Yvonne prepared was so thoughtful! The pastries and fresh fruit were perfect! Alan even drove my dad and I into the town so that we could get a few drinks before the game! I would highly recommend this place and will definitely stay again when visiting Dublin!
3818101,514601153,8/21/2019,"Yvonne and Alan are terrific hosts.  We truly enjoyed our stay with them (thank you!).   They made the last couple of days  incredibly pleasant, from Yvonnes croissants to Alan's  excellent advice, and the interesting conversations with both.   We were delighted to meet them and appreciate their wonderful home for a couple of days."
3818101,515716670,8/23/2019,"The room is beautiful and has so many thoughtful touches that I really appreciated after a long day of travel. Yvonne and Alan were so warm and welcoming! I loved that it was easy to park at their place and get to the airport in the morning with a rental car, but also easy to grab a cab for a short ride to downtown. I highly recommend."
3818101,521034400,8/31/2019,Great
3818101,521878260,9/1/2019,Yvonne & Alan are great. The room was spotless and filled with amenities of coffee and tea. They have local knowledge and will give you tips on what to do. Don't skip the pastries Yvonne makes for breakfast!
3818101,523349452,9/3/2019,Yvonne and Alan were lovely hosts. The house is great and bedroom/ en-suite was perfect.  Breakfast was amazing with lovely fruit and pastries. It was easy to get into the city with the bus stops only a minute away. I would recommend this place.
3818101,527576087,9/11/2019,A warm welcome and a memorable experience
3818101,529216105,9/14/2019,Excellent homestay amazing stunning home Alan and Yvonne made us feel so welcome  Lisa and Sandra
3818101,534110078,9/22/2019,"A lovely house with lovely people. Location connected with the city centre. High quality of staff bathroom and warm room with biscuits, cafe, chocolate. Breakfast made with love and attention. My best experience."
3818101,535887652,9/25/2019,"We arrived to a lovely friendly welcome from Yvonne to this true haven for weary travellers - so many thoughtful touches including special coffee and tea bags, cookies and chocolates.  Super clean and fragrant with scented sticks, wonderful beds and linens and modern bathroom.  We instantly rated it a high five stars plus.  We had just one nights stay before an early morning departure to the airport and settled into the relaxing and comfortable environment.  Unfortunately noise from planes made it close to impossible to sleep, and unwittingly we had not realised this may be the case being just 20min drive from Dublin Airport.  Im not sure how others have fared with this noise or if it was a one-off situation, but its not a place I could return to, despite it being one of the best Airbnbs Ive ever stayed in."
3818101,537157674,9/28/2019,"Alan and Yvonne's house is located on a quiet street with private parking in a lovely part of North Dublin in an area I know well as I grew went to school and up close by. 

On a short visit home from living in the UAE I arrived late at night and their reception could not have been better. The house is sparking and the room  and bed very comfortable. As for breakfast! Yvonne bake her own pastries so be prepared for a continental breakfast feast of croissants, muffins, waffles, scones and her delicious fruit bowl with local Irish yogurts. 

They mentioned that there might be aircraft noise from arriving aircraft into Dublin airport but for my 3 nights I had the windows open and heard no noise. 

I am a pilot and have operated from Dublin airport over many years and can honestly state that if there was any airport aircraft noise it would be only because of an unusual airport runway change due to strong winds or maintenance of the main arrival runway 28 which is used 90% of the time with arrivals normally coming from the East over the Irish sea by Howth and Ireland's Eye which is about 10 miles north of their house. I would not be concerned with aircraft noise if looking to book with them.

Highly recommended and I will be back."

3818101,551431085,10/20/2019,"Beautiful house in leafy and serene Clontarf. Perfectly situated outside of the city center but close to the seafront. Clean, classy and thoughtful house/ bedroom. Very accommodating with arrival times etc. The breakfast was seriously high class, a wide assortiment to choose from surpassing the level of the so called 4-5 star hotels. Yvonne and Alan are truly fantastic hosts. Will return here again in the future"

3856095,546218742,10/13/2019,"Paula's place is in a great location with Ranelagh and its range of restaurants at your doorstep. The city centre is just a few stops away on the bus or tram and yet it is a quiet street, in a lovely residential area of period properties. The room itself is a bit small but serves its purpose and you have a private bathroom (not ensuite) all to yourself. I would definitely recommend staying with Paula, who is very nice and helpful, and she makes a great cup of tea too."
3856095,553448723,10/24/2019,Great location. Paula was very welcoming. Cup of tea on arrival was very welcome. Lovely breakfast next morning.

3858756,454425831,5/18/2019,"Although this was a nice apartment in a central location, we had no hot water for two of our four days (first and last).  Owner quickly fixed the water heater the first day and the next two days were fine. Then on our last night and morning, we had no hot water (none). Upon review of other renters reviews, I now see this is an ongoing problem. Renter beware. 
Owner did not reply to my check out message/complaint although she was responsive prior to that. 
Great location. Secure building with elevator (3rd floor apartment). Washer/dryer in unit."

3879473,453595886,5/16/2019,"Angelina was truly the best AirBnB Host I have encountered.  She turned on a dime to help three very weary inconvenienced travelers out.  She was super fast on the response, super helpful in getting us to her place.  Had a sore-throat remedy ready to go when we arrived for one of our party that was ailing.  It was a one-of-a-kind experience!"

3879473,456314666,5/21/2019,"Angelinas a fantastic host, very thoughtful and communicative. This place is perfect if youre looking for a quiet home base just outside the city center that still gives you easy access to the main attractions. This was my first time visiting Dublin and it was nice having a comfortable, quiet place to return to after a day of exploring the city."
3879473,456696862,5/22/2019,Great space and lovely host. Good location and very well priced.

Little touches like breakfast being set up for us when we arrived and cold water in the fridge were lovely. Angelina's place was spotless with everything you need. 5 stars, we hope to stay again soon. Thanks Angelina, from Vicky, Bonnie and Emily. "
3879473,472811578,6/20/2019,Angelina is a thoughtful and kind host. Her place is spotless. As well as breakfast foods she provided little treats for us. It is a little further into Dublin than expected but the half hour bus service is very close by. I would stay again.

Angelina is amazingly warm, hospitable and kind: she offered to make me food if I was hungry; helped me carry in lots of luggage; and let me leave luggage there for many hours the day I left, so it wouldn't be in my car in the city centre. The apartment was spotless; my single bed was very comfortable; Angelina provided breakfast food, sweets, biscuits and drinks. The wifi worked well. I would not only be very happy to stay with her again, I would look forward to seeing her!"
3879473,482309146,7/6/2019,"We stayed in Angelinas home after attending a concert at croke park.  On arrival we were immediately taken back by Angelinas friendliness and warmth. Her home is absolutely spotless with everything you need for a comfortable stay , including milk and bread in the fridge and breakfast ready for the next morning . As well as WiFi and accessories in the bathroom. Well stocked kitchen with tv. Angelina home is 2 mins walk from bus stop into city centre.  We would certainly stay with Angelina again & although we only stayed one night her home is certainly suitable for a longer stay . Thanks again Angelina xx"

3879473,490743954,7/19/2019,Angelina stated that her place is a 10 minute bus ride to the city but this is not accurate at all.  Its more like 45 minutes to the city center and and it took me nearly 2 hours from the train station in rush hour traffic.
3879473,493928886,7/23/2019,"This apartment is close to a tiny village with a few restaurants. There is a bus 15 minutes walk away into city centre. The bus is sporadic on weekends.

Her place is clean and as photographed with some great thoughtful touches - breakfast and tea/coffee/milk all in the kitchen and she offered us use of her lovely garden if we wanted. The house is a little way out from town but easy to get to by bus/taxi and Angelina told us about local shops and pubs a 10 minute walk away. Would definitely stay here again if we come to Dublin.
3879473,498231016,7/29/2019,"This place was an excellent value. Hospitality was very generous. I received some wonderful recommendations for the two sisters pub as well as the orchard inn. It is a bit from downtown Dublin, which is what I wanted For my stay."

3879473,506911191,8/11/2019,Very nice place close to Dublin city center. You can catch the 15 bus about 1/4 of a mile walk up the street which takes you right into town!

3879473,519405572,8/28/2019,Angelinas place is a home away from home in Dublin. Just a bus or taxi ride from the City Centre. Angelinas hospitality was fantastic and she made me feel comfortable and safe. I would absolutely stay here on my next trip to Dublin.

3879473,524523349,9/6/2019,"It was a pleasure to meet and stay in Angelina's apartment. She provided additional touches, milk/cereal/bread,which were so thoughtful. 

Access to city centre requires a small walk to the bus stop and then it's a 15/20 min journey. Ans that's good for Dublin traffic."
3879473,526017470,9/8/2019,"Great host. Great location. Great value. We had a lovely welcome and Angelina went the extra mile to supply Bread, milk, coffee and tea etc. And her cake was amazing. Do yourself a favour and book a stay."
3879473,526658129,9/9/2019,Angelina was very sweet and helpful. The place is clean and comfortable for a solo tourist. The area is quiet and just outside the busy centre.
3879473,528620694,9/13/2019,"It is really easy to get to and from town form Angelinas, just a 30 minute bus journey (recommend getting a leap card). She is so friendly and had bought us some milk, tea bags and breakfast foods, and had baked some apple tarts for our arrival. I felt very safe during my stay and would recommend staying here"

3879473,536202484,9/26/2019,"Spotless, convenient location, friendly host"
3879473,538110645,9/29/2019,"Angelina was friendly and helpful. Answered questions quickly and was happy for a chat but just as happy to let me do my own thing when I wanted. The space was clean, the bedroom was small but had Good storage space and the living area more than made up for it. 
Be aware that travel times can be tripled if travelling in peak hour. And public transport runs far less frequently in the evening, so if your relying on that check the schedule as they stop for the night around 11.30pm."
3879473,541522046,10/5/2019,A quiet residential area with excellent transport links to the city

3879473,547562831,10/15/2019,"The place was clean and Angelina was very helpful with tips and suggestions. The place is a duplex and Angelina lives next door. The front door has a lock but the door to the Airbnb does not have a lock. Thats the only thing I wasnt too crazy about. Other than that, the location was perfect and close to the city center."
3879473,550705798,10/19/2019,Very welcoming; comfy beds; great to have some supplies for breakfast. Useful to have free parking just outside. Useful location for us as we were visiting Rathgar just up the road.
3879473,551453966,10/20/2019,"Huis ligt in een rustige woonwijk, parkeren op het grasveldje voor de deur. Op loopafstand zit gezellige Ierse pub waar je prima kunt eten. Goede bedden, een goed verzorgd ontbijt en een sympathieke gastvrouw maken het een uitstekend overnachtings/verblijfplek. Dicht bij de snelweg; makkelijk voor wie de volgende dag wil doorreizen per auto."
3879473,553071421,10/23/2019,Very well appointed and great communication.
3879473,558613413,11/3/2019,"Angelinas place is spacious and cozy. The house is very close to a bus stop that runs to the city center every 10 minutes. It is a bit of a trip to the city, but the busses run consistently all day. Angelina is the most friendly host that we have stayed with thus far. 

Lauren & Luke"
3879473,561331642,11/9/2019,"This Airbnb surpassed my expectations, Angelina was very welcoming and the Airbnb had great amenities, was spotlessly clean, nice welcome touches and a good location. Great value and would highly recommend to others"

3882631,418990396,3/3/2019,"This is a lovely clean, 1 bedroom mews in a nice part of south Dublin city. I stayed on my own but it is perfect, private place for 2 people. The area is nice with loads of restaurants and bars and is my preference rather than in the city centre. Rosie checked me in at my convenience, responded to queries quickly and when I wanted to check out late and then extend another night, she facilitated with absolutely no fuss.
I would stay again. Thanks Rosie."
3882631,421902740,3/10/2019,"We enjoyed the coach house very much. It was a great home base for our exploration of Dublin with the city centre in walking distance but also good connections on the public transport system and to the airport.
The apartment itself was cosy and felt like a home away from home immediately. Rosie was very helpful upfront, very friendly in person and simply a great host."
3882631,424250295,3/16/2019,"Rosie's place is great: it's clean, stylish, well-equipped and has a great location - almost in the centre, but in a very quite place too. I'd definitely recommend staying here. Thank you, Rosie!"
3882631,426205126,3/20/2019,We had great time! She was so nice to us.Thank you.
3882631,428483107,3/25/2019,"Great location, Rosie is a gem, place is small but really functional."
3882631,431036500,3/31/2019,"Rosie has a lovely home, cozy and perfect for two guests. Its a short walk from the lively area of Ranelagh, with good tram connection to Dublin center. If youre up for walking, you can take a stroll inti Dublin, passing through St. Stephens Green, in about 25 minutes. Highly recommended!"
3882631,437070108,4/14/2019,"Rosie's apartment was perfect! It was tucked away from the street so noise was not an issue whatsoever. A very short walk to the pubs and restaurants of the area, and not much farther to the tram. To get to the city centre by tram does not take long or you can take a nice 20 minute stroll. Inside was very clean and comfortable and had all amenities needed. The hospitality we received was the cherry on top of a lovely stay. I would gladly come back!"
3882631,445470857,4/29/2019,Unbeatable location for Dublin. Warm and accommodating hospitality.  Highest recommendation from seasoned travelers
3882631,449326450,5/6/2019,"Nice cosy coach house, clean and in a good location, 5 mins walk from Ranelagh high street where you can find bars, restaurants, supermarkets and tram that will take you into the city centre in 10 mins. Rosie, the host, responded really quickly to all my messages prior to arrival and lives right next door so is on hand to answer any questions you might have during your stay."
3882631,451783712,5/12/2019,Lovely stay in Ranelagh. Very convenient!
3882631,453288058,5/15/2019,The place was nice.  The location was excellent.  Host was very helpful and easy to contact.
3882631,458549207,5/26/2019,"My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay here.  It's in a lovely neighbourhood and is a nice flat walk to St Stephen's Green and the city centre and only a 5 minute walk to local shops and restaurants in Ranelagh.  It's set down a quiet lane.  Rosie was very friendly and welcoming and helpful, giving us tips on where to visit.  We really appreciated the tea, coffee, milk and variety of breakfast items provided.  It was great not having to go to the shops to buy things in. We treated ourselves to breakfast at Cinnamon in Ranelagh on our last morning.  My daughter says it was the best French toast she has had!   Just a couple of things to note in case they matter to you, both the door and window (non-opening) downstairs are fully frosted, to give privacy from the residents' cars that park up to the building, so you can't see out from inside, other than from the bedroom window upstairs.  Rosie provided hypo-allergenic (ie non-feather) pillows and duvets as I had explained that I have an allergy to feathers but unfortunately the sofa is feather filled and, as it's quite old, a lot of feathers had escaped from it so they triggered my allergies!  Rosie realised during our stay that there were feathers in the sofa and was very apologetic about it.  So maybe best avoided if you suffer from a similar allergy!  The bed linen was lovely and fresh and the beds very comfortable so we slept very well.  The bathroom was nicely tiled and the electric shower was good.  Sealant round the shower could do with a clean and the Venetian blinds and dining chairs dusted (prob my allergies again that detected the dust!) but generally very clean - all the crockery and utensils in the kitchen were spotless.  We bought 3-day Leaps travel cards at the airport for 19 Euros each and found them to be very good value and so handy.  They cover trains, trams and most buses (not the Airport 700 bus which stops just 4 minutes walk from the accommodation but you could take one of the airport buses the card does cover from the airport to the city centre and then switch on to a bus to the accommodation).  I think the card runs from when you first activate (ie use) it rather than from when you buy it so worth picking up at the airport even if you don't need it until the following day.   We especially appreciated Rosie being so helpful when we asked if there would be a possibility of a late check-out.  She was very kind in letting us stay on that day as no-one else was booked in for a couple of days.  If you do need to leave your luggage somewhere there is a left luggage facility at Trinity College (downstairs in the modern glass building - 6 Euros a bag, I think).  It closes for an hour and a quarter over lunch so make sure you can get your bags back when you need to!  Book in advance if you want to visit the jail - it's sold out in advance most days!  Have fun in this friendly city!"
3882631,467880406,6/11/2019,"Bring multiple power (up and down) converters if traveling from states. Short walk to Luas stop, which we found was most affordable transportation to city."
3882631,469798308,6/15/2019,"This place was located in a beautiful neighborhood.  A short walk from the Ranelagh village with charming shops and restaurants.  A nice 30 minute walk to the Dublin City Center that takes you right through St. Stephens Green.  A perfect opportunity to walk off those pints!  Rosie was super helpful with tips, suggestions, and dropping us at car rental agency when we left Dublin.  Oh!  We realized we forgot our passports at the Carriage House and she kindly brought them to us as we waited for our rental to car to head out to the country."
3882631,471829765,6/18/2019,"Rosies place was perfect . Very comfortable & all the boxes checked. Location was perfect, we walked everywhere which no problem. Very clean & spacious , love to stay again."
3882631,473727556,6/22/2019,"We loved this little coach house! It was perfect for the two of us. Rosie was a great host, she gave us step by step directions from the airport, offered local tips, and was just very nice! It was very clean, and had everything we needed. We also really liked that it wasnt right in the city- it was great to go explore during the day and then come back to the quiet little village at night."
3882631,478896605,6/30/2019,Perfect place
3882631,488526314,7/15/2019,"We spent 3 nights in the coach house, had a very pleasant stay here. The house has everything you need and is located very quiet in a nice place. The city is nearby, you can have a nice short walk to St Stephen's Green and all the other attractions there! Rosie was very nice and gave us good advices what to do in Dublin,where to eat , which busses to take! That was very helpful. We had the possibility to stay longer on our check-out-day,which was great for us! Thank you, Rosie, and bye-bye! Greetings from Verena and Lena from Germany"
3882631,492416023,7/21/2019,"The space is beautiful, comfortable, with a mattress you can get a great night's rest on. The location is unbeatable. So close to the LUAS! You can get to the LUAS stop in about 8 minutes if you're walking leisurely and waiting for the lights. The neighborhood is quiet so you'll be able to keep whatever sleep schedule you need, whether that's staying out late and sleeping in till noon or falling into bed at 9 and waking up at 6. 

The bathroom was clean, and exceptionally spacious by European standards! We've lived in flats where I would have killed to have a bathroom as lovely as this one. Getting to have a shower this nice while on vacation in Dublin was such a delight. 

The amenities! I nearly cried because there was already a kettle and tea available. All we had to do was grab milk from SuperValu on the way to the house. I cannot overstate what it means to me that I was able to have tea immediately once we were in the door. There were also plenty of utensils, plates, and some edibles like porridge and biscuits, in case the shops are closed by the time you get to the accommodation. 

Overall, it was a clean, comfortable, considerate, nicely curated, fabulously located place that I would choose again over the hotels in city centre any day. I'm endlessly grateful to Rosie for having such a lovely tucked-away little slice of comfort available for booking."
3882631,508078715,8/12/2019,"Rosies place is literally super! The house is very original and so cute, with the bedroom under the roof. Everything is well organized, lots of services and an exemplary tidiness. Everything is so comfortable that you can feel like at your home. Really recommend! Rosie is a very kind host, quick to answer and helpful for both check in and check out. The neighborhood is great, very quiet day and night, but close to one of the most interesting part of the city, full of shops, pubs and restaurants. The city center isnt so far, I always moved walking, in 30 minutes yes can arrive there, and the walk is really pleasant, being along canal and park. Hope to stay there again!"
3882631,513941646,8/20/2019,Our best Airbnb experience in Ireland.  Rosie and her son were great hosts and made us feel quite welcome.  Ranelagh is a quiet neighborhood with excellent restaurants (recommend Nightmarket for Thai food) and close to bus stops for easy transportation into the city.  The space is beautiful and well put together with nice touches throughout.  Would highly recommend and would certainly stay here again.
3882631,517270804,8/25/2019,"Very beautiful and cozy flat in one of the best areas in Dublin. Lots of restaurants and facilities and you can easily walk to the city center in 20 minutes. The host, Rosie, is really kind. Best Airbnb experience so far!!!"

3882631,543187580,10/7/2019,Great location and very nice & cosy house for two! Good link to the central and to the airport as well. Rosie was a very friendly host and always quickly responded our question and inquiry. Would highly recommend this place!
3882631,546170345,10/13/2019,"Small remodeled coach house. Good for privacy, comfortable and large bed, good bus and tram options. Living area on ground floor felt a bit chilly and had an earthy smell to it, but the apartment was clean and suitable for two people. Nice neighborhood."
3882631,552228344,10/21/2019,Everything good!
3882631,555113401,10/27/2019,"The Coach House is a gem.  The location is amazing, right in a wonderful neighborhood thats a quick 20 min walk from city center or St. Stephens Green.  If this is available, book it as soon as possible.  The beds are comfortable, the wi-fi is great, its clean, comfortable and very private.  There are marvelous restaurants just up the block and your host is the sweetest. Willing to go above and beyond.  If youre thinking about booking it, do yourself a favor and get it done.  You will not regret it."
3902674,484218258,7/8/2019,"Barrys place is at a prefect location for visiting Dublin.  If you take the Airlink express from the airport you can get to the Barrys place without a problem. The location is right at bus stops that will get you anywhere you need in no time at all. With the Do Dublin bus pass we were able to get all around the city from a stop right outside Barrys place. Even the on and off tour bus passes right by the his place. You do not even need a bus to get to the city city center.. its an easy walk. The place is spotless, comfortable, and had everything we needed. They are great host and enjoyed talking with them. Definitely a place we will suggest our friends to stay when they come to Dublin."
3902982,481267343,7/4/2019,"We spent a very enjoyable couple of days at Dee's place, which has great character as it is her own home which she lets out when she is away. Dee's welcome was very warm (as indeed was the Dublin weather!) and she was full of useful tips and suggestions (such as Fumbally, a cafe which is a short walk away and is excellent for brunch). She had also bought a brand-new feather-free quilt for us to avoid allergies, which was greatly appreciated. We enjoyed how bright and airy her home is and also the opportunity to recharge our batteries by sitting in her lovely garden. The city centre is 15-20 mins away on foot, so easily doable. As in much of Dublin, there is audible building work in the neighbourhood; we were aware of it, but it didn't mar our stay and it ceases entirely by late afternoon. We'd certainly happily return."
3902982,484212266,7/8/2019,Dee has a very nice and cozy home. Very friendly and accommodating.
3902982,487618914,7/14/2019,"A lovely and relaxing home, set just outside the bustle of Dublin. Easy to get to the city proper, but located in a more quiet neighborhood.

3931148,426244588,3/20/2019,"Jacqueline's place is close to coastal town Howth, about 20 mins away from Dublin airport. It was the perfect place to stay before our flight back home. Her place is adorned with fun  art work and vibrant colours and other visuals pleasing to the eye. We really appreciated the fully stocked kitchen, breakfast items and extras in the fridge! Beds were comfortable, the towels plush and Howth being so close by for fish and chips, makes this the perfect place to stay!"

3931148,452952951,5/14/2019,Great place that is quiet and away from the downtown fray. Very comfortable and great restaurants in walking distance. Also walking distance to public transportation for super easy access to downtown Dublin. Grocery and pub around the corner as well as the church in case the previous night got out of control .
3931148,460801049,5/30/2019,"Jacquelines place was great. Great location to walk for breakfast/coffee; convenient for train/bus route, centrally located for tourist travel. Abundance of fresh sheets and towels and spacious enough for 7 people. 
We would definitely stay there again when returning."

Nice, quiet area."
3931148,490338887,7/18/2019,"The house is very comfortable and trendy, close to Howth and the coast, and conveniently located to reach Dublin by car, bus or Dart. Comfortable beds and airy and spacious rooms. Nice common spaces (kitchen, living room) to plan visits and relax.  The experience would be top if the host fixes a few annoying details (toilet sink drain was very slow, clothes dryer not working, no toilet brush in main toilet, the back garden somehow neglected)."
3931148,499974864,8/1/2019,Brilliant location to get into Dublin and explore the beau surroundings of north county Dublin.
3931148,501324172,8/3/2019,Very nice house in a calm neighborhood. Convenient place to explore both Howth and the centre of Dublin while just a short drive away from the airport. It was convenient that it was possible to park a car just before the front door.
3931148,506357333,8/10/2019,Wonderful house in a great location with easy access to the city on the Dart and Howth for the sea and lovely walks. Local shops are minutes away.  The house was perfect for our family with three children. Very relaxing. Thank you.

It was very clean nicely appointed and ideally located 20 minutes from Dublin city center, 20 minutes from airport and 5 minutes from the sea. Jacqueline was very easy to communicate with and extremely responsive. We appreciated the extra touches like coffee tea and milk that she left for our enjoyment. I highly recommend staying at Jacqueline's place and enjoying the local area. We had dinner at O'Connell's in Howth and it was excellent."
3931148,510008251,8/15/2019,"Jaqueline has been a great host! Such a comfortable place to stay. We arrived to find a few extras in the fridge and cupboards for us to use.   Natural light in her home, combined with fun decorative touches, make it very relaxing. She makes it easy to use the many items  in her home, and shared good tips on how to get around so we easily accessed both Dublin and Howth.  Restaurants she recommended were great as were the beautiful hikes we could took close by in Howth.  Bonus for us, was easy access to the airport too! Our family of four found it very roomy. Thanks Jacqueline! Would recommend for families or couples. Would stay there again."
3931148,529170949,9/14/2019,"excellent location to travel into Dublin and Howth, very friendly people in the area and a great home to come back to at days end."
3931148,529991943,9/15/2019,Jacquelines house is in a good  location for travelling into the city with great transport links.  She was really quick to respond to our messages.  The house was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  There was ample space for us all.  I would highly recommend this house & Jacqueline is a great host.
3931148,532244097,9/19/2019,Good location. Quiet and private.

3951360,463485486,6/3/2019,"Lovely accomodations, warm and friendly hostess.  Wonderful location close to the sea.  All needs accounted for - wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the accomodations!"
3951360,492536430,7/21/2019,"Isobel's place was amazing! I loved how she had so many separate spaces out back in addition to a lot of common spaces, so different guests could interact as much or as little as they wanted. My group loved her travel suggestions/directions for places to see! I especially loved how close her place was to the beach, so I could still have a place for a run, away from the roads!"
3951360,503055995,8/5/2019,"Isoblel's home was just gorgeous and she is a gracious, kind and personable host. Perfect location if you are heading to the airport the next day...just 20 minutes. The beach and town are within walking distance and the town pub, The Harbour House, is lovely. Best beds and linens in our 13 day stay.  We will be back for sure! Thanks, Isobel!!!"
3951360,509385654,8/14/2019,"Isobel's house is a nice place, close to the beach. On the plis side : the garden is wonderful, the rooms are big, the beds very comfortable with lots of pillows and blankets, there was a travel cot for our baby,and the shower room was nice. We were a little disappointed to get a room (not the bungalow we had  booked). The atmosphere of the house is very special, we perfectly understand that some people love the spirituality of the place and the fact that many people and guests share the house (whether Airbnb or llng-term rent). We are however very down-to-earth and this was not the place we prefered. However this only reflects our own thoughts and once more, we have been nicely welcomed and everything was provided for."
3951360,516411711,8/24/2019,"Isobel is a lovely host. She and her special house with beautiful garden has given us a fantastic holiday. Its nearby the beach for nice walks, you need a car to see all nice things in the area."

3965249,422015267,3/10/2019,"Beautiful place, super peaceful and Isobel was super responsive. My only thing would be that if you are planning to travel into Dublin city center, plan to spend a bit of money..the place was only 20 minutes from the airport but about 30-35 from the city center and we paid 35-50 euros each time we took a taxi. The bus is a lot cheaper, but it takes over an hour to get to the city by bus. Besides that, we loved our stay."
3965249,424227664,3/16/2019,"Isobel is so sweet and cool, very cosy place, overall great experience!"
3965249,428578374,3/25/2019,"We can definitely recommend a stay with Isobel . Great hospitality, fantastic room and garden area. The house is located near beach and shops. If you need a stay in rush this is the place to be!"

3965249,460922991,5/30/2019,"Our visit was brief, however, Isobel was a wonderful host. She was very responsive even when our taxi driver could not find the place in the middle of the night. She woke up and greeted us. The room we stayed in was a bit tight for all 4 of us adults but was comfortable. She made us some tea and biscuits in the morning as well. We woke and walked to the beach in the morning which was less than a 5 minute walk. Would have liked to have enjoyed her lovely back yard, however, it was a rainy, windy day."
3965249,461898696,6/1/2019,"Isobel's home is lovely.  Very cosy and welcoming with a gorgeous garden. A short walk from the main street in Rush and the beach, easy reach of central Dublin and the airport.  A great place to stay if you want a city break with a bit of P&Q at the end of the day or for exploring the east coast. We would definitely stay with Isobel again!"
3965249,462729104,6/2/2019,"Isobel is a warm,  and welcoming host,  with a beautiful home that she allows you to share. She obviously loves living where she does; the accommodation is spacious, clean and with lots of character. The sunroom and garden are a real treat, and easy walking distance to  the shops and the beautiful beaches of Rush.  A real gem in beautiful surroundings which I would highly recommend and would stay again. A great place to recharge your batteries and enjoy the relaxing and safe atmosphere provided by a brilliant host."
3965249,464351376,6/5/2019,"Nice hot shower, drinking water on table upon arrival, getting in was easy, 2 or more pillows per bed and had converter set up in the room, WiFi password written everywhere"
3965249,470454034,6/16/2019,Loved this home and home to go back! Isobel was kind and helpful and the room was great with cozy beds.

Its very restful and beautiful.
Isobels a generous and lovely host. Loved our stay"
3965249,493419198,7/22/2019,"Isobel is a great host. Erverything you need is in her house. The garden is very lovely and a really good place to have a coffee or a drink. 
Almu is very good located, supermarcet, ATM, bus station, beach and pubs,all this is in walking distance. 
I can highly recommend it!"
3965249,506129429,8/10/2019,Isobel is a wonderful host and her house is very comfortable.
3965249,507264689,8/11/2019,"The bedroom is very large, cosy and confortable. We just stay 1 night, but we appreciate the huge and quite beach. The location near the airport from Dublin is perfect to travel."
3965249,510500620,8/16/2019,"Isobel is really nice. The garden and the conservatory are beautiful. But the configuration of the room and access to the bathroom was not very practical for us. Besides, the floor of the higher stage does cracking noises when people walks."
3965249,517442669,8/25/2019,"Such a unique and absolutely stunning home. You can jump a bus or a train to Dublin, or just hang around Rush for quiet and calm. Isobel was a delight and we got to meet her dog briefly!"
3965249,523254418,9/3/2019,"I assure you that you will be amazed with this adorable home - photos just cannot do this place due justice!  If you like plants and greenery and a relaxing environment- look no further!  Our only regret was getting in so late in the evening that we did not have time to soak it in.  Isobel is a wonderful, laid back host - very friendly (as we found most every Irish person we encountered, and welcoming.  What an amazing host and country.  Cannot wait to go back!  Thank you Isobel."
3965249,524623819,9/6/2019,Isobels place is a little haven with vines of grapes growing over your head in the conservatory. A very relaxing space. Looking forward to visiting again.
3965249,527275387,9/10/2019,"Isobels space made for a very nice place to arrive in Ireland. We stayed 2 nights, and got well rested and time adjusted there. The conservatory space was really a delight to sit in. Isobel and other guests in the house were lovely to talk to. Access to the beach was really close. 

Such a treat!"
3965249,531419571,9/17/2019,We choose this delightful spot to catch our flight out of Dublin which is 20 minutes away.  It is very convenient with a grocery store and shops a short walk up the block. Isobel was very helpful and we wish we would have had more time to enjoy her charming amenities.

3965249,533336174,9/21/2019,"A short but very sweet stay at Isobels for a nearby family event.  Comfortable and cosy, her home is in a great location for a walk along the beautiful sandy beach whatever the weather. Isobel (and Rinty!) was very welcoming and extremely accommodating. Thanks again!"

3991589,423206335,3/13/2019,"I would stay with Kirsty again in a heart beat! She is unbelievably friendly, funny, and hospitable. The room you stay in is small but extremely comfortable, that bed with the electric blanket feels amazing to slip into at night. Her whole home is adorable and is such a reflection of her! She really went out of her way to make me feel welcome, but also gave me my space as well. There was a mini fridge with goodies stocked up for me when I arrived, and when I told her I was vegan, the next day she went and bought me vegan ice cream and vegan cheese as well :) She's also extremely helpful and has loads of tips and knowledge of the city. Couldn't be happier with my stay there."
3991589,432269998,4/3/2019,"Kirsty is an excellent host, her home is cozy and comfortable, and the location is very convenient - you can be in the city center within 10-15 minutes. Would definitely stay here again!"

3991589,459433044,5/27/2019,"I loved my stay at Kirstys. Shes a warm, friendly, generous and just a lovely person all around. Tilly and Lefty are adorable dogs. The house is full of character and conveniently located. I would definitely come back for another stay if I find myself in Dublin again."
3991589,463530621,6/3/2019,Kirstey was a very attentive host - wants to make your stay the best it can be. Her place is full of fun. Her place is as described - small and cozy. Not sure if it was mentioned but the bathroom is a ways away from the bedroom - it is down the stairs and through the kitchen area. I was welcome to take a soak in the great tub after a long day of walking through Dublin.  She even has relaxing bath salts for me to use.  It was easy to catch a bus down the street to get to the centre which took about 15 minutes. It felt very safe. Her two dogs are very sweet. Lefty even wipes his feet when he comes in from outside. Delightful.
3991589,468317904,6/12/2019,"Kirsty is a kind, fantastic, and attentive host who goes above and beyond what is expected. Her historical cottage is super cute, clean, and warm. I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend staying with Kirsty (and Lefty and Tilly - the two cute, little dogs) in a heartbeat!"
3991589,472244094,6/19/2019,"I really cant imagine a better Air BnB experience than what Kirsty provided me. She was extremely attentive and friendly, a warm host willing to go the extra mile at all times. She shared her knowledge of the area (and she has a lot!), from the public transportation to the best places to catch a good rock (or country!) band. Kirsty helped make my Ireland experience extra special and I couldnt be happier."
3991589,484695189,7/9/2019,"Kirsty is a person who makes people feel safe and accepted. She has a way in having the perfect friendliness at the same time she gives the guest perfect space for privacy as well.  You will be quite alright with her ! 

Place is not far from the town centre. Walkable for those who can. A grocery store nearby, a pub and a coffee house."
3991589,491500409,7/20/2019,"I had an incredible time with Kirsty and the dogs in Dublin!
I strongly recommend her accommodation, just a few minutes walk to the city centre.
Shes also very friendly and warm with her guests!!"
3991589,499946356,8/1/2019,Kirsty is a thoughtful and easy going host and her dogs are quiet. I visited for a conference and had no issues with this conveniently located place. The room is small but it is a historic cottage so it is to be expected.
3991589,513378924,8/19/2019,This cottage is charming indeed and felt very much like being at home. The tiny garden is a superb splash of colour and the bed is very comfortable. Being able to use the kitchen was a bonus too. Kirsty even did my laundry.
3991589,517318490,8/25/2019,"My stay was 5 days long and it was amazing. My plane landed very late and Kirsty met me and my taxi driver right outside so I can find the house in the darkness! Then every morning she offered amazing coffee and some snacks. 
I needed to go to IKEA one day but it was too far away and Kirsty offered to drive me there (!), wait for me (!), and then drive me back with all my stuff! 
Also, once I was moving out she organized a taxi for me. 

The location is not bad, just 1-2km to city center, bus stop 30 meters away

The place was exactly as on photos and dogs are tiny and very cute"
3991589,524235756,9/5/2019,"I had a wonderful stay at Kirsty's. She's very friendly and accommodating, the place is cozy with awesome decor, and her two dogs Tilly and Lefty are an absolute delight. Convenient location with a 15-20 minute walk to center city and easy access to public transportation. Highly recommend."
3991589,528133119,9/12/2019,"A cosy room in a charming cottage a short walk from central Dublin, with public transport virtually on the doorstep and a lively pub just around the corner. Kirsty went out of her way to make me feel at home, was full of helpful tips and advice, offered breakfast every day, and was even kind enough to drive me up to Howth summit so I could take in the view. I couldnt have asked for a more warm and welcoming host!"
3991589,544173624,10/9/2019,Kirsty's place was unlike so many Airbnbs. It actually had character which was well thought-out rather than being an antiseptic cube of minimal decor. It felt warm and cozy just like a place you'd want to tuck into after a long day of roaming the streets of a rainy Dublin. The area felt safe and there are a couple worthy restaurants around that you don't need to walk to city centre to enjoy. The pups are very well behaved and are vv cute :D Would recommend staying
3991589,546109692,10/13/2019,"Una estancia estupenda, Kirsty es muy muy amable, hospitalaria, atenta y agradable. La casa es muy bonita y acogedora, y muy caliente, lo cual se agradece por el frio exterior. La comunicacion es muy buena y tiene muchas atenciones. Ha sido una gran experiencia, gracias Kirsty."
3991589,556721270,10/30/2019,"Outstanding hospitality from Kirsty! This place reminded me of a traditional bed and breakfast experience, and I loved it. Nice quiet street, roughly a 20 minute walk to attractions in the city. I highly recommend Kirstys place (not to mention, her two dogs are adorable!)"
3991589,566740556,11/20/2019,My stay at Kirstys was wonderful. I really felt at home with her and her two lovely dogs. We had lovely chats and wonderful laughs during the little moments we shared in the kitchen. The room is small but very cozy: I absolutely recommend it and hope I can be back in the future. Kirsty is so thoughtful to the needs of her guests: thank you is all I can say!
4003024,425518996,3/18/2019,Beautiful home located at the top of the hill with a fantastic view. My family and I stayed here and enjoyed every second of this quaint little house. Hope to come back one day!
4003024,427978597,3/24/2019,Lovely house and space. Great amenities in the house.
4003024,429267629,3/27/2019,"Very comfortable house in a perfect neighbourhood of Howth, especially due to the amazing view. Everything very clean and well prepared / organized. Due to the fact that it is a townhouse and therefore neighbours  are very close, it is most suitable for people looking for more silent environments."
4003024,430340568,3/30/2019,Fab location with amazing views. Only a short stroll to the pier. Great weekend with the girls and our little ones. Thanks for all.
4003024,433381313,4/6/2019,Great location. Beautiful home with lots of extras.
4003024,434678024,4/8/2019,"Most wonderful house with stunning views of a beautiful place. People involved were amazing . So pleased I made this choice. Will be back for longer next time,"
4003024,438733631,4/17/2019,"Fantastic little spot that gives perfect access to the sites of Ireland. Paula was an amazing host, and we loved our time in Howth!"
4003024,442794390,4/24/2019,Paulas home is a great place to stay. It is very comfortable and decorated very nicely. We especially loved all the wonderful artwork. It was very convenient for traveling to Dublin and the surrounding areas. The town of Howth itself is a great little town. It is beautiful. It has plenty to do with really great pubs and restaurants. I highly recommend visiting.
4003024,450028843,5/8/2019,"There is no lack of space or storage in this house. I especially enjoyed the stylish and functional furniture throughout the entire place. Our group of 5 adults spent the majority of our in home time in the combined living, dining and kitchen space. The combo space is enhanced by skylights that make the room airy and pleasantly heated. There are enough couches to easily seat 6 people and plenty of surface space to set down drinks, books, etc. The kitchen is really well equipped for someone who enjoys cooking. There are plenty of pots, pans, cooking utensils, cutting boards, etc. (Finding aprons was fantastic). The minor negative note is the dull knives and scratched teflon that is found in just about all rental kitchens. There's a good butcher, wine shop and deli just down the hill. (Going back up the hill definitely provides you with excellent  justification for a treat).  Getting to central Dublin by car or public transportation is very easy.  Paula responds quickly and efficiently to all communications. To sum, it is a fantastic experience and I would not hesitate to book here again. Finally, I'd be negligent if I didn't  send a shout out to the lovely neighbor who checked us in. Cheers Margaret. It was great to meet you."
4003024,450729543,5/10/2019,"Our stay at Paulas home in Howth was the perfect end to our ten days in Ireland. The home sits atop a hill overlooking the harbour and village below. We were walking distance to the sea walk and pubs, many tea shops and restaurants, on another stay we would make Howth our home base. Thank you for a great stay."
4003024,451956909,5/12/2019,"A beautiful house, very clean, warm and cosy, very stylish. Generous with groceries being left, very handy for us. Second time for us as a family to have stayed here. We love it."
4003024,455022925,5/19/2019,"Paula's place lived up to our expectations. A very bright, airy living space, with everything we needed to make our weekend in Howth very special. The place was spotlessly clean and the beds super comfy. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay there again."
4003024,457998180,5/25/2019,"We enjoyed your place, the views were great and would recommend it to anyone.   It was an overall great experience.  we had enough room for our family of 6 and the amenities were top notch!"
4003024,472791059,6/20/2019,This is an absolutely great house and gorgeous town. We had an amazing family vacation!
4003024,480717538,7/3/2019,"We had a lovely time in Howth - The house is so comfortable and perfectly appointed. It was a great location for exploring Howth, Dublin, and the surrounding region. We would love to return someday!"
4003024,484053185,7/8/2019,"My family & I really loved this wonderful updated home, its highly recommend.
Incredible location & witnessed beautiful sunset views. Hospitality outstanding, Paula is incredibly personable with a wonderful sense of humor, she had even arranged to have milk, butter, bread available, as well as tea, coffee & sugar. Fabulous amenities & very friendly neighbors who were very helpful.
We even played a few games of chess from their great array of games.
I definitely will return to this lovely home, if they are not fully booked after this review. Ha Ha"
4003024,485228165,7/10/2019,"We loved at Paula's place. Lots of space, very bright. Tons of amenities. We've never an AirBnb so fully stocked. There were enough to towels to dry a football team. The kitchen was also well-stocked and allowed us to cook meals in some nights. Beautiful location with great view. Washer and drier on premises. The most amazing coffee we've ever seen. A quick drive to the Dublin airport. Close to the center but feels like a small village with great access to cliff hiking and walking along the pier. Excellent restaurants within walking distance (if you are okay with walking up a steep hill). Paula was communicative and helpful. She even let us check out an hour late because of our flight time. Would definitely stay again and a great place to end our three-week adventure in Ireland."
4003024,489239505,7/16/2019,We hebben het erg lekker gehad in dit mooie huis in Howth. Vooral de grote leefruimte is ons erg goed bevallen.
4003024,493951975,7/23/2019,"Very comfortable house with everything you need, exceptional host. You will feel right at home."
4003024,526731338,9/9/2019,"A great house with amazing living space, location and views. The house was so very well equipped. You really wanted for nothing. So many nice touches included along with the welcome pack."
4003024,529188444,9/14/2019,"Paulas house was something out of a book. Picture perfect scenery up a quaint road, with friendly neighbors and everything you could need. The town of Howth is beyond great. It is 25 minutes from Dublin, and worth every minute of the drive as most of it is along the Irish Sea. When you wake up in the morning you can walk to the back patio, and have a clear view of the Irish Sea and the Island known as The eye of Ireland.ù The house has everything that you would need and more, it is stocked up perfectly. Paula even left us a welcoming gift of homemade Irish bread, butter, and milk- all of the finest quality. The home was extremely spacious with two family rooms, a large kitchen, a back room stocked with washer/dryer and a large bathroom w/ heater, 3 bedrooms upstairs as well as a good sized bathroom. A dream home on a magical peninsula. The restaurants and views down the pier were beyond what he expected. Highly Recommend!"
4003024,535805495,9/25/2019,This property was exactly as advertised. Very clean and very well appointed. Great location close to Howth village and local amenities. Nice touches from the hosts including basic food requirements on our arrival. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great home in a great location.
4003024,538786351,9/30/2019,"Beautiful houseîcomfortable, so much natural light, and with everything we needed for a wonderful family weekend. The view is spectacular! Check-in and check-out were super easy. Thank you for sharing your home with us, Paula and Ivan!"
4003024,546238761,10/13/2019,Fantastic location with gorgeous views.   Beautiful home!!
4003024,553168509,10/23/2019,"The house is nice and perfectly equipped. Especially the kitchen with coffee machine, two owens, big stove, dishwasher and an incredible amount of kitchenware. A lot of common area for sitting together, comfortable bedrooms with a lot of cabinets and chests of drawers for clothes. Positive is as well, that you will find there prepared basic things like teabags, koffee beans used for installed coffee maker, oil, different spices to flavor food and practical things like plastic bags, papier tissues, etc. 
But some things I have to also criticize: 1. Only very, very small refrigerator for so big house it total nonsense. Luckily was quite cold outside (second half of October) so we were able to let all drinks and part of food outside, but no idea how we would store there food for 5 ar 6 people during summer; 2. Very cold second bathroom in ""utility"" house which is behind the terrace; 3. Too difficult system how to control heating, hot water, lit a fireplace, etc. And unfortunately in the house book are just very basic information like ûset ON"" and it's done. But in fact it is not."
4003024,555982624,10/28/2019,"Paula has a beautiful, immaculate and stylish home. The kitchen is very well equipped. Paula was thoughtful in keeping eggs, bread, butter etc in the refrigerator. A detailed manual on just about everything in and around the house made things very easy. The neighbour was very helpful in the check in process. The house is very close to the marina which has many restaurants, bars and some grocery shops. There is a lovely church just 5 minutes away from the house. We loved our stay in Howth."
4003024,558683225,11/3/2019,Great family house with a view. Fully equipped and perfectly located in Howth. Paula is very reactive and always happy to help should any problem arise. We will come back!
4003024,561333937,11/9/2019,A beautiful house in Howth only 5 minutes walk down to the main area (although the hills in Howth are fun). Excellent facilities and great communication with the hosts made everything convenient and easy.
4003024,568446426,11/24/2019,"Paulas home is ideally located in the beautiful village of Howth. The house itself is very tastefully decorated with beautiful bedrooms and great space downstairs for gathering together for meals and chats. The kitchen is stocked with everything you could need including cutlery, crockery, glasses, condiments etc. Towels, bathrobes and slippers are also provided which helps cut down on luggage. There is a patio area outside which would be a great gathering place in better weather. There are beautiful views of Howth and the sea from both the front and back garden. 5 of us had a very relaxed weekend and we hope to come back some day. We were welcomed and shown around the house by Margaret and Tom and they were next door if we needed them. Thank you Paula and Ivan."
4013328,419620066,3/4/2019,A very welcoming cozy place and area in the outskirts of Dublin. Susan is happy to help with everything.

4013328,449349286,5/6/2019,"Susan was such a great host, super friendly and helpful. Great room if you want a quiet time to yourself. In a beautiful neighborhood right outside of Dublin. The train was also super easy to take and drops you off very close to the house."
4013328,452574286,5/13/2019,Susan was very helpful in recommending things to do and how to get around. The place was clean and I had no issues at all. And it was really nice being so close to the bus stop.
4013328,455879761,5/20/2019,"Susan's house is an excellent option for those travelling in or around Dublin. The train station is only a 5 minute walk away and Dublin is only 5 stops away. The house and guestroom are both very clean, and Susan provides everything necessary for an enjoyable stay."
4013328,463405197,6/3/2019,"Great location, five minutes from the bus stop and close to the train station. The room was as advertised with enough space for one person. Susan was nice and communicative, even gave me advice on which buses to take during my stay. 

10/10"
4013328,470529394,6/16/2019,The room is great and Susan is very friendly! Easily reacheable from the center by bus
4013328,475420599,6/24/2019,"Susan and her husband are very friendly and accessible for when you have doubts.  She has a lot of information about the city, compatible accessories so you can load your electronic items, toiletries so you do not worry about taking them.  While it is in a remote area of the city center, do not worry that it is very well connected and around you find Restorant of fast food and minimarket."
4013328,498094180,7/29/2019,Excepcional. Muy detallista y encantadora.
4013328,502204088,8/4/2019,Thanks Susan for the stay!
4013328,522533418,9/2/2019,Susan has hosted me for the last 3 years and I always return because the experience is great. Susan and her family are very friendly towards me and I've grown more fond of their dog every time I visit. Really recommend Susan's place for anyone looking for an AirBnB around the area.
4013328,530823841,9/16/2019,"I had a super stay in Dublin helped enormously by staying in Susan's very comfortable home. The description is all it says here and more, and it was outstanding value for money.

Susan's communications and helpful tips and advice were in evidence as soon as I made the booking and got in touch with her, and the room is ideal if you need a comfy base while staying in the Dublin area.

The bedroom and bathroom - the main two areas visitors are likely to experience - were spotlessly clean and tidy, and there were some welcome touches such as a little kettle and bits and pieces to make hot drinks, and many thanks for supplying toiletries such as shower gel - a big help rather than messing about finding small enough ones to take on the plane. The wi-fi was excellent.

Although Susan's home is a bit out of Dublin centre, the train service form the nearby station (10 minute walk tops) is very frequent and gets you into the centre of Dublin in about 20 minutes. I gather there are plenty of buses from a nearby stop, too, but I didn't use them.

One tip you may have read already: get a visitors Leap travel card. For ‚Ç¨19.50 (at time of writing) it gives you train, bus and tram travel including the DART railway and Airlink buses to get you  to and from the airport. It means staying at Susan's makes even more sense as you'll spend next to nothing getting to and from the city.

Thanks Susan!"
4013328,538020470,9/29/2019,"Susan is a super friendly host, bed is really comfortable and the area was very calm and quiet. Really enjoyed my stay!"

4013328,553998043,10/25/2019,"Susan is a great host, very helpful and kind. The room and bathroom were clean. The location is good, about 10 minutes from the train station and 5 minutes from the bus station, very recommended."
4013328,559584175,11/4/2019,Hospitable hosts and cozy room. Pleasure to stay with them.
4013328,566715493,11/20/2019,"Absolutely delightful place to stay. When I saw how cheap it was I thought despite good reviews... There must be something wrong!! It was comfortable, clean, quiet and fit the purpose of my stay. I would highly recommend Susan's home"
4029713,425428053,3/18/2019,Brian and Sheila went above and beyond in treating Vanessa and me with optimal hospitality and care. Brian picked us up at the train station when we arrived and gave us a detailed explanation of how to use public transport in Dublin to get around. He suggested lots of great places to go for food and drinks and the best times to catch the St. Patrick's Day parade. He would even cook us amazing breakfasts every morning before we'd leave to explore! Not to mention that Sheila has decorated their home with exquisite pieces of art that make their home resemble a chic gallery. Brian and Sheila made our trip extraordinary and memorable! I would highly recommend staying with them!
4029713,540961355,10/4/2019,"Brian is not just the perfect host, he IS THE HOST a tourist needs.

It was 10 min by bike to most of the places we wanted to see (Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Castle Bear, etc). Her home was very clean and felt like home away from home.

4059266,473853249,6/22/2019,"Vanessa's place was a perfect home base for my work week in Dublin. It's quiet at night with respectful neighbors and close to most all tech companies, should you be in town for that reason. It's a very safe area and has some decent options when it comes to food and drinks. 
Vanessa was very helpful and communicative all through the trip and I highly recommend her place should it be open for bookings. Thanks so much for the great stay!"
4059266,476093917,6/25/2019,"I've stayed at 40+ airbnbs during my trip around the world. This was one of the more expensive ones, but it was also by far the best. The place was excellent, the host was excellent, and location was excellent. There were so many thoughtful touches that make it clear Vanessa is an attentive experienced host. I wish every airbnb was up to this very high standard."

Vanessa was very responsive and check in was very easy.  The neighborhood is about a 20 min walk from the downtown part of Dublin.  We liked this because it was quiet and a nice place to recharge after our long days of walking around.  There is a bike share available nearby too!  There are a handful of restaurants and some shops nearby.  We loved this spot called Nutbutter!  Having the washer was a huge plus for us too.  Would highly recommend staying here.  Very comfortable apartment with plenty of space!"
4059266,516544851,8/24/2019,"We got there later than expected, so the self-check in was worry-free. Venessa thought of a many details in the apartment that made our stay a good one. For example, we forgot to bring electrical plug converters and were impressed that the apartment had several handy. Also a list of nearby restaurants with opening hours helped us quickly find a place for dinner. The area is modern and there were more restaurants and grocery stores nearby than I expected. Overall the apartment was very clean and convenient. Venessa was quick and helpful whenever we had questions."
4059266,520950035,8/31/2019,"Vanessa's place is absolutely amazing! I visited Dublin for a business trip and the location of this apartment is great.

There is a hairdryer with a diffuser (just FYI for ladies trying to pack light) and they have multiple adaptors for electronics in the apartment as well. They provided many tips and recommendations on all the local spots (i.e. restaurants, pubs, grocery stores), which there are plenty very close by and many within walking distance. The apartment is in a GREAT location with easy to use public transportation close by. Vanessa and Fabiano provided leap cards (public transit card) for us to use and top off with money, saving us the hassle of having to go out and get one at the start of are trip & this way we were able to get to sightseeing as soon as we got there. Communication was fast and they were very courteous- they checked on us right before and at check-in, throughout the trip as needed, and before check-out, always making sure we were ok and had everything we needed. I HIGHLY recommend Vanessa and Fabiano as hosts and their lovely apartment in Dublin! Thank you both again for a lovely stay/experience from Natasha and I both!"
4059266,545003098,10/11/2019,"I had the fortune of staying in Vanessa's wonderful apartment for a week. The location could not be better, a mere two minute walk from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. It's the perfect hub whether you're travelling on business or visiting for a holiday. The apartment itself is modern and clean with lots of thoughtful touches and quirky design features. I especially enjoyed the cozy bed and amazing shower. The apartment also has excellent internet so you can plan your day's activities or chill by watching your favourite show in the evening. The apartment has everything you need with every home comfort to feel like you're staying at a home away from home. Highly recommended and would definitely stay again."

4059266,554441068,10/26/2019,"Vanessas place is tastefully decorated, and is spotlessly clean.

She provided clear check in instruction for me, which makes check in a breeze."
4059266,557976376,11/2/2019,"A beautiful apartment in the best location of Dublin!

Er is een living beschikbaar en ook de keuken voor ontbijt is praktisch en ruim.
Op 5 min wandelen naar de bus en dan 45 min op bus voor centrum Dublin. Zelf met auto kan ook natuurlijk maar wij verkozen het gemak van openbaar vervoer (8,60 ‚Ç¨ voor 2 volwassenen en 2 kinderen)
Met de auto een 45 minuten van de mooie Wicklow Mountains en 20 minuten van de luchthaven.

4086947,531395062,9/17/2019,"The location was not easy to get to from Dublin Airport. It would have taken us over 1.5 hours by public transport, and with luggage, that would¬¥ve been strenuous. Instead we ended up renting a car. 

Location is nice and quiet with small stores all around,  Breakfast place around the corner was great as well as the Sushi Restaurant.

We took the car into Dublin and paid very high rates for public parking, as public transport system seemed to difficult."
4086947,534836590,9/23/2019,"This place is a must if visiting Dublin, its just on the outskirts. The rooms were spotless, the breakfast was plentiful. Julie and Dave are fabulous hosts really friendly and welcoming. Just perfect"

4087934,434675947,4/8/2019,A very nice accommodation. The room was tidy and clean. The electric blanket was lovely. Bathrooms are shared (as you can read in the description) but this is not a problem at all. We found both bathrooms clean tidy and free every time. The (Hidden by Airbnb) are lovely and helpful if you need something. I reccomand it!
4087934,437246463,4/14/2019,Very nice hosts and good location: the bus stop to get to the city center is right around the corner. Aside from some minor things everything seemed mostly clean.
4087934,442750546,4/24/2019,"Great value for a place which was walking distance to downtown. Johnathan, Ed, Clare, and Juliane were all good hosts and fun to have a chat with.

It is a very convenient place, with a bus stop close by and a Tesco and The White Moose Cafe around the corner. Also, a beautiful walk through the campus grounds is close by. Having access to Netflix and Playstation is a big luxury. This place will always be the first choice for us and comes highly recommended."
4087934,459386480,5/27/2019,"The house was a bit far from city centre (30/40 min stroll from Temple bar) but it was spotless clean and very charming. Its also a very quiet neighbourhood so we could sleep very well. The room was very cozy, the bed was comfy and both bathrooms were nice. 

We didnt use the kitchen as we only came back to sleep but it was well fitted. 

We didnt interact very much with the hosts but communication was very good. The guide was really useful! I would recommend you check the location of the house before arriving as some apps shows several locations under the same street name so if you arrive late at night its a bit annoying. 

We recommend them!"
4087934,460527509,5/29/2019,A really nice place to stay
4087934,463857848,6/4/2019,"Great, affordable place to stay while youre in Dublin. I personally think its a great spot to stay if you want to feel like youre a Dubliner and part of the city. Its about a 20-25 minute walk to the City Centre where all the action is. Otherwise there a few good restaurant spots and local pubs right the corner. Be sure to read the guide provided and just ask people where to go because everyone is so friendly. Cheers!"

But above everything, Jason will do the impossible to make you feel good and confortable and provide you the best stay experience.
We strongly recommand to meet him!!!"
4092157,469882269,6/15/2019,"Host was a friendly guy and left us to come and go as we pleased. 

The house itself didnt quite live up to expectation. We spent all our time in the bedroom as the living room was a bit shabby, and the kitchen a little dirty looking.

Would be happy to recommend if youre staying a short period and wouldnt be in the house very much."

4118242,454025468,5/17/2019,"A Clean, quiet house  with safe parking is top of my list while I'm working away from home. Brian's place is exactly that and also its close to everything that I need while I'm in Dublin City."
4118242,496193320,7/27/2019,"Brian and his wife have a wonderfully artisan like home with fantastic colours and design that makes you feel immediately warm, comfortable, and welcomed as soon as you arrive. The location is amazing in the fact that it is so close to the water with refreshing walks and breathtaking scenery to be had, but a short, short walk to the train station to do all the exploring youd like to do in the city and beyond. Breakfast was top notch and only topped by the conversation that went with it! I highly recommend adding this place to you Airbnb experience!"

The space provided was exactly as described and quite suitable for the purpose we intended.  A separate bathroom, shared between the two rooms we rented served us well, although a few  people seemed to have an issue getting hot water for their showers. There are coffee shops and pubs a relatively short walk and the airport is fairly convenient. Overall,  it was a good value and pleasant stay."

The beds were very comfortable and the house equipped with everything we needed. We were grateful for a continental breakfast before an early departure. 
If we had more time there was a lovely outdoor area to enjoy but we chose to walk and eat at the local pub which is 5 star and a 2 minute walk away. 
This was a perfect stopover and Julie is a great host."

4172796,424766664,3/17/2019,"Charming space in a historic home with lots of personal touches. The living room and kitchen are spacious,  with big windows and natural light. It was a good space to convene and relax. Although there is a night club in the lower level, the noise did not bother us.  Enda was a good host and accommodating of our check-in and check-out needs."
4172796,437231855,4/14/2019,"Enda's place is very comfortable and perfectly located near St. Stephen's Green so one can visit all amazing museums and other sites of central Dublin.  Enda and his partner live in a 300+ year old building so it has a cozy, baroque feel with all kinds of artwork throughout.  It is wonderful.  Enda charmed our 5 year old, and I would 100% recommend this for families with young children.  Thanks again!"
4172796,458764916,5/26/2019,"As other reviewers have stated, Enda has a lovely home and the location is great. I did feel very welcomed as a guest, wine and snacks were left for me when i arrived. However, I would say to expect a more lived inù space than other Airbnbs- it very much feels like someones house, including a bit of clutter and not the cleanest place Ive stayed in (nothing alarming, just like youre staying at a family members home more than a clean space). For a large family using all the beds this would be a better value. As a single traveler or couple, I think I wouldve preferred a smaller, more tidy space. If you are looking for character and coziness, this place is good."
4172796,483291648,7/7/2019,Lovely base for our family to return to after days of adventuring around beautiful Ireland. Enda was full of tips and gave us great recommendations. Positive experience!
4172796,487799263,7/14/2019,"This is a very much lived in apartment in a charming old building. Great location, easy access and walking distance to the heart of Dublin. There is a great deal of neighborhood noise throughout much of the night but we were prepared for that. Enda was very responsive to messages and provided suggestions about things to do and see."
4172796,500567695,8/2/2019,"Enda was a great host which made for a very convenient and enjoyable stay. The apartment is very large and filled with charming antiques and trinkets.  Great location. Although there is a night club in the basement of the building, noise only really came in through the windows - but that is to be expected on Leeson street. Thanks again Enda everything Enda, we had a great time!"
4172796,508785941,8/13/2019,"This is a great place to stay, very roomy and very close to the city centre.  A bit quirky with the decor and furnishings, but we liked that.  Great host, with some provisions laid in for us which was an unexpected bonus."
4172796,525885668,9/8/2019,great flat in a great location. Enda is a top bloke
4172796,529780836,9/15/2019,"This is a special place to stay for those who value art and the coziness that comes from staying in someone's actual home.  This is comparable to going and staying with very accommodating relatives.  This is not a minimalist house, and sports the everyday flaws of our own homes, but it has immense character.   We loved the various art and collections on display, and felt very comfortable.  Enda is extremely charming and took the time to give us thorough recommendations for the area although he was running late for his road trip.  Patti was hospitable as well and we had great conversation before they set off on their own journey.  We would highly recommend."

This is my second experience and the first time alone so I was a bit nervous staying at a accommodation hosted by a stranger. But Clare is the sweetest lady Ive ever had the privilege of meeting and your stay will be welcomed by a warm-hearted lady. She made sure that I had everything that I needed and gives tremendous hospitality to her guest. I highly recommend you to stay here. Next time I come to Dublin, Clare will be the first person I ask if there is room to stay. Shes the best. Thank you Clare for everything!"

4195273,437257546,4/14/2019,"This lovely self contained basement flat is a real home from home with a good sized sitting room, small kitchen good for cooking in and access to the back garden. Sadly the weather was too cold for us to use this but it was large and inviting. The bedroom is a large double with a small shower within it. It is slightly dated but works very well. The cloakroom is separate with the basin with limited ventilation, which might be a challenge if 4 of your were staying. The sofa bed in the sitting room suited our 11 year old well but might be cosy for two adults. Additionally the glass of the front door and window beside it are not curtained so morning light might be a problem for those sleeping in the sitting room. 

Conor and Sabine couldnt have been better TH hosts. They greeted us on arrival and departure, responded immediately to any queries and produced everything we needed. They went above and beyond.

Only thing of note is that you do tend to hear the family above in the mornings, so if you are not early risers this might prompt a wake up call!

Overall highly recommended and we would love to return. Thank you Conor and Sabine!"

Hosts were very responsive to any issues we had and we loved the village of Sandymount, such an easy walk. Also regular buses into central Dublin stop very near the front door, and lovely to get out of the downtown in the evenings for the local eateries and quiet streets."
4195273,451151219,5/11/2019,My friend and I stayed at Conors place and it was perfect for what we needed. It was walking distance to stores and close enough to the city. It was nice to not stay right in the city and have a little retreat away. It was a great experience. The apartment was wonderful and super cozy.
4195273,453649910,5/16/2019,"Very friendly host, nice Appartement, very nice Garden, well connected to Public Transport"
4195273,455915406,5/20/2019,"First, I need to express my gratitute to Conor for helping me out of a jam.  My passport fell behind the dresser and Conor found it, then mailed it to our hotel in Ennis.  Thanks a million.   The apartment was perfect.  Plenty of space.  Parking right outside on the street.  Clean and all the amenitities needed.  Because of the rain, we didn't get to use the yard until the last day but this extra space is a nice touch.  Bus picks up across the street and only 10 minutes to Trinity college.  Perfect stay."
4195273,457071363,5/23/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin!
4195273,458760564,5/26/2019,"This is a great location with many restaurants and cafes within walking distance. Our favorites were the Girl and the Goose and Al Boschetto. Conor's place was very clean and the backyard was lovely. I only wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed coffee and breakfast at the table outside. We rented a car and parking out front was not a problem by late afternoon. It does get very bright in the morning, but I sleep with an eye mask so I was not bothered by it. The shower is located in a different room than the toilet and sink, but this is helpful when you have three people trying to get ready in the morning. Conor is a very friendly and helpful host."
4195273,460869185,5/30/2019,Conor's place is very convenient to many great pubs and restaurants (we had a delicious dinner at the Merry Cobbler our first night in Dublin!).  The backyard is beautiful.  We found the guidebook very useful and really appreciated thoughtful additional touches like a couple of toys that were set out for our toddler to play with during his stay.  Thank you for hosting us!
4195273,464347904,6/5/2019,"Great location, friendly host!
We stayed in this great flat in June 2019. This good sized, very comfortable, 1 bedroom flat is an excellent base from which to explore Dublin. The flat is within a short walk to the delightful Sandymount Village, with its supermarkets, pubs and specialty shops. The bus into the city centre stops almost opposite the front door. Access is via a short flight of steps down from the footpath level and the shower is small, so visitors with limited mobility may want to look elsewhere. Despite being under the main house, there is quite a lot of natural light from the back windows, and guests can access the delightful backyard (if its not raining in Dublin!). It is worth noting that the flat is only 10 to 15 minutes to the ferry terminals. The only downside on our visit was a plumbing issue that our host worked hard to rectify. Conor is a friendly and helpful host. We would stay again!"
4195273,466597503,6/9/2019,"The place is lovely and tasteful decorated. The family added some fresh flowers which made the place smell lovely and feel like home.
It had all the amenities I needed and located in a nice area and easy to get around. Perfect for a weekend get away.
I attended a concert at Slane Castle and it was relatively easy to get there from the apartment. 
Id definitely stay here again for future visits.
Thanks a lot, Conor & family."
4195273,469186850,6/14/2019,Good basic unit. Very handy to shops and public transport. Has everything you might need.
4195273,471411935,6/17/2019,"Great location, and communication. Would definitely stay again!"
4195273,472312062,6/19/2019,"Conors place was perfect for us to stay during our recent trip to P!nks gig at the RDS Arena.

The flat below Conors main house has everything you need as a home away from home!

Unfortunately we werent there long enough to enjoy the sunshine in the attached garden.

Top communication from Conor made this an excellent spot for our trip! Highly recommmended!"
4195273,473307344,6/21/2019,"We had a great stay at Conor's apartment for two nights with our 1-year old son. It's a short walk to Sandymount with lots of cafes and pubs to choose from, and Conor provides a booklet with great recommendations. We took the train (DART) into center city Dublin and found it very easy to use and was only 2 stops away. The apartment itself is small but has all that you need. Our son enjoyed toddling around the backyard and sitting at the tiny picnic table, and we enjoyed that we could put him to sleep in the bedroom and still enjoy the living room and deck (after staying in one room hotels earlier in our trip, this was a luxury!). One thing to keep in mind that is not super clear from the listing is that the bathroom is split with the toilet off the living room, and the shower stall in the bedroom. Overall, great value and we enjoyed the apartment and location."
4195273,477374714,6/28/2019,"Great little space! Nice and homey with a large collection of books to leaf through, and a washer and clothesline for some emergency laundering! Within walking distance of a few nice restaurants and pubs, as well as some pretty scenery. Very close to the stadium if you're visiting for an event! This space made my first night in Ireland a nice experience."
4195273,480770524,7/3/2019,"For our first trip to Ireland, we 3 ladies from the U.S. saw Conors Bright and Spacious Apartment and Back Yard as a welcoming, sparkling & cozy accommodation. What we found when we entered was the FARTHEST from that.  The apartment was cold, dark and filthy with live spiders in the kitchen and cobwebs on the exposed drawer of silverware. The toaster was grimy and had not been cleaned in a very long time. The picture of the brown leather leather sofa with the orange pillows, we thought, was the pull out sofa. When we removed the cushions, flying bugs came out and there was dirt, cobwebs and crumbs.  There was NO hot water to wash our hands nor instructions how to turn it on.  We ended up starting the shower for some warm water.  Some one elses used soap and toiletries were in the shower. We went outside to the back deck and my sister stepped on a piece of rotten wood and fell through, twisting her ankle.  There is not a little white table and two chairs on the deck as the Conors pictures show.  The back yard was full of twigs and leaves, as was the trampoline and hammock.  The BBQ promised to be available for use was full of spiderwebs and had NO propane.  Hanging on the clothesline by the BBQ were sheets and towels, I imagine from the previous guest.  In the apartment, the only place to hang clothes is in an armoire.  It had 8 hangers, three of which were child size.  The clothes rack under the stairs had many coats and childrens clothes taking up space. The pots and pans on the stove and microwave are stored there because there is no room in the cabinets under the counters.  They are full of cleaning supplies. The walls and floors were mucky and unclean.  All in all,  a very unsanitary, unsafe and uninhabitable apartment.  We were and are highly disappointed to the extent we could not stay in those conditions.

When Conor greeted us, we expressed our concerns. We showed him the sofa, the kitchen and the back yard pointing out the rotted piece of decking that my sister stepped on.  Conor discounted everything we said and he NEVER apologized for any of it. Regarding the deck, he said Well, sometimes you have to replace a piece of wood, like I did over there.ù (pointing to a board that was newly replaced). Regarding the uncleanliness, Conor offered to clean the place while we waited. Conor said the person who watches his children did the cleaning for him this time because he was out of town. Conor told us Good cleaning people are hard to find in Dublin, thats why I do it myselfù.  The brown sofa was not the sleeper he stated.  The blue one was but when we pulled out the seat and back cushions, the was hard wood underneath.  The description says it is suitable for 4 guests. Maybe two adults and two very small children, certainly NOT 3 or 4 adults. There were only 2 sets of linens set out even though Conor knew there were 3 of us arriving.  We could not find another set of towels. Regarding the hot water situation, Conor told us there was a timer under the cabinets by the sink that controls the hot water.  There were no instructions in the manual about turning on the timer or how to activate the hot water, only instructions about the shower.

We told Conor that we just could not stay in these conditions and that we were going to a hotel.  It happened to be Pride weekend in Dublin and there were thousands of people in town. I said to Conor,  Since we are not staying, you can rent it out easily with as many people that have converged onto Dublin.  You wont have a problem.ù  Conors response to me and my guests was,  I cannot cancel the reservation and rent it again because that will affect my SUPER HOST STATUS and I will lose that distinction.ù  We all looked at him in disbelief. I asked him what sort of compensation he could provide since we were not staying and he only offered the cleaning deposit returned.  He said, Many people love this place, thats why I am a Super host.ù  Conor never once apologized, acknowledged our concerns or asked how my sisters ankle was.  Being more concerned with his status rather than the comfort of his guests does not make one a super host. I am appalled and dismayed at Conors lack of respect and integrity.  If this is the experience Conor wants to provide to first time guests to Ireland, I would never come back.  Thank goodness we ended up in a nice hotel for the final part of our vacation."
4195273,482358458,7/6/2019,This is a really good place
4195273,490743667,7/19/2019,"Lovely outdoor space in backyard, basement apartment . We took early am tours out of town so had to walk an hour to those pick up points as buses don't run early enough but otherwise the location in Sandymount offers relief from the hustle and bustle of Dublin proper"
4195273,494405721,7/24/2019,"Nice outdoor space, easy to get to waterfront, easy train ride to another seaside town, close to bus and transit"
4195273,497162269,7/28/2019,"Great stay ! The place was well located, the garden amazing and hosts were reactive and careful. I would recommend this place"
4195273,498862185,7/30/2019,"We loved staying in Dublin at Conor's cozy nook! It was such a sweet spot to start our trip to Ireland at. Not only was it conveniently located to the train for getting around the greater Dublin area, but Conor also provided such great knowledge of the fun spots within walking distance that we didn't even feel the need to venture out much further. We had so much fun pretending we were locals in his neighborhood and we wish we had more time to stay and try all the cool spots nearby that he recommended."
4195273,514918471,8/22/2019,"Nice friendly, helpful host. Apartment dated and could do with a deep clean but 
is a good location and adequate size for 2. The sofa bed would not be suitable for more than one child."
4195273,515795300,8/23/2019,Perfect location for ya getting to the RDS arena for a concert. Lovely large garden space which we could use. Conor was very quick at responding to any messages. Definitely recommend!
4195273,517440243,8/25/2019,"This apartment is in a fantastic location close to Sandymount and the Aviva stadium. Conors communication and check in :check out is excellent.
The photographs have been taken with a professional eye and do not reflect reality. We found the apartment pokey, dated and requiring maintenance and upgrades. 
It was much smaller than we expected based on the description and photographs. Half the ceiling lights were blown and the hot water heater in the the kitchen was not working. Of course its simple to boil a kettle to wash the dishes (which is what I did) but it should not be necessary.
We did not find the homely touches other reviewers have mentioned but agreed with those that have said that the toiled facilities are cramped. Taking a shower in such a small space quickly became a art form. 
The outside area (which we didnt use due to our busy schedule) was wonderfully quiet, secluded and well appointed."
4195273,524526942,9/6/2019,"Excellent stay for dropping off my son at UCD while also working out of my office on Silicon Dock. Conor is a great host, and extremely flexible. Flat had everything I needed for the week. Will definitely be back."
4195273,528032423,9/12/2019,"Nice apartment in a quieter part of Dublin. Chose this place as we have a toddler and we needed the extra space for him to run around. Generally the place was nice, host was very responsive and allowed us to check in early which was a great help. Agree with previous review that it would benefit from a 'deep clean', including a tidy up in the garden as we couldn't let the little one play out there alone.
You can hear the apartment upstairs, the mornings didnt bother us as we were up early and out. But if you do have kids you can hear the banging/music playing etc through the floor boards in the evening when its bed time, it's not intentional, just every day noise."
4195273,532142191,9/19/2019,Conor was so easy to communicate with and a wonderful host with such a beautiful home!
4195273,532795659,9/20/2019,"We loved our stay here! The space is very cute and clean, and the location is ideal! Conor is fantastic at communication, and always ensures you are satisfied! We would highly recommend!"
4195273,534175416,9/22/2019,Had a nice stay here! Very clean and quaint and the host was always easy to keep in contact with!
4195273,535891277,9/25/2019,"Nice place, nice area in Dublin"
4195273,537921299,9/29/2019,Great location with bus stop across the road. Very cosy but be aware the shower and bathroom are very small.
4195273,541563196,10/5/2019,Nice clean space with great kitchen and very convenient location.
4195273,544070293,10/9/2019,Great little place and very stylish
4195273,546890089,10/14/2019,"Great apartment. Best host! Good place in Dublin- quiet but not far from the city center. We had a lovely stay! Thank you, Conor and family!"
4195273,548352182,10/17/2019,"Absolutely great place to stay, would 100% recommend this place, only 10/15 mins from the centre, parking available and a really comfortable and stylish apartment."
4195273,551444265,10/20/2019,Great compact space with all facilities needed to self cater or close to restaurants / bars in Sandymount and Ballsbridge for night out. Hosts very responsive and welcoming. Highly recommend.
4195273,554468852,10/26/2019,This is a very attractive apartment which provides a great base for enjoying Dublin. The number 1 bus stops outside and it is an easy bus trip into the centre of town. It is also only a short walk to Sandymount village and Strand and to the Landsdowne stop for the Dart train. We were very comfortable in the apartment which is warm and well- appointed - and ideal for a couple. Many thanks Conor!
4195273,557592664,11/1/2019,"Conor & Celine were the best hosts we've had. Unlike so many, Conor took the time to introduce himself and give us a tour of the space when we arrived. The place was lovely. Everything was clean and neat, and there was a giant fragrant lily in full bloom in our bedroom. Huge back yard in the middle of Dublin, there was parking right on the street. Celine was putting out Halloween decorations  one evening as we were leaving for a walk, she was so friendly and helpful and gave us great suggestions of where to eat. I can't say enough, they were great."
4195273,560609901,11/7/2019,Great place in great location
4195273,562095885,11/10/2019,"The apartment was lovely and clean, good location as near train station and easy to get to the city centre"
4195273,565224135,11/17/2019,"Really nice location away from the busy areas, enjoyed the stay! Thanks"
4207682,422492542,3/11/2019,We had A very Nice stay and the host was realy looking forwards. Also the breakfast was Nice and complete. Thanks A lot
4207682,482317913,7/6/2019,Lesley is very kind and did everything to make sure we have a nice trip! I can definitly recommend to stay there!
4207682,513996204,8/20/2019,"Lesley and Brandon are wonderful and welcoming hosts. They help you around if you are new in town, and can give you tips even if you are a returning visitor. Thank you for the few days we spent with you."
4207682,524604510,9/6/2019,Lesley and Brendon were gracious and welcoming hosts.  Their home is very attractive and spotless.  The bed was fantastic and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast along with great chats with Lesley.  Very quiet at night and easily reached by car or the Dart if you don't mind a bracing walk.
4208603,422579718,3/11/2019,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it really was perfect. Lesley and Brendan were really nice and caring, they helped us with the busses and gave us a lot of advice regarding sights and pubs in Dublin and in towns along the coast. The room was very beautiful and clean, with a lot of space and everything you need (i.e. hairdryer, water kettle, towels etc.). The breakfast also was really delicious and there was a large choice of different things to eat.
All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and fully recommend this bed & breakfast!"
4208603,434007604,4/7/2019,"Brilliant room, lovely breakfast and fantastic hospitality. Lovely people with a lovely home and great seaside location!"
4208603,481801477,7/5/2019,If you want a nice peaceful place away from the city choose this place.
4208603,494497906,7/24/2019,"Lesleys place is absolutely amazing!! The location is great, nearby public transportation and places to eat. If you are looking to just walk along the coast and be outside, Lesleys place is the one!! Her home was perfect for our needs and for what we wanted to do in Ireland!! You will not regret choosing her place!!"
4208603,503744752,8/6/2019,"Lesley and her husband went above and beyond to make our Dublin experience amazing! The home is beautiful, modern, clean and I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the area. Breakfast was fit for a king and enough for an army! The location was great as it was just outside the city, but convenient in that a bus stop was just across the street."
4208603,513196112,8/19/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Lesley and Brandons very much. The room is very lovely, extremely clean and there is everything you need and more. 
Whenever we needed advice or simply if told her what we were going to do, Lesley told us what would be best for us to do.  The breakfast is very delicious and you can have everything you desire from Toast and jam to baked beans and eggs.
It really felt like home there. 
If I would spent some time in Dublin again  I would definitely come back to stay there."
4208603,521825952,9/1/2019,"Lesley's place is a few blocks away from the water, and great for anyone looking for a relaxing stay. It's about 50 min - hour bus ride from the airport and city center, but I really enjoyed the peace and quiet."
4216882,530842345,9/16/2019,Beautiful wee place! Thankyou xx
4216882,534727143,9/23/2019,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4216882,558938417,11/3/2019,"Good location, very stylish apartment with great decor."
4216958,418155291,3/1/2019,Superb location. Cant be faulted.
4216958,419646667,3/4/2019,"Very nice flat, well located. Perfect!"
4216958,422876702,3/12/2019,Great place.
4216958,424241433,3/16/2019,"As a group of 6, we stayed at Sabrinas apartment for 3 nights. Sabrinas communication was very quick and she is incredibly flexible around our checkin. 

The flat is in a great location and across the street from Temple Street. Its also only a 10 min walk to the airport bus line. It can be a bit noisey at night from people leaving the pub, but it wasnt much of an issue for us. If you are sleeping in the living room (sofa couch) you will hear the beeping from the crosswalk often. The bedrooms are a great size. 

The flat is in an older building so the bathroom is tight, but manageable. At the time of writing this, the bathroom image shows a shower with bathtub. The flat didnt have a bathtub. Its a standing shower only. 

If you are looking for a home base for a few nights and like the nightlife, its a great option."
4216958,425928272,3/19/2019,"The best Place to be. Located very conveniently in the city, Very clean and absolute comfortable. It was perfect for the St. Patricks Day.. Thank you."
4216958,426242397,3/20/2019,"Fantastic location, had a very comfortable stay."
4216958,426907460,3/22/2019,Very good and local space would highly recommend.
4216958,428512903,3/25/2019,"Clean, centrally located flat. Sabrina was great with check-in flexibility. In person check-in makes sense given the bit of a maze one goes through to reach the inside location once there and the need for both key and fob. We enjoyed our stay close to so many Dublin sights! She kindly filled the fridge with food to prepare a traditional Irish breakfast. Would definitely recommend this location."
4216958,429545572,3/28/2019,"Great location. Two coffee shops right next door. Short walk to many shopping and tourist sites. The washer/dryer combo was very nice. 

Be aware the bathroom is very small. The shower is fine, but the toilet space is very tight."
4216958,431646905,4/1/2019,"Sabrina's place is perfect!  You won't need a car the whole time you're there.   We walked to all the great attractions in Dublin as well as pubs and shops.  Sabrina sent me detailed directions (with photos) well before our scheduled stay which I was able to print out and bring along, thus,  saving my data plan.  American travelers will particularly appreciate the drip coffee maker (which is not a kitchen staple in Ireland)!  Sabrina also stocked the refrigerator with all the ingredients to make a full Irish breakfast!"
4216958,432535096,4/4/2019,This is the perfect location for staying in Dublin. Sabrina went above and beyond for us and is an excellent host. There were even breakfast items for us which was incredibly thoughtful and helpful.
4216958,433377449,4/6/2019,"We have booked the apartment with four people. The size of the apartment was absolutely sufficient for us.
The location is estklassig. Just minutes away are most of Dublin's hotspots, such as the Jameson Distillery, the Trinity Collage, or the Temple Bar Quartier.
Sabrina, our hostess was very sympathetic and helpful. The communication was straightforward and the answers to questions always came immediately. We can really recommend the apartment for a few days in Dublin and will definitely book again on our next visit."
4216958,436094456,4/12/2019,Sabrina is a wonderful host.  The apartment location is a few minute walk to the Temple Bar area and next to a Hop on Hop off  tour bus stop.  Her detailed directions and maps make it easy to find and she greets you at the door to get settled.  The apartment is spotless and a nice size for the location.  A very good choice!
4216958,437826906,4/15/2019,Had a great stay at Sabrinas place!  Awesome location and very nice apartment.
4216958,439512617,4/19/2019,Great apartment conveniently located. Very clean and well stocked. Sabrina was  responsive and helpful
4216958,446354645,5/1/2019,"We loved staying here. It was cozy, had everything we needed, and in a key location close to everything we wanted. Sabrina was very sweet. We definitely recommend this home and would be back ourselves."
4216958,449351357,5/6/2019,"This place was in a great location, sparkling clean and tastefully decorated. Security in building was unmatched by anything we had seen in any other Airbnb. Sabrina met us at checkin and made us feel welcome."
4216958,450061999,5/8/2019,The location is great. Close walk to everything and transportation to and from airport
4216958,451152833,5/11/2019,Well located.  Living space accommodating  and Sabrina responsive.   Used it as a base camp and saw and did all that Dublin had to offer.   We would stay again.
4216958,452964765,5/14/2019,"This great little apartment is right in the middle of Dublin with the famous Temple Bar area just across the river to the south, and more local favorites around the north side. The apartment was clean and comfortable and includes the bonus of a washing machine! Sabrina is quick to respond to questions and made us feel very welcome. I highly recommend this stay!"
4216958,453279087,5/15/2019,Great location for staying in west Dublin!
4216958,455109428,5/19/2019,Perfect location.  Close to everything and accommodations were great.  Great communication and check in was easy. Thanks for everything!
4216958,456380744,5/21/2019,"Very good location close to temple bar and transportation.  Quiet, convenient and clean."
4216958,456768855,5/22/2019,Sabrina's apartment is in a wonderful central location. We could walk to Temple Bar and Trinity College easily. The apartment is compact but worked perfectly for the three of us. The beds are clean and comfortable. Check-in was a breeze and Sabrina was available by phone to answer questions.
4216958,457506914,5/24/2019,Great location on a busy street minutes to everything!
4216958,457962077,5/25/2019,Great price for the amazing location close to bars and shopping!
4216958,459350323,5/27/2019,"Enjoyed our stay in Dublin at this apartment was great, fab location really close to Temple Bar! Had everything we needed and very spacious for 6 people, sofa bed was comfy and kitchen had everything we needed!"
4216958,460789192,5/30/2019,This apartment is in a super location to many of the main attractions and areas.
4216958,461941827,6/1/2019,"The location of this place is unbelievable!!  You are close to everything.   In light of that, you could here a few late night people outside.   But being just over the river from everything was so handy.  Communication with the owner was outstanding!  Dublin was terrific!"
4216958,463518088,6/3/2019,"Sabrinas place was a lot of space and an excellent location for the price. Hot water, good supplies in kitchen. The street noise was very loud and the windows do not block the sound- especially on Saturday night- noisy until at least 2am. But if you are not a light sleeper, then you will love this place for the location. I felt very safe , as there are several locked doors to get through to access the apartment. I recommend Mochaland next door for breakfast."

The people at the cafe downstairs are excellent as well. Easy to get a cab from the airport - took a little longer to get one back to the airport but not too bad."
4216958,472702872,6/20/2019,"Sabrinas place is in the ultimate location! It made site seeing in Dublin so easy as everything was on our doorstep. 
Sabrina was great to communicate with and supplied everything we needed for our group of six which made it a comfortable stay. My one comment would be that the apartment needs a decent clean. Its obviously been well used but just needs a bit of TLC to make it a 5/5 stay."
4216958,473297240,6/21/2019,Great location. Hostess gave wonderful detailed information. Great size for our family of five.
4216958,476884069,6/27/2019,The location is great to explore Dublin.  The seagulls in the area enjoy making a lot of noise at night and there is a crosswalk is under one of the windows so bring a pair of ear plugs for sleeping at night.
4216958,481219659,7/4/2019,"Its a really nice apartment. Good location and cozy. Though we are 5, It is spacious. Washing machine is helpful for us. Thank you!"

4216958,486258646,7/12/2019,Sabrina's place was very clean and in an excellent location for walking to many of the top sites we wanted to visit in Dublin. Her condo had all the amenities we needed for a very comfortable stay. We would definitely stay at her place again.

4216958,507255140,8/11/2019,Great apartment in a good location walking distance to temple bar and main attractions. Apartment was clean and safe. Great host would definitely stay here agin when in Dublin
4216958,513943545,8/20/2019,"Sabrinas place was the perfect location for our stay in Dublin. It was walking distance close to all our tour pickups, great nightlife and all the sites- didnt walk more than 20 minutes to get anywhere. 
The beds are comfy, kitchen is great and there is a great seating area and couch. 
The only downside is the extremely small toilet space, not the best shower pressure and some sort of smell throughout the entire apartment. Not unbearable, but there. 
I would definitely recommend this place and stay there again- it was exactly what we needed for 4 people for a week. 
Thank you Sabrina!"
4216958,514610571,8/21/2019,"The communication with the host was very quick, the apartment is really in city Center,so you can see all the attractions of the city! Apartment is nice and comfortable!"
4216958,515771625,8/23/2019,"It's noisy from street activity and the bathroom sink is the tiniest I've ever seen, but it is a GREAT location with everything you need for a stay just steps from Temple bar area. Close to tram & bus stops, O'Connell street and one of the BEST fine restaurants I've been to (The Winding Stair)!"
4216958,519255881,8/28/2019,"Unbeatable location in a very safe and secure building. Close to tourist/party district (can be noisy, but also very fun if youre a part of it). Walking distance to anything youd want to do in Dublin."
4216958,519780322,8/29/2019,Great stay !!
4216958,523264340,9/3/2019,A great location and good value
4216958,525121029,9/7/2019,Great location! We felt very safe during our stay. The rooms are spacious and the sofa bed is very comfy.
4216958,531808161,9/18/2019,Sabrina was very commutative and helpful when we needed. She even got us in to the Airbnb early! Which was nice. Her Airbnb is in a great location for all Dublin needs.
4216958,534895212,9/23/2019,Location is close to everything. The apartment had everything you need for a comfortable stay! Check in was made super easy and the hosts were great communicators.
4216958,537219557,9/28/2019,"Sabrinas place is exactly as described. It is a bit noisy but being so close to Temple Bar and all of city center, we dealt with the extra noise. It was great being able to walk to all of the sites on our list. I would definitely stay again."
4216958,539450740,10/1/2019,"This is a great place in the center of Dublin. Bathroom is a bit tight but lots of room everywhere else. It was very clean, quiet, well equipped and as expected."
4216958,540426531,10/3/2019,"This apartment is brilliantly located on a building right next to the main river in Dublin. Super easy to walk everywhere in town. The place was clean, had two good sized rooms and a fairly comfortable pull out couch in the living room (nice and solid, not one of those filmsy spring filled ones that fold out in three parts). The kitchen, though small, was very modern, had everything you needed to cook breakfast and even had staples in the cupboards to help you cook dinner. The fridge was only half size but that was fine for us as we weren't staying long. Wifi worked great, and for those who need a relax because of jetlag this apartment seemed quite quiet in the evenings and even during the day. 

Sabrina was super quick to respond to communications and was able to offer information for parking lots nearby (Parking our car overnight, dropping someone off at the airport in the middle of the night, and then leaving before 10am the next day cost around 28 Euro from the closest parking lot). When I left my jacket behind by accident we were able to easily arrange to pick it up when we were next in Dublin, thanks to Sabrina's kindness. 

One thing you should be aware of is that the bathroom is tiny, as in you can only fit one person literally in at a time. As it's the only bathroom, it is the only toilet, so if you're there with more than four people you may find it takes a couple of hours for everyone to get showered etc. On the plus side the heating doesn't run out and I seem to remember good shower pressure. The place is a bit of a maze to get into so definitely don't leave your keys behind as there are multiple doors to unlock along the way. Sabrina provides you with all the instructions for that though. The cleaner forgot to leave out bedding for our fifth person in the living room pull out, but we managed to find enough in the cupboards to make things work. 

All in all a great option if you want to be in town and have a moderate sized group. Attentive hosts and clean."
4216958,542190993,10/6/2019,Alles zu Fuss bestens erreichbar.

4216958,548278274,10/17/2019,"We had a great time at Sabrina's apartment, we were five and had enough space for every one of us.

4216958,552683685,10/22/2019,"Great place in the city! Perfect stay for walking trips.  Good food and shopping.  Parking  was very close but a bit expensive.

Beds could have been a bit more comfortable but all in all it was  great experience.

4229727,424291146,3/16/2019,"Staying with Clare was a perfect way to start my Irish Adventure! Couldn't have asked for more! Clare let me check in early, gave advice and tips on the city, brought me to my first castle, around Clontarf to see the local views and even gave me a lift to city centre when she could! I can't say enough about how much I loved my stay! I'd been advised to be weary of the Northern part of Dublin but there  was nothing to fear in Clontarf. Such a beautiful spot!"

She is always there to help with tips regarding Dublin or the stay itself. When I was checking in, she was cooking and invited me for meal.  I was staying there for 4 weeks in total and I can definetly recommend the place. Especially when you stay for some more time, you can find a home at Clare's place. She is a lovely and very welcomed lady, who tries to do everything to make you feel home. There is a breakfast everyday, she provides towels and changes the linen weekly. You can also wash your clothes, if you stay for some more time. The neighbourhood is really nice and peaceful and there is a park just at the end of the street. The bus to the city is just 20 minutes. I've already booked my next stay at here home and I am looking forward to come back :-)"

4229727,532624112,9/20/2019,"Clares home is such a delightfully quite, clean and comfortable space in a very nice neighborhood. It is close to all public transportation, atms, grocery stores, coast line and more. Her hospitality is over and beyond any expectations in such a positive way. Immediately after booking, she provided an email with everything I could need to know for getting around etc so I knew then the stay would be wholesome. She does host other guests simultaneously, so earplugs are good if you are like me and slow to adjust to time zone differences. I will absolutely stay with her again on future visits. Having the shower in my room was a very nice convenience, and ALL of her rooms are beautiful. Her home has so much charm and positive, respectful and safe energy."

The room itself is cozy and stylish, with very comfortable beds. It also came with a helpful map of the area. Youre right around the corner from a great restaurant - Two Boys Brew. Its an easy 15-20 minute walk from the Aircoach stop. We could access transportation on Berkeley and the walk to City Centre within 20 minutes. Check-in and check-out was smooth and uncomplicated. Id recommend this AirBnb for others in Dublin."

Be sure to walk over to Blessington Basin - an amazing walled garden / duck pond. Less than a mile away is the National Botanic Garden and Cemetery - both world class with guided tours available.

Great location allowing ready access to the city on the nearby Luas.  Also a couple of great pubs and cafes within walking distance. Happy to recommend"
4274089,494432844,7/24/2019,"Come stay here!! Claire was an amazing host. Right when my taxi arrived I was warmly greeted by her and her adorable kids. I was visiting alone with my infant and she was so accommodating, even offered to move the bed around and had a pack and play in the room with toys before we got there! I also was having a hard time walking around with no suitable stroller and she offered me her own stroller (which she absolutely did not have to do)!! Towards the end it felt as if I made a friend rather than just being a host. Will definitely be coming back on my second trip here. 100% recommend!!"

4282658,440167046,4/20/2019,"A great house close to the city, would be a bit far to walk if you have kids and intend to do additional walking in Dublin.

Deirdre gave us a beautiful welcome with hot tea, fresh flowers and bottle of wine. House is a bit full with personal things and parking with rental car a bit uneasy with max. 3 hours and starting 7am.  2 showers for 5 people which could not be used at the same time is also a bit uneasy. But house is a true home and everything else was perfect. Kamala"

4282658,480258586,7/2/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay at Deirdre's lovely home in Rathmines. The location was excellent, close to lots of restaurants and shops and an easy commute into downtown Dublin. The house is very comfortable with 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a powder room.  There is a lovely kitchen and family room at the back of the house that opens up to a small garden. We spent all of our time there.

We were in Ireland for a wedding and the house was a perfect home camp.  We had two families sharing the space and never felt crowded.  The kitchen is a great place for conversation or to have a great fry!  The home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to everything.  I highly recommend this beautiful home and hope to someday go back!"

4294854,425421605,3/18/2019,"Andrews place was fantastic for my friend and I. The location was perfect, as it is in the center of the city with only short walks to the river and Jameson distillery.

4294854,437033268,4/14/2019,Andrew was an awesome host! Very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean as the rest of the apartment. A good location to stay if you want to visit the town center. The only minus point is the noise from the fruit market in front of the house that opens at dawn
4294854,444833190,4/28/2019,"Andrew is a great host, always available for any questions. The apartment is perfectly located"
4294854,465277938,6/7/2019,Andrew is an amazing host. His place is super conveniently located and 5 mins of a walk from Temple Bar and all the major attractions are at a walkable distance too. He also went out of his way and helped me with carrying my bag up and down the stairs. And is super friendly. I am a female solo traveler and his place felt absolutely safe. I would definitely stay here again if I visit Dublin. And would recommend it to everyone else.
4294854,470546239,6/16/2019,"Andrew welcomes us very well and helped us to carry on the luggage. The apartment is very good situated and every place in Dublin is 15/20 minutes by foot. The room is a little bit small but we could go in the living room and the kitchen (very well equipped). Andrew has a very good coffee machine to make normal coffee. 
The only little problem is the noise
In the street, because there are some constructions all around and we could hear the machines early in the morning.... 
But Andrew is very cool and a good host. I recommend this place."
4294854,472815102,6/20/2019,"Andrew is a great host who responds very quickly to messages. The apartment is in a fabulous location. Andrew was helpful with location tips and recommendations. Overall, good value for money."

4294854,486175247,7/12/2019,"The location is AMAZING!  You can literally walk to everything and we did!

Andrew is upfront about the noise from the Market below, but to be honest it didn't bother us much.  The room is a little tight with two adults and luggage but made it work with Andrew's help. 

Jameson is just down the street and Guinness is about 15 /20-minute walk.  Shopping and Pubs are just around the corner.  

A great location to find everything Dublin has to offer."
4294854,495052396,7/25/2019,"Andrews apartment is great for someone who wants to explore Dublin for the first time as its a short walking distance  to the most popular tourist areas such as Temple Bar, plus is right next to the busy OConnell street which has loads of shops and bus routes to the airport.

4294854,528640667,9/13/2019,"Andrew is a great host and the apartment is in an amazing location! You can pretty much walk everywhere. The living space was comfortable and Andrew also offered us cereals for breakfast in the morning which was appreciated!

The only downside was the noise - it was much louder and earlier than we expected. We assumed the noise would be just general hustle and bustle but it was more like beeping lorries and construction work down the road. A bit grating at first but eventually got used to it with ear plugs/headphones.

Other than that, it was great value and perfect for a short stay :)"
4294854,536226498,9/26/2019,"Andrew's apt is very conveniently located. It was in easy walking distance to cafes, transit and important tourist sites. 
The apartment is in an older building but Andrew keeps it tidy and modern.  The bed in the guest room is very comfortable. The only drawback is the noise of the wholesale fruit and veg market coming alive at 430am across the street."
4296435,468788569,6/13/2019,"My husband & I stayed at Dees place for a week and it was very nice! It was clean and comfortable with everything we needed, and the bus stop to get to city centre is just a short walk away. She was available to answer a few of our questions, and she has a sweet & mellow dog & cat that will greet you as well. Checking in & out could not have been easier. Overall a quiet & quaint accommodation at a great price for Dublin."
4296435,472289440,6/19/2019,"Dee's place was absolutely idea while I was staying in Dublin, it was great value for money and had everything that you could need in terms of amenities that are provided.

4296435,529813016,9/15/2019,"Lovely, private and quiet separate cottage at the back of the property. ( i did not understand this from the website). Dee is an excellent host - very responsive to any requests or issues with the house. 
We could not work the TV -  but this did not matter to us. Likely our ineptness !!!! 
Highly recommended for the independent traveller who values staying in a  realù irish neighbourhood, privacy and value."
4296435,534948296,9/23/2019,A very nice and clean place to stay. Dee is very helpful. I would definitely recommend staying here.
4304405,424287449,3/16/2019,Great location.
4304405,427298403,3/23/2019,Patrick was a great host. His place is in a great location and he was great communicating with us. I definitely recommend using his place and hope it is available if I ever visit Dublin again.
4304405,453655621,5/16/2019,"Patricks apartment was perfect for us.  We were 2 couples.  Having a washing machine was very convenient since we will be traveling for 2 months.  The location in Smithfield was very convenient for touring around Dublin.  The Tram is just a block away, the express bus to the airport, other buses, and the Hop on Hop off bus stops are very near.  It is also convenient to walk to the tourist areas.  The location has plenty of restaurants, pubs and grocery store near by.  The location was also relatively quiet.  We would definitely stay here again.  Patrick provided us with loads of information. Thank you Patrick."
4304405,518791243,8/27/2019,"Pats place is spacious and comfortable (with great views over the Dublin skyline), and in a fantastic location. The Luas tram stops just outside but its also walkable to many Dublin sights.  With a number of restaurants, coffee shops, a pharmacy and a fresh food supermarket just below the apartment, its v convenient for meals and amenities.  Theres also a mini playground outside for kids.

Pat is a friendly host who met us exactly as planned and ensured we had all that we needed on arrival.  There were lots of tourist information leaflets and guidebooks in the apartment.  It was also nice to find a few useful food items left in the kitchen - condiments, sugar, tea bags, etc."
4304405,524527397,9/6/2019,"A comfortable and airy apartment in a fantastic location, walking distance to just about anything you could want or need in the city. Patrick was a great host--responsive and thoughtful. We had a great time!"
4304405,542428907,10/6/2019,"It was a spacious, bright apartment in a good location but it was tired. 
The apartment would benefit from a fresh coat of paint and some TLC.  I felt the bedding and towels were of inferior quality, the towels being quite stiff."
4304405,546957393,10/14/2019,"Patrick was great to work with and the apartment is in a great part of town, making every thing walkable."
4304405,552209624,10/21/2019,"Patrick's place is perfectly located near all kinds of wonderful restaurants, pubs, transit and museums. It is quiet and clean, modern and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay!"
4304405,565383458,11/17/2019,"Pat met us and explained how everything worked.  He also told us of places to visit in the area.  We were a group of mature ladies on a girly 
weekend from scotland and the apartment gave us everything we needed and was very warm and comfortable"
4313059,418929777,3/3/2019,"Modern house, good location!"
4313059,419601546,3/4/2019,Great location for access to Temple Bar and central Dublin
4313059,420641516,3/7/2019,"Very comfortable, great location and excellent hospitality!"
4313059,422558224,3/11/2019,"Unfortunately we werent able to get in contact with Andy at all during the stay. I had messaged before arrival to ask about taxis, and called on arrival to ask about parking. He replied to my message the day after my stay saying hed been on a long haul flight, in those circumstances he shouldve given me an alternative contact or not taken a booking. 

The house was fine, although the thermostat was set to only 14.5 degrees when we arrived so it was very cold and too a long time to warm up. 

The house is well situated for a visit to the city and for for purpose for a night or two."
4313059,423196672,3/13/2019,My two college-aged children stayed at Andys place and found everything as described.  It was a perfect location for walking to all the sites and check-in could not be easier!
4313059,423514739,3/14/2019,"Clean, great location"
4313059,425499691,3/18/2019,"Nice, clean flat. Great location. Very easy to check in, good response from the host."
4313059,425902166,3/19/2019,"Great location! Easy walk to Temple Bar and many other attractions. Street was quiet. Parking was readily available during the week. We were not there on the weekend so I cant attest to that. Apartment was clean, beds were comfortable. Overall, a great stay!"
4313059,429583269,3/28/2019,Location! This place is a short walk from almost all attractions Dublin has to offer. Andy was quick to respond and gave us plenty of local recommendations. We would definitely stay here again!
4313059,429881106,3/29/2019,Really convenient to city center. Walked everywhere! Easy check-in and check-out. Would stay here again.
4313059,430833317,3/31/2019,"Stayed at Andys house, my first Airbnb experience. It was so lovely. A real home from home. I would definitely stay again"
4313059,431978386,4/2/2019,Great communication and location. Very clean and cosy l!
4313059,434650412,4/8/2019,Perfect area and adorable space!
4313059,435083914,4/9/2019,Andy's place is a great location. Near everything but far enough away to avoid the noise. He has great suggestions for local spots and ways to get around. We did have an issue with the wifi not working. And the original description stated flexible check in time but we were then told strict check-in time of 2pm so we had to alter some plans but it worked out okay. Only other issue was with the smell. We experienced an odor when we first checked in. Could have been from the cleaner used but it was very noticeable.
4313059,438227919,4/16/2019,"Central, amazing location!  Close to everything, including the hop-on hop-off busses, 10 minute walk to the Long Hall library to see the Book is Kells, 5 minute walk to Temple Bar. The place was very clean and quiet and check in was code entry, very easy. We stayed here with our school aged kids and there was plenty of room for the 4 of us. It took a bit of time to find the fridgeîit is in the closet with cleaning materials and the washer.   Check out was strict 11 am î we were washing the dishes and starting to take out our  at 11 and the cleaning lady came right then at 11:05. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4313059,438658228,4/17/2019,"cleaning was okay but could be better/the smaller bedroom on the streetside was very noisy/

location was great/communication with Andy and Check In very easy and good/"
4313059,439603863,4/19/2019,"The appartment is very well located and it is easy to park the car.
Everything was perfect!"
4313059,442345505,4/23/2019,"This home is in such a prime location for seeing a majority of the sights in Dublin! We found that everything was walkable from our Airbnb! Andy offered maps, tips, and brochures that helped us identify how to best spend our time in Dublin. Just be cautious of the bottom stair as its an older home and it has a bit of a slippery angle to it."
4313059,444036935,4/27/2019,Very nice and central location in a quiet street.
4313059,444834031,4/28/2019,"Location, location, location. And did I mention location. Great place. Accurate description. Easy communication."
4313059,445506319,4/29/2019,"Andy's home was in a great location - close to Brazen Head, Trinity College and walkable to pretty much everything which was nice. I did think the living area would be a bit more spacious and the home would be a bit more ""fresh""; also a bigger couch would be nice as seating 4 grown adults wasnt the most comfortable. There was a strange sewerage smell :/  Overall, the home served its purpose but personally wasnt ideal for our group."
4313059,447293709,5/3/2019,"An excellent place to stay. All was as advertised. The location is extremely central. The flat was clean, had reasonable crockery/ cooking supplies, everything worked well.
The only downside was that the smaller bedroom could be noisy if you have the window open which we did as it was hot. We slept well but if you were a light or sensitive sleeper you might find it noisy. The main room was fine. 
Otherwise this was excellent, Andy communicated well, and the location is great. I would recommend this Airbnb."
4313059,448607429,5/5/2019,This listing is all about the location. Most of the sights are within easy walking distance. The house itself is comfortable. Check in was simple. Andy left detailed instructions and recommendations for local attractions. I would recommended this place.
4313059,449751447,5/7/2019,"Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfy place near everything--walking distance to all Dublin attractions. Hot water, heating, and all amenities were great."
4313059,450437215,5/9/2019,Quaint 2 bedroom apartment. Close to the action in Dublin.
4313059,451223455,5/11/2019,"Andys place was in a great location and it suited us fine. Its pretty small but we spent our time walking around Dublin and not hanging at his place. Andy was thorough with his entrance directions and this made getting there and getting inside really easy. 

Also, the stairs are really steep so if you have mobility issues, you should look elsewhere as the second floor was really tight. My bride and I slept on the street side with the window cracked and it was pretty noisy for us. We woke up each night to drunk boys hollering in the street at 3a.m. and consistent traffic."
4313059,452958023,5/14/2019,Home away from home ! You can't get any closer to the city than Andy's place and it was so quiet at night which was great. I would definitely recommend staying here and checking in was very quick and easy. Thanks for having us Andy !
4313059,455901658,5/20/2019,Great place and perfect location! Highly Recommend! Brendan
4313059,457530257,5/24/2019,"We stayed for a few nights at Andys home in Dublin, amazing location and very clean. 

Just a block from Brazen head, finished our nights there with live music during our stay. 

Love the accommodation book, very helpful for house, restaurants, pubs, music, excursions and local etc.

Andy and Derek were both very helpful. Highly Recommended."
4313059,460006575,5/28/2019,Decent unit. Very convenient.

Andy had great suggestions of what to do in Dublin. 
The living room was great to sit in at night and reflect on the days adventures. "
4313059,464673420,6/6/2019,"Great accommodations.  Great location 10 to 15 minutes away from every major site.  Spacious house, so much better value than a hotel room/ suite."
4313059,467267982,6/10/2019,"Great location very close to Temple bar area and all the attractions.
Easy check in and was able to park on the street.
The floor in the upstairs bedroom has a soft spot and the stairs are a bit tricky so be careful."
4313059,470669260,6/16/2019,Ligging is prima maar te duur. Uitzicht naar buiten is er niet.
4313059,473171598,6/21/2019,"Excellent location, fast and good contact, convenient check-in and check-out, quite easy parking on the street in front of the apartment, taking into account location."

4313059,494954699,7/25/2019,Place was smaller than expected.  Second bedroom is very small.  We were there when it was really warm so we needed to have windows open and the noise was an issue.

This was my third time visiting Dublin and this was by far the best accommodations."

The house itself has a living room and a kitchen on the ground floor. Upstairs are the two bedrooms with a queed bed each. On of them faces the street, so you might hear possible noises outside, but not a big deal. Both bedrooms a very nice!"
4313059,562118163,11/10/2019,"A great place to stay for a trip to Dublin. This apartment was located in the heart of the city --  most major attractions were within walking distance.

4319495,446803037,5/2/2019,"The place is well organized, sparkling clean, has a friendly atmosphere and has many thoughtful touches to make your stay more enjoyable. Hosts are friendly, helpful and quick to respond to messages. The bed was really comfy and the kitchen was great. My one criticism is that the shower pressure isn't as powerful as I would like but it's not a big deal. The location is very convenient for getting into town. Overall, my girlfriend and I had a great stay and we would definitely stay here again."
4319495,451964330,5/12/2019,"Brian, Ronson and Juan's place was very nice and clean. They had tea and coffee for us. Check-in process was very smooth too, good communication. 

They were also very helpful in helping us travel around Dublin with their tips and detailed instructions. Really appreciated their eco friendly stand as well."

4319495,469305431,6/14/2019,"Very good stay, super clean room with a whole cleaning structure inside the house.
We had the pleasure of meeting the amphitheans, what an attentive couple. Our hospdagem was very good, we used the kitchen that can be shared.
Very good location, about 5 minutes from Boombridge (Luas) station which is 15 minutes from downtown.
We recommend it for sure, and will return to stay if necessary without thinking twice."
4319495,489706065,7/17/2019,Clean. Quiet area. Nice place to stay.
4319495,498211410,7/29/2019,"Guys whoever stays at this place can call themselves lucky! The host was super friendly, understanding, funny and caring. Whenever an issue came up they helped us out. Immediately. The bathroom was always clean and the bedroom was also clean. They even provided drinking bottles for during the day. Public transports were also close by so that reaching the city centre wasn't complicated to reach. If anybody is looking for a good time in Dublin and uncomplicated hosts should definitely consider this place. Also the facilities were always reachable for guests and the other rooms (dining, kitchen, livingroom) are also decorated familiarly and modern. We didn't happen to hang out in the garden a lot but once we did, and it was very nice to enjoy the coffee on the terrace. All in all, we had a great time there and you shouldn't hesitate visiting "
4319495,501998014,8/4/2019,"Lovely hosts who provided informative, prompt and helpful communication throughout. The room was clean, bright and just right for staying in for a few days. With access to a shared kitchen, shared bathroom and a short walk to the tram into the city."
4319495,509329841,8/14/2019,"It was a great, quiet location outside of the city with easy access to public transportation.  The room was simple and fine.  We were hoping to meet Brian and Ronson, but sadly they werent around."
4319495,524222157,9/5/2019,My parents enjoyed their room during 6 nights. The house is just 10 min walks from the Luas station which was prfect for easily going to the city centre.
4319495,525911480,9/8/2019,"Good location near the Luas stop. Loads of great recommendations for places to eat and drink and for live music, thank you for that!"
4319495,528552047,9/13/2019,"Unfortunately, and strangely (given the other reviews), our stay was definitely not as we expected. In our case, specifically, the room was not clean. We imagine that other stays have been much more ideal, however our room was unclean bordering on unhygienic - it was definitely uncleaned, or poorly cleaned, after the previous guests. After good communication prior to our stay, the communication regarding some issues that required resolving was poorer. The room was cleaned adequately, but other issues were eventually ignored. The lock on the room was broken, there were some wires exposed on the ceiling of the bathroom, and the pipe under the sink was leaking creating a little puddle under the sink. This, it was communicated, would be fixed, but none were. It seemed clear to us that the hosts simply didn't have time for the maintenance required with hosting an AirBnb accommodation. Furthermore, and this was our experience, they therefore definitely didn't have the time to create the coziness advertised - we didn't feel welcome to use any of the shared spaces, mainly because the other people living in the house barely looked up to say hello, definitely not up for a chat or offering any advice (as also advertised). After all, this is an AirBnb that we are paying to stay in, not a favour that is being done for us - and we certainly felt like we were a nuisance in this space. We spent quite a bit of time contacting the hosts and Airbnb support during this stay, and it definitely tainted our trip.

This is our first negative experience with AirBnb, and we are disappointed with how the hosts dealt with this after us raising our concerns after the stay. We have not received any communication since the second day of 4 (nights) of our stay.

Besides this, the location has a good connection to the city, and our bed was comfortable. It was one of the more affordable rooms we found, and if none of these issues existed it would definitely have been good value for money."
4319495,536779388,9/27/2019,"The house is modern with cool funky tasteful decor and is very clean and well looked after.The facilities in general were excellent and the room i stayed was spotless and very comfortable.The hosts were extremely warm and welcoming and very helpful providing directions to the house,information on the local area and recommendations for bars and restaurants and so forth.There were also nice touches like tea,coffee and cereal provided,fresh towels and free wi fi.
I would highly recommend this accomodation"
4319495,544072575,10/9/2019,"Overall this was a very disappointing Air B and B experience. 

My partner and I;
¢	travel extensively, 
¢	stay in Air B and Bs regularly, 
¢	are Air B and B super hosts in Canada,
and this is the only negative review that we have ever given.

Essentially, 7 St Finbars Rd is a boarding house. There were 8 other people renting space in this house and the owner/host lives off-site. We never met him or his partner, the other host. There are 6 permanent tenants who live upstairs and 2 Air B and B suites downstairs. The kitchen and laundry room are in constant use by all of these people.
The problems we encountered were as follows:
¢	The shared bathroom on the main floor has no ventilation and there is an overpowering smell of mould. The bathroom has no window or operating fan. The mould appears to be in the sub-floor level and everyone living in the house comments on it. The regular tenants use the upstairs bathroom. Both Air B and B rooms must use this bathroom. 
¢	We had only one meeting with a co-host. Juan briefly explained the house rules. We did not see the co-host again throughout our 4 day stay. We were not advised if we were allowed to use any of the common space.
¢	The bathroom sink did not drain. We advised Juan of this issue on the first day. For 3 days we brushed our teeth in the shower as the issue with the drain trap was not addressed.
¢	False advertising. The listing advertised that the hosts were a gay couple. This attracts people like ourselves. We are gay and were hoping to be in a home that was welcoming. Instead, we were 2 of 10 people in a small house where there was no communication between the permanent residents and the temporary (Air B and B) residents. 
¢	There were multiple posters and signs telling us the rules (eg. take out the garbage). But there was no attention to cleanliness of the bathroom or laundry area. No bath mats or towels were replaced throughout our 4 day stay (even through there was another Air B and B couple staying in the next room.
¢	The bed linens were threadbare and bleach stained. The pillows were ancient and lumpy.
¢	The 2 Air B and B rooms are aside the common bathroom and laundry. The Air B and B area (including the laundry and bathroom) is converted garage and the laundry runs constantly due to the high number of residents in this house. At times we would have to move the laundry racks and baskets just to enter our room, which was beside the laundry room. 
Overall, even considering the low price, this was our most disappointing Air B and B experience ever."
4322818,424232824,3/16/2019,I had my best Airbnb-experience at his house. It was lovely.
4322818,425460429,3/18/2019,We had a very nice stay for St. Patricks Day weekend at Rorys home! Rory is a really great and professional host.
4322818,427245295,3/23/2019,"Rory is a friendly, kind man.  Great conversation. Communication was great & he was very helpful when it came to making sure we knew when/how to get to the airport.  It would have been nice to have been provided towels,  instead of having to ask/search for them in the early morning hours.  Also was a bit odd that we were asked to take our rubbish away with us when we left. Otherwise, great stay."
4322818,429201297,3/27/2019,"Rory is an excellent host. Very nice, interesting to talk in a very nice way and gives you also good recommendations for the evening. The place is very nice, too. I'm sure I'll come back again"
4322818,430355604,3/30/2019,"It has been a pleasure staying and Rorys! I can definitely recommend him as a host! From my arrival to the mindfully prepared breakfast, it has been a five-star experience. Thank you, Rory!"
4322818,431037075,3/31/2019,Rory was a super host to myself and 3 friends - he couldnt do enough for us and made us feel incredibly welcome in his home. Its an easy journey from the city centre by DART to Killester and then a short walk to the house. Plenty of food and drink options in the Clontarf area too.
4322818,431577006,4/1/2019,Rory was a hospitable and very friendly host. His house is very centrally located in a lovely suburb and near to some nice restaurants and cafes. Would recommend
4322818,432933704,4/5/2019,Great stay!
4322818,435441413,4/10/2019,"Absolutely wonderful host that goes above and beyond.  Rory has lovely accommodation in a very picturesque part of Dublin.  His location is convenient for access to town and a Dart station only a short stroll from his house.

4322818,453260296,5/15/2019,"Rorys place in Clontarf could not have been nicer. He picked me up from the Dart station, drove me around where he lives, to show me the good places to have dinner and the lovely bay and park good for walking near his house.  The accommodation was quiet, and clean, and his morning breakfast was plentiful and tasty. One afternoon we had a lovely chat with tea and cake, and he even drove me to the airport. My stay at his house could not have been better. I highly recommend staying with him. The dart ride into Dublin is only 20-25 minutes."

4322818,483328175,7/7/2019,Rory was very welcoming when we arrived and he went out of his way to help us. He made our stay really enjoyable and it was the nicest cup of coffee we had in a while.
4322818,485173819,7/10/2019,"Rory asked us what time we expected to arrive, and we gave him a ballpark figure. After (Hidden by Airbnb) maps sent us on a circuitous route we ended up behind schedule by an hour, although his initial message didnt convey an urgency regarding arrival time. For this reason, we were very surprised to receive a call, in which Rory  came across as quite rude. When we arrived at his place we were prepared to cancel the booking had his disrespectful tone continued, but he requested that we forget about the call. While he was pleasant throughout our time at the Bnb, his initial contact coloured the rest of our stay with him. Other shortcomings, such as only one towel and one toilet roll being left out would have been completely forgivable, but we will not be returning specifically because of the issue mentioned above."
4322818,487780799,7/14/2019,Very nice
4322818,489204584,7/16/2019,"Rory is the best AirBnB host Ive had in two years of using the service. Super responsive when I was making reservations. Rory lives on site.

4322818,555039286,10/27/2019,Perfecte locatie in een hele nette buurt. De manier hoe Rory zijn gasten benaderd is fantastisch. Hij had tips en bracht ons (4 pers) zelfs naar de busstop en naar het station. Het allerbelangrijkst was voor ons dat alles brandschoon was!
4322818,558624171,11/3/2019,"Had a brilliant stay at Rory's. Very welcoming and easy to communicate with, served up a cracking breakfast too.

4368071,418090309,3/1/2019,"Siobhan is the best that can happen to you, if you'll stay for a few nights in Dublin. It was really a home away from home and I felt welcomed and secure from the very first moment. Her home is thoughtfully decorated, clean and beautiful. The breakfast is a special bonus to start your day right. The Luas is just a few steps away from the doorstep and also a walk down to the city takes only about 20-30 minutes. 
I hope to return one day."
4368071,419615170,3/4/2019,"Everything was fine! Siobhan was very friendly. Weve felt welcome.
Breakfast was made with Love."
4368071,422909331,3/12/2019,"Siobhan was such a joy during or visit. Her home is the perfect location- just outside the main city but right on the green line to head into town. You likely wont need a car if you stay here, unless you plan to drive farther out from Dublin. This area is very foot-traffic friendly. The cereal, bread, fruit, and fresh juice were the perfect way to start the day for us, and it saved us money on our meal budget. Our stay was in March, and the house can get very cold, but there is a heater in the room & Siobhan let us know how to turn it on when we were there. She also had a heated blanket in the bed, which was perfect! Rudy, her dog, is super sweet and loves a god scratch under the collar. This was our first trip to Dublin, and I cant imagine a better spot to stay."
4368071,426191827,3/20/2019,Siobhan has a wonderful and very clean house. The bedroom is huge and the bed is very confortable !! Thank you for your warm welcome and all the advices. It was for sure one of my best experience on Airbnb. The house is located in the north of Dublin but it's very easy to go downtown with the tram (about 15 min). We have appreciated the breakfast which was very good (with croissant !!). I can only recommend to go there !
4368071,430852699,3/31/2019,Siobhan is an incrediable host! Breakfast is delicious! :) Location is great. We highly recommend this accommodation. Thanks for everything! :))
4368071,432560370,4/4/2019,"The room was as pictured. Siobhan is a lovely host with a warm, inviting energy and I enjoyed chatting with her each time our paths crossed. The tram is about one block away, which takes you directly to the city center. You could also easily walk to or from the city center, which I did several times. As a solo traveler, I felt very safe both in the house and the neighborhood. Would 100% stay here again!"
4368071,434028676,4/7/2019,"My friend and I had a splendid time at Siobhans home. She welcomed us warmly and made us feel at home from the very first minute. Breakfast was wonderful, with berries and fresh orangejuice and so much more than I had expected. I would stay at her place again."
4368071,446426664,5/1/2019,"Siobhan is the consummate air bnb host and an excellent conversationalist. She goes above and beyond to make ones stay extra comfortable and special. Being¬†a dog lover Rudy made my stay even more homely.

I have stayed in Air BNB's throughout the world and have rarely come across such hospitality. I could not recommend Sionhams¬†place more!

Thank you Siobhan!

Anthony

4368071,449742723,5/7/2019,"Siobhan's place is a convenient Luas' ride from downtown. Her home is full of tasteful art, bright colorful decor with a large homey kitchen. Lovely plants grace the patio.  The bedroom room is large and very quiet, tastefully decorated and sparkling clean. We loved  it and hope to return when we visit Dublin!"
4368071,453297362,5/15/2019,"For my first experience of Ireland for 6 nights, Siobhan's home was the Goldilocks just-right choice. Historic interior architecture. Each private room and common living space contained artfully eclectic furnishings, books, print resources. The breakfast table was a particular delight ..fresh flowers, orange juice, croissant, yogurt+granola, fruit+berries cup. Thoroughly comfortable large bed. Modest interaction with pooch Rudi. Siobhan enthusiastically offers suggestions for walkabouts of any interest, especially music (at Cobblestone Pub near Jameson Distillery). +Do take the DART train out to Howth village harbor for the scenic cliff-side-trail trek to Baily Lighthouse.

Location! in a local neighborhood (Phibsborough) proved a unexpected bonus: my first night happened to be 'musical bingo Thursday' at nearby Downey's Pub (older boisterous inter-generational crowd), and next day by chance got a ticket to the sold-out Bohemian FC match at historic Dalymount Park ..followed by Guinness 'til wee hours at The Hut ..next days delicious breakfast or lunch at Woodstock or Kennedy's cafes. Note these are all within 3 blocks of Siobhan's  ..at this rate I'd never see central Dublin! ..but the Luas tram stop or bus stop is handily at the end of the block. The Botanic Gardens (+Glasnevin Cemetery) and River Liffey at O'Connell St might be a brisk '20min' walk (in opposite directions) ..but may also likely take an hour ..because one readily encounters Dubliners welcoming/initiating a 'brief' chat."
4368071,455109901,5/19/2019,We had a wonderful time staying with Siobhan. She was a local so knew exactly what to do and when. Our room was perfect and included little touches that meant a lot on our long journey. I would highly recommend. I felt at home even though I was many miles away.
4368071,457566369,5/24/2019,"Siobhan was the nicest AirBnB host I've met! She was very welcoming, knowledgeable of the area and helpful for a first time visitor. Very quick to respond and happy to help. Her place is very nice, she set up an amazing breakfast every morning and made sure I was well looked after with lots of little extras in my room. It had the service of a 5-star hotel with the feeling like I'm staying with friends or family. Quick 20 minute walk to the center. Her dog Rudy was very friendly and a great addition."
4368071,458760212,5/26/2019,"Siobhan offers hospitality and her special touches will make your stay more than comfortable. Delightful energy and a beautiful space. The shower has plenty of hot water and great pressure, she provides a beautiful spacious bathroom and 1/2 bath close to your room. Best Airbnb experience Ive had."

4368071,478787156,6/30/2019,"Good stay during one month for studies in Dublin. There is all the necessary equipment for computer and mobile connections, chargers and adapters available on site . The host is very fine."
4368071,482424429,7/6/2019,Siobhan is truly a special soul! Our stay was incredible! She welcomed my mom & I with coffee/tea/cookies.  Made sure we were comfortable and gave suggestions on our couple of days in Dublin. She was very thoughtful and welcoming. Highly recommend! Thanks Siobhan!
4368071,484083304,7/8/2019,"Shioban is a lovely and engaging host. Her pup Rudy is friendly and easy-going. The breakfast is yummy. The bed and linens are comfortable.  The shared bathrooms arrangement works just fine, so don't let it deter you from booking."

4368071,490355483,7/18/2019,Our host was spectacular! She was so helpful with helping us get around the city. Lots of great suggestions. Will definitely come back someday and stay with her again. Made us feel right at home and her dog Rudyù was adorable. Made the transition from leaving our pets that much easier.
4368071,510054453,8/15/2019,"I cannot express how grateful I am to have stayed at Siobhan's house.  She welcomes you with a smile and makes you feel at home.

We will definitely stay at Siobhan's house again :)"

Our room was extremely clean and comfortable, and we loved all her thoughtful touches. Siobhan would lay out lovely breakfast foods for us each morning, and went above and beyond in assisting us with our needs.

If I have a chance to come back Dublin, I must choose her house again.
Great location, clean room, fresh breakfast!"
4368071,525102135,9/7/2019,"A warm, inviting home, a beautiful bedroom (and bathrobes!), freshly squeezed orange juice, homemade granola and warm scones in the morning, and most important, a lovely, kind and caring host. And a friendly dog! What more could you ask for? We loved our stay with Siobhan!"
4368071,533348301,9/21/2019,"It was a graet pleasure being guest in  Siobhans wunderful house , I felt almost being at home. Everything was perfect, very cosy room,  great breakfast, Food shops and public transport nearby but also  very easy to walk to the city centre.  Siobhan welcomes her guests with valuable tips in Dublin and surroundings. Highly recomended !!! Thanks, Siobhan"
4368071,535426039,9/24/2019,"Siobhans place was a gem! Perfect distance away from the city center and close to public transportation. Space is clean and stylish, plus Siobhan goes the extra mile to provide breakfast goodies every morning. Siobhan was an extremely kind and welcoming host. She greeted us when we arrived and went through a map of local sights. We really enjoyed our stay! Thanks a million, Siobhan and Rudy :-)"
4368071,537210192,9/28/2019,"From the first point of communication to the very end, Siobhan was an amazing host! She was kind, thoughtful, and generous.

Her home is spotless, beautiful, and located close to everything we needed and wanted. We parked our car on her street, as it was a very safe neighbourhood, and we decided to walk everywhere in Dublin. Though not in the central area, all the places we, and any tourist would want to go, was approx 20-minute walk away... and you're walking through some great neighbourhoods so it doesn't even feel that long. 

Breakfast was delicious. A combination of fresh pastries, fresh berries, freshly squeezed orange juice, and a warm cup of tea/coffee was the start to a great day. Her handwritten note what is also very thoughtful.

Siobhan and Rudy her dog, tops the list of great Airbnb hosts, and we've had many!"
4368071,538663264,9/30/2019,"Our stay at Siobhan's place has been simply one of my favorite Airbnb experiences to date.  

We stayed in the downstairs room; we were the only guests during our stay, though there is another room available on Airbnb.  Our room was very clean, the bed and pillows comfortable; amenities included not only clean linens and towels, but also slippers, bathrobes, and a USB plug (for charging phones from abroad!).  The bathrooms, though technically shared, were sparkling clean as well.  Siobhan had also provided a thoughtfully-annotated book of recommendations for the surrounding neighborhood as well as the city.  

The location is not downtown, but it is about a 20-minute walk through some lovely neighborhoods or an even shorter tram ride to get to the city center.

Siobhan herself was the highlight of the stay.  She was warm, friendly, and engaging to converse with--truly a kind heart who made us feel at home.  We enjoyed all our morning chats with her in her cozy kitchen, over delicious, freshly-prepared breakfasts.  Her dog Rudy was also sweet and very well-behaved.  

In sum, if you like clean, homey spaces and heartwarming hosts, you would be hard-pressed to find a better stay than Siobhan's home."
4368071,539871090,10/2/2019,"Siobhan is a very welcoming, warm, thoughtful and enthousiastic person. She made us feel at home straight away. The bed in the backroom sleeps great and we loved her bedding. The breakfast provided in the morning is delicious and a very nice gesture.
Going from Siobhans to the city center is only about 10 min by tram. On a bright day it's a 20 min walk. For us the location was great and as a bonus it saves you a lot of money not to stay in an expensive hotel in the city center. 
Thumbs up for Siobhan!"
4368071,544997906,10/11/2019,"I have stayed in many an Airbnb and this was far and away one of my absolute favorites if not my favorite (and I've stayed in a mansion with a large group of friends before lol).  Siobhan's house is more than just a house -  it's a home.  This fact is evident the minute you step into the threshold and are greeted with a warm genuine smile, a thoughtfully decorated interior and a furry tail wagging to greet you.  It was a treat to feel so at home when you've been on the road like I have for a bit!  There is beautiful art that is a feast for the eyes on the walls; everything is decorated with such thought, care and love!  

Her dog, Rudy, is adorable; shy at times and a giant love bug.  A much appreciated bonus was hanging out with him and chatting with Siobhan over cups of warm tea!  The living space is super cozy and cute to boot!

Breakfast is PERFECT and delicious!  I even left early one morning for a tour and she kindly prepared it for me the night before to be ready in the morning, freshly hand made orange juice and all!

If you want to stay in Ireland and get a feel for the country, culture and stay in a home this is absolutely the place for you!  While not in the city center its location is perfect!  Easy public transportation will get you to the heart of Dublin in 10 to 15 minutes as the tram is RIGHT next to her home.  It was everything I could have wanted and more. 

Thank you so much for a lovely stay and it was such a joy meeting you!  I couldn't be more appreciative or happy I stumbled across your listing."
4368071,553140326,10/23/2019,"We had a really pleasant stay in Dublin and it was partly due to Siobhan's kindness and hospitality ; probably one of the best hosts I've ever met through Airbnb ! We felt like at home from the second we got in her cosy appartment, where everything is exactly as described in her summary. She was most particularly very accomodating with us and full of good advices for making our trip enjoyable, and really discreet also for a shared flat. Therefore, we definitely recommand her place for your short-stay terms in Dublin. Thanks again for everything Siobhan !"
4368071,561891312,11/10/2019,"I stayed in Siobhans home for four nights with my boyfriend in November. We had a lovely time staying with her, she is a caring and thoughtful host who goes above and beyond to make you feel very comfortable. Her home is clean and warm, in a nice area of Dublin with good access to public transport and not too far a walk from the city centre (20-30 mins). When we arrived Siobhan already had the electric blanket on for us and offered us a wide selection of teas. Every morning she prepared a nice breakfast for us so we could start each day off well. She provided lots of local tips and knowledge and answered any questions we had. We had an amazing time visiting Dublin -and staying at Siobhans (and meeting her sweet dog Rudy) - definitely played a big part in this! Would recommend to stay here when visiting. Thank you!"

4368210,425531845,3/18/2019,"We had a really nice stay during St. Patrick's Day weekend. We could reach temple bar by feet and even a taxi was cheep going there. The house was cozy and I really liked the area. Supermarkets are just a small walk away. The only thing that was missing is a hair dryer and when asking for it, it was just said there isn't one. But overall it's a great place to stay in Dublin."

It is spacious, clean and well maintained. The 2 bedrooms are large and comfortable and the onsite laundry room, with brand new washer and dryer, make daily living a breeze. The fridge freezer is also nice and big. The owner also included  many welcome gifts and thoughtful touches.

The area is also amazing. The building and grounds are well maintained and quiet. Its also lovely how little children play together, in the gardens, during the day. It is 15 minutes from the airport and right beside the train station, which takes you all over. The village is walking distance to the village for all your necessities.

My absolute favourite part of our stay was the proximity to Newbridge Farm! As a runner I could run the most beautiful paths woven through the farm. The farm also has farm animals and a gorgeous Downton Abbeyù manor house which can be viewed by guided tour.

I simply cannot say enough about this owners attention to detail and the value for money that this accommodation offers. 

We would stay there again and again and thank Niamh and Jeff for their hospitality."
4372717,533335478,9/21/2019,"Loved our stay here! We were very comfortable and cozy. The open kitchen and the balcony would be my favourite part of the place. The neighbourhood was nice too, pretty close to the supermarket and the train to the city. The backyard was nice as well, we were able to skate around and my little sister even made some friends. Would stay here again for sure!"
4378260,419562754,3/4/2019,"Helenas place is perfect for solo travelers! The room is cozy and has a very homey feeling. The apartment is super clean and has a nice modern look to it! Location is absolutely perfect and convenient. Id never been to Dublin so this was one of my main concerns, but I had no trouble getting around. Its near 2 train stations (I believe Heuston and Connelly). And bus stops as well. Temple Bar is about a 12min walk. Christ Church and city centre were I believe 14min walk. If you have (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps on your phone, you can get just about anywhere you want from there, whether walking distance, bus, or train, itll tell you where to go. There is a grocery shop right across from you (1 min walk). And theres a little bistro right below your apartment with great food, as well as other restaurants in the square. Helena was super chill and helpful with my questions! I recommend her place 100%!"
4378260,421910293,3/10/2019,I was in Dublin for the weekend and this was a great place to stay. The location was perfect. My flight to Dublin was delayed but Helena was flexible with the check-in time which was really helpful!
4378260,431629132,4/1/2019,"Helenas place was great and it has Ams amazing location!! Not only was Helena a lovely host and every responsive, but I also felt very at home there!

4378260,444818525,4/28/2019,"I had to find a room at the last minute. Helena was quick to reply, helpful, and flexible about letting me drop off my suitcase early as I rushed off to a conference. The room is small, as advertised, but perfect for one person for a short stay."
4378260,450101531,5/8/2019,Nice for woman traveling alone to stay at Helenas home
4378260,454483042,5/18/2019,"The stay at Helenas place was very comfortable and felt like home directly! My plane got delayed but she was very flexible and communicative and waited up for me until after midnight!
The room is small but the bed is extremely comfortable and the place is very clean. Thank you Helena!"
4378260,459427575,5/27/2019,"Great location - handy for the LUAS and for buses (including the Airlink bus serving the airport, for 7 Euros one-way or 12 Euros return), and near the Liffey so it's easy to navigate back when walking around the city. Secure, gated complex, so felt very safe. On the square are several bars and cafes, also the Lighthouse cinema which shows art-house as well as popular films. Opposite is a food shop called Fresh, where you can buy a takeaway box of lovely salads, sold by weight, which you can mix and match yourself, and can add things like chilli & lime chicken. There are tables and chairs if you want to eat it there, or take a walk down to the river. The cutlery that Fresh provide is plastic, so not good if you're into recycling - maybe they'll change to wooden cutlery one day... Helena is a great host, friendly without being intrusive, and easy-going."
4378260,483244477,7/7/2019,Quiet and cozy. Worked well for me.
4378260,499416799,7/31/2019,"I recommend this place. Photos are what you have to expect.

The house is really clean in a quiet place, well located in few minutes of big commercial street."

Thanks Colman."
4391824,425919770,3/19/2019,Can't stress enough how AMAZING this place is. The location is pristine and close to so many great restaurants and bars. The rooftop terrace has a gorgeous view and the space is huge!! 5 of us fit more than comfortably. Colman was wonderfully helpful and met us upon arrival and helped us through check-in. Absolutely loved it and would 100% stay again.
4391824,430347124,3/30/2019,"The apartment has everything you need, and the location is perfect - literally in the center of Dublin, you have everything accessible (Tesco Express supermarket right in front of the house, and Tesco Metro - which is cheaper - is 5 mins by foot; bus /metro stations are not far, but you can basically walk everywhere). If you travel with heavy bags, the stairs might be a problem for you, but for us it was fine. We really enjoyed the hosts hospitality and quick replies."
4391824,434106688,4/7/2019,"Unbeatable location in Temple Bar, with The Porter House just crossing the street.  Colman friendly welcome us to check in and gave us a solution to leave our baggage untill our departure. Very comfortable beds. To repeat any other time in Dublin."
4391824,442744732,4/24/2019,"The location of this place is perfect. Smack bang in the middle of the best area in Dublin. The only issue with this is that the street did get a bit noisy with drunken revellers on the night we stayed which woke us all up. But overall it was a small price to pay for such a great apartment. It's spacious, well equipped and I was very impressed with the towels. There were loads and they were really big and good quality. Much better than you would expect in a short term rental."
4391824,443585692,4/26/2019,"Excellent accommodations, great location next to temple bar, great host, just remember a lot of stairs to front door."

In the apartment is everything you need to have a mice trip."
4391824,449688878,5/7/2019,"Awesome host!! 

He assisted with our luggage.  He also left a very very nice Irish breakfast in the fridge for us which was an awesome surprise and friggen delicious the next day!!

The location was perfect for us.  No matter where you needed to go, we always found ourselves close to home."
4391824,450089235,5/8/2019,Colmans place is perfectly located to explore Dublin and Temple Bar. Colman allowed us to check in a bit early and provided us a spectacular breakfast for the morning. We 100% recommend Colmans place.

4391824,453628387,5/16/2019,This is a fabulous Airbnb find. The location is superb and the hospitality warm. This quaint flat is full of character (including the rooftop patio!) and may be the best location in the lively Temple Bar district. And don't even get me started on the generously stocked refrigerator.
4391824,458773512,5/26/2019,"Everything was so nice, as expected! Thx alot"
4391824,460097169,5/28/2019,"Fantastic stay! 
Our flight arrived early on a Saturday morning, before the 2pm check in but Colman was brilliant! He was easily contactable (which I was nervous about as hadnt been to Dublin or used Airbnb before) and he let us leave our bags and take a key so we could go back later. 

Location was brilliant, 5 minutes from
Temple Bar! The apartment was spacious and perfect for the 5 of us for the weekend. 

The little touches like fresh flowers and breakfast in the fridge were a lovely thought and very well received. :)

Thank you!"
4391824,492291135,7/21/2019,"This is a charming flat, located right in the heart of the action in Dublin.  Colman, our host was extremely hospitable and made our stay outstanding.

We are thinking about coming again next year!"

4391824,514019454,8/20/2019,"The flat is in a great location in Dublin's Temple Bar neighborhood, with lots of really good restaurants nearby, as well as being a short walk to Dublin Castle. Colman was a great host and the flat was clean and comfortable. If visiting Dublin again, I'd definitely look into booking the same place."
4391824,521041808,8/31/2019,Colmans place is very close to the River Liffey on one end and to Trinity College on the other.  We had only a five to ten minute walk to get to so many places. Colman provided  a nice store of food to get us started and tea as well as granola and coffee.  He also carried our luggage up the five flights!  Thank you.  There is a nice rooftop deck too. It needs some work but we still enjoyed it!  Thank you Colman!

4431096,440121128,4/20/2019,"Marta and Kevin were wonderful hosts - I had a tour that ran over by an hour so I ran late to the check-in, but they were great at keeping in communication and figuring out a way to check me in despite the change in plans. We had some wonderful conversations as well which made me feel right at home despite being a first-time solo-traveler to Ireland.  The location was extremely convenient, I was able to easily catch buses and navigate to anywhere in Dublin. I highly recommend their place for any solo-travelers to Dublin."
4431096,441945751,4/22/2019,Marta e Kevin sono persone gentili che ti ospitano con grande cortesia.. casa localizzata a 30 minuti a piedi dal centro ma in quartiere tranquillo e con locali..
4431096,445450607,4/29/2019,"Marta & Kevin were amazing hosts, very friendly, kind, helpful and flexible, everything was so easy.

4431096,451179775,5/11/2019,"Marta & Kevin were amazing hosts! They were very friendly, kind, and flexible. My flight landed extremely early in the morning, and they worked out a plan that allowed me to stop by before check-in to drop off my bags so I didnt have to lug them all over the city my first day. Their place was great, very well connected to the center and not far from the main attractions, clean and comfy. Their dog Lola was so friendly and cute! They made me feel right at home despite being a first-time solo-traveler to Ireland, and a first-time airbnber! I couldnt have picked better hosts for my first airbnb booking!

Lola is one of the friendliest dogs I have come across and an absolute darling! I highly recommend this place and look forward to staying here again.
Cheers!"
4431096,561952228,11/10/2019,"The room is bigger than expected (by reading other reviews I have imagined it smaller) even if it is on the small side, but the bed was confortable, the temperature was perfect and there is everything needed in a room. Everything in the house was perfectly clean. The position in just outside the city centre, within a brisk walk on 25 min, othersiwe the bus stop is just around the corner with several buseds to the city centre. A lot of bars and supermarkets nearby. Kevin and Marta were very nice and friendly and I have enjoyed my stay in Dublin. Highlight definately is Lola, the cutest and sweetest dog!"

4445391,422906816,3/12/2019,"First thing I must say..the place is beatiful, clean and on good spot! Bus stop, tram stop, railway station is just 6 minute away. And cherry on top..Ej is just great host! Always nice to us, helpful and really kind. We had as much privacy as we needed. I really recommend this place!"
4445391,435088007,4/9/2019,"Very nice flat in a good location - near you can find a bus and tram station. Ej is a kind person and a good host. We were satisfied, everything was great."

4445391,455040745,5/19/2019,"Ej really offers a beautiful accommodation in a prime, very quiet location. In 3 minutes walk you are at Heuston Station - from here buses go in all directions. Two nice bistros and a supermarket are just around the corner. It's just the perfect place to explore Dublin - thank you so much, that we were allowed to be with you!"
4445391,483250351,7/7/2019,"Nice and modern apartment, Ej was very kind. Everythings like you see it on the pictures, 30 walking of the city center.

4445391,555213027,10/27/2019,"EJs place was a great find. Not too far away from Dublin city center a 25 minute walk to downtown and a train station right across the street! His home was beautiful and stylish and wonderful to come home to after a day of exploring.

Our only suggestion to future vacationers is to not have a car in Dublin. Free parking is difficult if not impossible to find. It would be easier to just explore on foot, bus or train."
4445391,564576434,11/16/2019,"Great location, close to Heuston Station,  trains, buses, trams and very handy to the CBD.

Ej is very informative and prompt with his replies. Would definately recommend a stay here"
4446134,545483550,10/12/2019,Great place to stay outside Dublin. Easily reached by transit
4446326,454890896,5/19/2019,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4470132,421811366,3/10/2019,"The flat is correct and clean and very well located buses are just in front of the flat and you are at less than 10 minutes from the town Center. 
The only negative point was the shower we had hot water for less than 10 minutes and we had to put it on 20 minutes before taking it. 
It was a bit short for two peoples.
We had difficulties with the heaters too but Bernard helped us quickly."
4470132,425922642,3/19/2019,Really small house with no control of the heating sistem which lead to period in which the house was cold plus 20 minutes waiting for the boiler to heat water for a shower. Host punctual in replies to questions and gave useful informations. I appreciated the free coffee in kitchen. Good location well-linked to the city center.
4470132,435099284,4/9/2019,"I writing this as an experienced host and traveller. I booked a room for 2 nights, drove from wexford to visit my sick mother in hospital, locked myself out of my room on the second morning, I had to go upstairs where the landlord Bernard lives and ask for spare key, he seemed very agitated, he unlocked and barged in, walking around, he spotted my dog lying on the couch trow over, and lost the head, using bad language and aggression. No way could I stay another night,. Its a tiny bed sit which is way over priced, no radio TV, no room to swing a cat,no double lock, didn't feel safe leaving belonging there. Cracked door, where it had ovbiously been kicked in. Hot water only lasted 5 mins after an hour wait . I told him if he had a problem with pets just don't advertise, to which he hung up the phone after more cursing.  I'm not one for confrontation, but there was no talking to this man. Enter at your own risk."
4470132,442306436,4/23/2019,"Nice and clean apartment, very well connected to the center of Dublin. Bus stop right in front. Shops are very close, and also some restaurants. Host was great, and the building is very quiet. The garden is also nice. We stayed here with our one year old baby and the apartment had everything we needed."

4470132,461940596,6/1/2019,Bernards place was in a great location with a bus stop directly in front and plenty of food and beverage options near. Also he offered free washer and dryers which was great.
4470132,469202482,6/14/2019,A tiny 1 bedroom apartment in a great location. I strongly advise the owner to wash the towels and bedsheets thoroughly with soap and hot water. Be aware that you'll need to wait at least 20 min to take a warm shower.
4470132,483040643,7/7/2019,Friends loved it would recommend to anyone
4470132,512404490,8/18/2019,"Bernard was friendly and accommodating of my early check-in request.

The place is small but comfortable enough. I was able to cook meals in the unit. Transit options were fantastic there, and it was also easy to walk to many places that interested me."
4470132,534093620,9/22/2019,Unfortunately the apartment did not live up to our expectations and the host did not respond to our queries once we had arrived.
4470132,535750221,9/25/2019,"Great location - public transport /bus stop literally across the street, plenty of place to dine within a block or few.
as described"

4470152,459366383,5/27/2019,"Great location and local amenities, good resteraunts and pubs. Surprisingly quiet on the back over looking the garden"
4470152,465812663,6/8/2019,"Great great location, and very relaxing space. It is my second time visiting this bnb."
4470152,483326423,7/7/2019,We had a good stay at Bernards place. Very good host. He was present while we checked in. Communication was good. Overall for a short visit it's nice. Room is a bit small but I guess most places are like that. Location is excellent. Very well connected with local buses.
4470152,517133067,8/25/2019,Muito bom...recomendo...
4470152,521066319,8/31/2019,"Nice litte appartement. I had my peace and quiet - however Bernard is available if needed. But normally everything is self-explanatory. I liked my way into the city by foot - otherwise buses are available (bus stops just in front). Loved having a vegan restaurant right next to the apartment.
Garden and washing rooms are available as well - but not used by me as I packed correctly for one week.
Would go there again :)"
4470152,529988266,9/15/2019,"Bernard's place was cozy and convenient. It was small, as other reviews have described, but it was exactly what we needed and was excellent for the price. We spent our days exploring, and we were happy to have a place to come back to that felt safe, homey, and accessible. The shower was hot, the bed was comfortable, and the location was surprisingly excellent. It may seem a little far from the city center on the map, but it was across the street from a bus stop that takes you right to Temple Bar and beyond. It is a lot more peaceful than that area, while also still easy to get to. You can walk into Portobello, which has great food and drink, and there is a grocery store half a block away from the flat. I would recommend this place as a fantastic jumping off place for exploring Dublin, while also having a place to get some peace and rest."
4470152,542357384,10/6/2019,"Bernards place was perfectly located in Rathmines, close to all amenities you would need like restaurants and supermarkets.

The bus stop is right in front of the house and you can get to the city center in few minutes.

Bernard was very kind and swapped our room to another one he had available which would fit us best as we were travelling with a baby and a few bags!"
4472358,431009986,3/31/2019,I had a really nice stay! :)
4472358,444017989,4/27/2019,Good place to stay if youre in Dublin. Good location to travel quick in to the city for a great price. Also Laura and Liam who live there are very nice people and welcoming. Thanks for the nice stay!

4472358,501375526,8/3/2019,"I stayed for two weeks in Valerie's house. I met her and her family only a couple of times, as they don't live there permanently. They were really nice and helpful. 
Her niece Laura and husband Liam live in the house and are very nice as well. There is a busy road in front of the house, to which the only window in the small room opens. Due to the pub on the road you will enjoy conversations of the drunks returning home. Thin walls, banging doors and a very ""loud"" and uncomfortable mattress do the rest. 
All in all a very nice and lovely accommodation, just not the right place to stay if you're expected to be fit for work every day. Maybe better for tourists."
4475964,460917966,5/30/2019,"A brilliant place to stay, better hospitality than a 5*, great location, and excellent value."
4475964,469233015,6/14/2019,Sehr zu empfehlen!
4488728,439121843,4/18/2019,"The apartment is really comfortable and there is everything you need. On top of that, it is super easy to take a bus into the city centre which is not far away."

4492472,479691309,7/1/2019,"Jims place is perfect. Hands down recommended! Jim was extremely hospitable, place was squeaky clean and fantastic located. Really comfy bed and brand new amenities. Jims place comes highly recommended for  your local Dublin staycation!!"
4492472,500035760,8/1/2019,Very resonable price in this city and nice local tips!
4492472,505518810,8/9/2019,Jim has a nice and cozy house in a quiet part of town but within walking distance to the city centre. He has been nice and helpful and fun talking to over breakfast. Can highly recommend staying at his place.
4492472,508114046,8/12/2019,Jim's place is great. It's in a quiet neighborhood but close enough to the center with a walk. The room was very large and bathroom clean and updated. Jim is a nice person who takes care of his guests. Would recommend his place to others.
4492472,512520501,8/18/2019,Everything was great in the house. Thanks Jim for your hospitality. I hope I come back soon.
4501804,434102792,4/7/2019,Couldn't have got better hospitality.
4501804,440192929,4/20/2019,A great place to stay. Raquel and Ruben provide the most comfortable bed and were all around so incredibly helpful. I really wish I had planned to stay for more than 1 night as they truly made me feel at home. Would recommend to any and every solo traveler!
4501804,492524249,7/21/2019,"Great communication 
Lovely home
A little farther away from the center if town but in a nice area"
4534566,482317866,7/6/2019,"Great location- close to LUAS, Dodder river park, nice coffee shop and small supermarket. Nice back patio."
4534566,519231874,8/28/2019,Clara's place is really great and spacious. We loved our staying and would definitly stay there again.
4548861,533344954,9/21/2019,Very clean and comfortable. Easy to get to city centre. Enjoyed the stay.
4603955,508742795,8/13/2019,A comfortable house in a convenient area both from the airport and to the centre.
4604580,425416486,3/18/2019,"Conor and Ann were the perfect  hosts! They welcomed us with great hospitality and with kindness! We had a amazing time in Ireland and had the chance to truly relax during our stay at their place. They really gave us a beautiful and quiet environment to enjoy our stay. They helped us with the public transports, they shared good tips with us about the area and about Dublin, they prepared a convivial breakfast every morning, etc. We are really grateful and we highly recommend to stay there for a good time in this splendid country!"
4604580,452452064,5/13/2019,"We stayed with Connor and his wife for three days. It was an absolutely pleasant stay. Connor is such an interesting character with so many stories to tell. We also loved their dog Nina. Howth is definitely worth visiting and Sutton is just a walk away from everything. We can totally recommend staying with Connor and Ann if youd like to visit Dublin, but you also enjoy the more rural areas around Dublin."
4604580,454069258,5/17/2019,Staying with Conor was everything we wanted - a relaxed and calm place after sightseeing with good chats and lots of information and tips. I would prefer staying in Howth/Sutton over staying in busy Dublin - it's pretty easy to get into the City Centre anyway and takes about 1 hour with walking and public transportation. And I can really recommend the seafood restaurants in Howth and the Cliff Walk.
4604580,459372322,5/27/2019,"My Grandma and I stayed with Conor for three nights as we wanted to explore the Howth peninsula. He gave us the warmest of welcomes! He picked us up from the busstop upon arrival and, for a small fee, even arranged to drop me off and bring my Gran (who doesn't speek English) to the airport when we checked out - this saved us a lot of time and stress and it worked out beautifully. The room was nice and tidy and had plenty of room to put our stuff. I had lovely chats with Conor and his wife but they also gave us enough privacy in the evenings to relax. Their dog Nina is probably the most well behaved dog I have ever met, very calm and friendly.
The only thing I would maybe adress is that if you are a very clean  person, you should be aware that there is a shared bathroom. It was okay to use, just if you are picky about these kind of things, be prepared that it won't be absolutely spotless at all times.
If you are looking for an affordable cozy place to stay in a wonderful calm area near beautiful hiking spots and with a warm and welcoming atmosphere - this is the place to be!"
4604580,460799015,5/30/2019,"Conor and Anne were excellent hosts! They were full of information on the local area and it was fascinating speaking with them about their own experiences around the world. We loved their dog Nina who was very well behaved. The room was fantastic and the place itself sits just outside of Dublin (probably some 20-30 minutes by public transit, less by car... depending on traffic). Its the perfect place when you want to stay near Dublin, but don't want to deal with all the traffic and noise of the city! You're also right next to Howth, by about 15 minutes of walking, which comes with excellent seafood and hiking trails.

Thank you for the great stay Conor and Anne!"
4604580,465666124,6/8/2019,"Connor and his wife Ann are great! They have such a nice place in Sutton to spend your hollidays outside Dublin and it is much better than spending your time in the hotel. Connor picked us up from airport at late night and it is very much appreciated especially when it's your first time in Dublin. Very cosy place, breakfast, shower, nice room with two beds. It was nice to talk to Connor about the places to visit, and to listen some stories about him and his lifetime. Connor was very helpful with ordering a taxi for early morning events. There is nice place called Houth in the east from Sutton you can have nice time to spend for sightseeing. Thank you Connor and Ann for your welcoming and care!
I wish you good health and the four-leaves-clover luck in your pack :)
Best regards
Definitely recommended to stay at Lawsons'."
4604580,468733182,6/13/2019,"Conor's home is clean and comfortable.  The location is great for taking public transit to Dublin, Howth and the airport.  He is a wealth of information and is very interesting to chat with. The hike in Howth was one of our favorite things."
4604580,472658765,6/20/2019,You can expect a very friendly welcome together with a comfortable stay. We enjoyed our trip to Ireland and would highly recommend staying with Connor!
4604580,474744300,6/23/2019,Conor and Ann are wonderful hosts and really made me feel at home. I had a lovely time. The area is great for walking.
4604580,481240163,7/4/2019,"It was unforgettable staying with Conor, Ann and their wonderful family. The cottage is in a quet and peaceful area. Our room was very light, cosy and clean. Conor is so helpful and ready to answer all  questions. His sense of humour is great. We liked talking with Conor at breakfast time. And we also liked Nina, a smart and well-beha ed dog. We want say many thanks to Conor, Ann for their hospitality, kindness, useful advice. Thank you that you made us feel at home! Higly recommend staying in this place."
4604580,484635116,7/9/2019,Staying at Conor's place was the perfect touch to visiting Ireland. He and his family were extremely welcoming and were willing to go out of their way to help out. They had a lot of great recommendations and local tips for getting around. The area around Sutton is very beautiful and you are still very close to Dublin. Highly Recommend.
4614940,422555818,3/11/2019,The contact with Bernard was easy. The location of the place is really good and in a safe area.
4614940,440697706,4/21/2019,"Bernard's place is as advertised. We stayed in #4 on the main floor. The apartment is dated but in good condition, Bearnard explained how everything worked and it was a good place to sleep after our adventures out. It was clean and has bus stops right outside to get to the city center. There are also really good restaurants near by if you do not want to go into the city."
4614940,449354640,5/6/2019,Bernard's place is located in a lively high street at walking distance from the centre of Dublin. The place itself has everything you need for a short stay and has an amazing back garden that must be lovely during the summer. Bernard is very nice and quick to respond.
4614940,457146769,5/23/2019,Bernard is a very warm host. He went out of the way to ensure our comfort and readily accommodated our requests. Cheers.

Great hospitality"
4614940,484086143,7/8/2019,"We booked a studio flat and got 1 bedroom apartment. Great location, Bernard was very helpful."
4614940,501333763,8/3/2019,"Our stay was much better than expected. The apartment was well equipped, and very liveable even with the small space. The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is fantastic: bars, pubs, restaurants everywhere. Shops are cca. 20 meters from the apartments, so we could also do our own shopping. It was great."
4614940,523338406,9/3/2019,"A comfortable and tidy little apartment in a great location, with everything you could need within 300m. Having basic supplies provided was welcome as we'd just arrived from the US, but especially important to us was that Bernard allowed us to have our tortoise and cat stay, too."
4614940,529884503,9/15/2019,"Apartamento muy cerca del centro por lo que si te gusta caminar un poco, no hace falta coger autobus para nada. Nosotros cada noche a la zona de temple Bar y por el dia a todos los sitios andando. El apartamento muy simple pero ideal para lo que necesitamos."
4614940,534003365,9/22/2019,Perfect place to stay if you want to spend a lot of time experiencing Dublin. Effective use of space and super clean! Great location.
4614940,536816184,9/27/2019,"really, really clean. feels way more like a little hotel suite than an apartment."

4630976,425447812,3/18/2019,Simon's apartments were clean and tidy and are in a wonderful location in Dublin. He was responsive and even came late at night to provide a spare key! Would stay again.
4630976,428513462,3/25/2019,The apartment is in a great location and beautifuly decorated. I really recomend it. The host was very professional and helpful. I would keep this property in mind next time I am in Dublin.
4630976,448556736,5/5/2019,"The apartments are like the photos in the adv. Great location, you can walk to reach all the main attractions. Simon always available to reply to your questions."
4630976,454968662,5/19/2019,Mooi appartment op loopafstand van het centrum.
4630976,460412316,5/29/2019,My husband and I and our five kids had both apartments for three nights. A fantastic location right off St Stephen Green and we walked everywhere! The kitchen/common areas were spacious and attractive. The beds were comfortable. Two bedrooms downstairs and one upstairs and couches on both floors. Our six year old liked sleeping on the couch. We booked the trip last minute but Simon was very helpful and responsive and got us a great taxi driver from the airport.
4630976,480283407,7/2/2019,"Simpn's place is very cozy and charming, with an extremely convenient location.  Just steps from St. Stephens Green, a convenience store, breakfast spots and a couple pubs right below you.  We felt very much at home there.  Simon was extremely responsive and Fabi (the woman who checked us in) was very warm and welcoming.  We hope to be back some day!!"
4630976,481792687,7/5/2019,"Great location, clean, with great communication with our host, Simon. It was a convenient location for us. Beds were very comfortable and breakfast as well as dinner right across the street."

4630976,506276606,8/10/2019,My family of 11 people were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations that Simon provided. Exceeded our expectations and Simon was a gracious host!
4630976,515594646,8/23/2019,You can't stay in a better apartment in Dublin! Location is amazing - right on St Stephen's Green park and 5mins walk from Grafton street. There are 4 coffee shops right below the apartment which means you can go down in your pajamas and buy great coffee and pastries for breakfast! The apartment is two separate units which made it perfect for our stay. It is the apartment with the best amenities that we'veever stayed in. And on top of that it's been decorated in a really beautiful and stylish way! Simon was a very helpful host and accommodated all our special requests! I will recommend this apartment to anyone going to Dublin and will definitely stay there again!
4630976,524710742,9/6/2019,"Simons two apartments were perfect for the four folks in our group. The location is wonderful - everything you could want is within walking distance.  
Simon was also very helpful with tips. Would definitely stay here again."
4630976,530034569,9/15/2019,Simons place was perfect in every way.  Location cannot be beat!  Comfortable beds...such a beautiful apartment...we almost hated to leave in the morning.  Great communication and easy check in.
4630976,532797388,9/20/2019,"I booked Simon's property for some US friends who were visiting for my daughters wedding.  From the outset, Simon  and his property manager, Fabi, were very responsive, confirmed our booking and stayed in contact right throughout the booking and check-in process, evening allowing my friends to drop off their luggage early while the property was being cleaned.  The property itself is excellent and the location in the centre of Dublin could not be better....everywhere is within walking distance and you have endless number of great pubs and restaurants on your doorstep.  I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone who is visiting Dublin."
4630976,535783290,9/25/2019,great place

4630976,555228121,10/27/2019,"Simon and Fabi were super helpful and great at communicating. The flat was in a great location, however the 1st floor apartment was very small, which is just something to be aware of for groups of 4+."
4630976,558586558,11/3/2019,Simon came to the rescue when our original apartment cancelled last minute. Excellent location and property. Highly recommend
4630976,562690790,11/11/2019,"Simons place is in such a great location right around all the tourist attractions, restaurants and bars! It was very comfortable and clean. I stayed with a big group of people and there are actually two apartments on separate floors so that was very nice having different bathroom and kitchen spaces for the group. 100% recommend staying here!"
4650114,425522387,3/18/2019,Big appartment in the center of Dublin. Good communication with Michael.
4650114,428577405,3/25/2019,Very helpful hosts arranging great accommodation in perfect location!
4650114,439061140,4/18/2019,"Great location in Dublin! The apartment is close to public transportation, if youre looking to visit other places in Ireland. Michael was very helpful in letting us know which bus to take to/from airport and had great suggestions!"
4650114,444714033,4/28/2019,Wonderful apartment situated perfectly for enjoying a stay in Dublin.
4650114,446389109,5/1/2019,"My boyfriend and I stayed here when we came to Dublin on vacation. The location is great! It is right next to the river, temple bar area, and a lot of the popular sights. The host let us in the air bnb a few hours earlier than the set check in time so we could store our luggage. He responded very quickly when we had any questions. I would definitely recommend this place! Thanks for a great visit!"
4650114,450033616,5/8/2019,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Dublin and in this apartment. The location is fantastic, just above a Tesco for snacks and The Celt for all of your pub needs. Public transportation is just down the street, and the shopping is great. The apartment itself is very cute and is a very good size. It could use a few updates in the bathroom and the bedroom, but overall we had no complaints. The walls are thin, so do expect some nightly noise being in the city. Thank you, and cheers!"
4650114,451259401,5/11/2019,"Nice flat, clean,good location and Michael was always ready to respond"
4650114,455913708,5/20/2019,Perfect location! Easy walking distance to everything. The apartment was spacious and had many amenities. Fun view of a busy street to hear the hustle and bustle.
4650114,463427838,6/3/2019,"A fantastic, safe location. Airport bus comes to the street and a Tescos below is super! A 5 min walk to main street of city is perfect."
4650114,467377041,6/10/2019,"Just back from a great trip to Dublin and delighted with our choice of accommodation.  From the minute we booked right through our stay both Michael Michael and Marie couldn't have been  bigger help with great simple instructions to get us where we needed to be.
Check in was short and sweet - everything explained well so all we could've asked for.
Had a slight issue where no iron could be found but Marie appeared with one promptly- could ask for anymore.
Top tip - breakfast across the road and the Wooden Whisk, although a little pricey is excellent 
Will definately book the apartment  again when I'm back in Dublin "
4650114,468835574,6/13/2019,Location!  Only a couple blocks from the pole in the holeù or the spire.  Also 5 min walk to green line or red line of the LUAS stops.  So if looking for a budget place close to city center this is it.
4650114,476086498,6/25/2019,"Great central location within walking distance to shopping, 
site-seeing and restaurants . The apartment is very big with a well equipped and stocked kitchen. My only criticism would be that some of the furnishings are a bit shabby and the archaic hot water delivery system ( The hot water is on a two hour switching system which is this day and age is not very good, if. situation"
4650114,478867272,6/30/2019,I was staying with a friend for 4 days at Michaels. The appartment is nice and the basics are there. Dont forget an adapter! Location is just great!
4650114,480757350,7/3/2019,"Michael was very accommodating to work with as we were checking in from an early flight.   Even though it's on a busy street, the bedroom is in the back so you don't hear a lot of noise.  The pictures of the bedroom were a little nicer than the room was in person."
4650114,487695539,7/14/2019,"Peaceful and quiet, yet in the middle of it all! This was a great find in Dublin. Just off the main areas, yet quiet as could be. Convenient location to anything we wanted to do, whether on foot, bike, bus, or train (and we used all four in one weekend - even kayaks!). The flat is situated in the heart of the city, yet feels miles away when youre inside. The open dining/living/kitchen area made for lovely leisurely mornings people watching as I enjoyed my breakfast, and the location of the bedroom in the back of the house ensured a peaceful nights sleep. There are a few minor signs of wear and tear around the flat, but it felt like home. All the amenities I could ask for. Hope to visit again in the future!"
4650114,491537589,7/20/2019,Great location.

Cons:  the actual apartment had dirty carpets, bathroom bins not emptied and didnt feel clean. In a questionable part of town."
4650114,518779377,8/27/2019,Shabby but not chic. But the location is very convenient - close to the Spire and the river.
4650114,529215994,9/14/2019,"A truly fantastic location, very close to many of the Dublin attractions and with everything we needed."
4650114,538084031,9/29/2019,This apartment was centrally located and clean. The host was friendly and the place was a great bargain for the location. This was worth every penny :)
4650114,540353492,10/3/2019,"Michaels place was such a great location, close to OConnell St in Dublin, with lots of options for bus service. The apartment was also very spacious for 2 people, but some upgrades in the flooring & bathroom could be considered. We appreciated hearing back from Michael immediately whenever we contacted him - such a friendly host - thank you!"
4650114,543166458,10/7/2019,Bed linen could have been a lot better.
4650114,544570814,10/10/2019,The apartment is in a good location. It is right in the CBD. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go. Our host Michael was very attentive and our stay was terrific. I found a Coffee Cartel coffee van in the next street that made good coffee and was only a short walk away.
4650114,552768340,10/22/2019,Great location to explore Dublin. Clear instructions and had everything we needed
4650114,558827900,11/3/2019,Great place in the heart of Dublin. Could not have asked for more. 10 out of 10 will revisit.
4650114,561355100,11/9/2019,"This place is the best! You cannot beat the location, which is central to literally everything you want to do in Dublin. Getting to and from Dublin airport and other cities in Ireland is super easy because everything is located right around this area! Highly recommend."
4665890,419982118,3/5/2019,"This review is actually of Rathmines Apartment 3, even though we were booked for Apartment 1. Elaine was easy to communicate with, and quickly met us at the apartment to let us in. The accommodations were accurate with the listing for Apartment 3. Everything was clean, and Elaine left us some goodies and breakfast items which was very much appreciated! While the Apartment is about 20-30 minutes from the city center, we preferred to stay in the suburbs which is why we chose this apartment. It was great to walk through the neighborhood and see how the locals live. The luas is a short 7 minute walk which takes you straight to city center. The only frustration with the apartment was the extremely spotty, and sometimes non-existent WiFi, which is hard as an international traveler to not have consistent WiFi in the Airbnb. But otherwise a fantastic place and we would stay again!"
4665890,420980252,3/8/2019,"Elaine is an truly amazing host. She welcomed us warmly and responded to every question within minutes. The location is perfect, there's a Tesco (supermarket) right in the proximity. Transport to the center is at a 10 minute walk, so going/returning is very simple and fast. The bed was super hiper mega comfortable and the apartment is so cosy and warm.
Definitely the place to stay if you're going to Dublin.
Thanks again Elaine, we may return to Dublin."
4665890,424263807,3/16/2019,This apartment was the best bag for your buck! It was just outside city center with easy bus access. Elaine was a very welcoming host providing us some treats upon arrival. It was the best airbnb we stayed at in Ireland!
4665890,429928288,3/29/2019,"Elaine's place was amazing! She met us in person to check us in, walked us through the space and even had some groceries for us during our stay so we wouldn't have to worry about breakfast. It was a great space, comfortably fit our group of 4 (two couples) with a great living area. The TV was a tad small, so we couldn't watch any movies together, but that wasn't an issue for us. 
It was right on top of a pharmacy and convenience store, so very easy access to groceries and toiletries, if needed. Within a 15 min walking distance were plenty of shops, restaurants and a movie theater. There was secure parking a couple blocks away for our rental car, and the city center was just a short drive away.
Overall, loved our time there and would be more than happy to stay again, should we ever be in Dublin!"
4665890,434636037,4/8/2019,"Cozy, warm, well connected, highly recomendable"
4665890,435434821,4/10/2019,"We enjoyed staying here. Good location in south Dublin, 12 minutes to LUAS and buses on the street or the next street. Elaine was responsive and helpful to messages. It was easy to meet Elaine as she works in the chemist downstairs. The flat is good, modern and well equipped. Bedrooms are not on street so good and quiet."
4665890,454052019,5/17/2019,"This is a very stylish apartment, comfortable beds and living space.  Elaine was a great communicator, and there was a lovely welcome food pack  - tea, coffee,milk, sugar as well as eggs and bread for breakfast.  Lovely toiletries in each bathroom. There was plenty of information about pubs, restaurants and things to do.  Easy transport into Dublin.  Highly recommended."
4665890,461309640,5/31/2019,"Apartment 1 Rathmines exceeded our expectations.  Elaine is a terrific and hospitable host.  The apartment has modern amenities and is spacious, clean, and stylish. Location is terrific."
4665890,526683119,9/9/2019,Great place to stay. Would recommend. Very friendly and informative.
4665890,551387966,10/20/2019,"Very flexible host, even provided a pack-and-play for our toddler. The location was easily accessible to the city center by bus. Great for a long weekend! Thanks, Elaine!"
4665890,560613951,11/7/2019,Spacious 2 bedroom apartment and well heated in winter! Fully stocked kitchen so we were able to cook dinner each night which was appreciated. Right on a bus route so it was easy to get in and out of town.
4665890,561977970,11/10/2019,"Fabulous weekend staying at Elaines apartment. Great location, near to restaurants, bars and shops but nice and quiet for a good nights sleep. Prompt communication and the welcome pack was much appreciated. We will definitely book again when we come back to Dublin. Many thanks!"
4665890,569039908,11/25/2019,"Great location and amenities and the flat had pretty much everything we needed for our stay. Elaine was a great host, on hand nearby for anything we needed but not at all intrusive. The only thing I would say is that there were were four of us staying there and we could have done with another sofa in the living room, but that's obviously not something that would bother everyone."
4723246,425507426,3/18/2019,We had a great stay at Bernard's
4723246,451933384,5/12/2019,"Great place to stay while in Dublin. It's very convenient and accessible, and the apartment is nice and comfortable."
4723246,459348437,5/27/2019,"Great location and price. Place was very clean and organized. The hot water only lasts for a few minutes so you have to be quick, but I knew that before reserving it so it was fine."
4723246,467917790,6/11/2019,Highly recommended. All my family stays at Bernards when they come to visit me in Dublin and everyone has been happy every time
4723246,470410392,6/16/2019,"Basic space, no frills, but all you really need when touring Dublin.  The location is quite nice and walkable with many conveniences nearby including groceries, restaurants, transportation, pubs, shops, etc.  Only down side was the the wi-fi was little bit spotty for watching Netflix. But the host was very responsive in resetting every time. I highly recommend if you are not looking for a fancy deluxe room."
4723246,478763517,6/30/2019,"Bernard is a great host, very helpful. Super location in the heart of Rathmines. Thanks, Bernard!"
4723246,508174858,8/12/2019,Bernard is an amazing host ! Very kind and accommodating. Helped us to start our trip on a good note ! Place was spotless clean and comfortable. Was able to walk to Dublin city center from here. Would definitely come back and stay here.
4723246,527695635,9/11/2019,"Location and transportation from the flat to the city center are so good, even tho I referred to walk almost any bus from the location stops in major highlights of the city. The boiler as mentioned is for quick showers only so if you are the type of person who needs a long shower after your day this is not the location for you. Very limited amount of electric socket if you are a gadget kinda guy like myself you need to calculate properly because of only one bedroom and 2 in kitchen. Other than that all was great would recommend this place to anyone who is visiting for short term visit."
4723246,543288341,10/7/2019,Bernard made everything easy and convenient.  Would highly recommend this location!
4728250,421392527,3/9/2019,Had a great stay at Edel & Gerry's! Clean and well located apartment in the center of Dublin!
4728250,423151485,3/13/2019,"Great location! Shower is the only thing I can complain about the water wasnt that hot. There no shower door. Bathroom was cold well we showered. Other then that, place was great. If we had a problem, they were quick to respond. I deal Place for a vacation. Walking distance to everything."
4728250,426182002,3/20/2019,"Perfect location!  The flat is comfortable and great hosts w quick communication. There is some street noise in the bedrooms, its a big city so that cant really be helped. We would definitely stay here again.  Thank you!"
4728250,431963229,4/2/2019,Very good location and very nice apartment.
4728250,434609947,4/8/2019,"The apartment was clean, secure, and located in a great spot. 10 or 15 minute walk to most major tourist locations and sites. Corner market, lots of taxis, and directly across from some great history. The only thing that could be improved would be shower pressure. We were told that it was normal for Dublin (Website hidden by Airbnb) We had a great experience! Would definitely stay again."
4728250,435768545,4/11/2019,"This spot is secure, safe and very central to everything you need or want to see in Dublin. It's near bus lines and in walking distance of many attractions. It's near beautiful Christ Church which is a wonderful sight to see as you leave the airbnb each day. The amenities are great, with a full kitchen! We loved staying here and hope to do so again!"
4728250,436519216,4/13/2019,"The location of Edel & Gerrys place is beyond amazing and the beds are extremely comfortable! Their place is nicely furnished and the apartment/building is clean and secure. 

The only downside I have to say is the water pressure in the shower. It would be a strong trickle at best so if you appreciate a good strong shower, youll be left disappointed."
4728250,437891598,4/15/2019,"Great base for exploring the city. 

The apartment was exactly what we were looking for, somewhere comfortable just a short walk from the city centre (10mins to temple bar).

Would definitely recommend."
4728250,440758866,4/21/2019,"The best thing about the rental is the location, and it is very clean with a great kitchen. 
We were expecting everything to be pretty perfect based on what we were paying and the photos but there are a couple things that would have been good to know about the amenities:
The shower pressure is very, very weak. This is not something the support team could really fix, it's the shower itself. I mentioned this to them early on, but had a slow response, which was ultimately not addressed because we had a bigger issue of the living room heater not working during our stay...
There is no fan in the bathroom (and as you can see no windows)
The TV is not the one pictured- it is a small, ""unsmart"" cable/antenna-ed TV.
And as stated- we had problems with the living room heater (it stopped working altogether the last two evenings of our stay.) I reached out to the support team and they did try to help but because it was a holiday weekend, but were not able to get anyone into the place before we checked out. They were super friendly, but because we had a different representative every time I called, it wasn't the most helpful at times. 
Other than these things, it is a comfy, clean space in a great spot. Also want to add that the support team tried to make up for some of the short-comings by being accommodating about late check out. They also let us have an early check-in, which was really helpful for our travel schedule."
4728250,443552838,4/26/2019,Great location in the city center. Host is quick to respond and was really helpful.
4728250,444766955,4/28/2019,Great place! The location was very convenient and easy to get wherever we wanted to go. Little store on the corner we could walk to stock up on some snacks and everything else was a walk or bus ride away.
4728250,447937985,5/4/2019,"We booked this accommodation as a last minute trip to Dublin and we couldnt have found a nicer place to stay! There was 4 of us staying in the apartment and everything was as described. Comfy beds, clean towels, a nice shower with plenty of hot water and no issues with the appliances, which you tend to find in some places! Location is perfect, about a 10 minute walk to Temple bar and everything else not too far. Communication is great with very quick response times should you have any issues or questions. I would highly recommend staying here!! Thanks again Edel & Gerry :)"
4728250,451962703,5/12/2019,"Fantastic location! The place itself was really clean and had everything we needed. The area itself was quiet, close to a soar for supplies and exactly what we were looking for!"
4728250,453212126,5/15/2019,"Great location, amazing kitchen, and very safe complex. Our only issues involved finding the keys initially, and communication with the host. These were minor, and solved quickly. Id highly recommend this apartment."
4728250,460523253,5/29/2019,"Great location!  Central to so many things & an easy walk.  Great kitchen and well stocked, had everything we needed.   As others mentioned, shower pressure was low & some street noise in bedrooms, but still very comfortable stay - highly recommend!"
4728250,465828892,6/8/2019,"Good apartment in a great location, super easy walk to downtown and airport bus."
4728250,468858322,6/13/2019,"This apartment exceeded our expectations.  I grew up in Dublin and know the city very well.  The location of this apt. is within walking distance to everything you want to see in Dublin and far enough away from the noise of the night life of the city.  Apartment was spacious, clean and matched the online description.  The hosts were accommodating, courteous and responsive.  Check in was simple."
4728250,473173789,6/21/2019,"Great location and great hosts.

A small issue with the washing machine but communication was easy and the issue was rectified."
4728250,476450327,6/26/2019,Very nice apartment! Enough space for everybody and nice kitchen :) the beds were a bit uncomfortable but the couch was super soft and amazing! We had some issues with the bathroom sink though :) all in all a very sweet spacious apartment
4728250,481625387,7/5/2019,"Edel & Gerry's place was a great find.  Although it's in the city centre and so close to Dame Street, it's in a very quiet complex so there was no issues with street noise at all.  It was very clean and tidy.  Two good sized bedrooms with storage.  The kitchen and bathroom have everything you need.  We got on street parking outside the complex easily each day.  An ideal place for a Dublin city break."
4728250,489266426,7/16/2019,"Edel&Gerrys apartments was perfect for our stay in Dublin. Check-in was very easy, great communication.
The beds and sofa bed were both clean and comfortable. The apartment was very clean. There was tea bags and lots of things in the kitchen if we needed, which was nice touch. The shower was great! 
The location is very good all the restaurants is like 70m from the apartment. 
I would recommend for future guests. 
Thanks for having us, see you soon !
Odilon"
4728250,498866295,7/30/2019,"Great location, beautiful apartment, easy check-in, and overall clean. Our only issue was that the water in the shower did not drain fast enough. We communicated with the host but the issue was not resolved. I would not disarrange anyone from selecting this place."
4728250,500025254,8/1/2019,"The beds and linens are perfectly clean, we all really appreciated that during our stay but I must say the shining star of this place is the amazing location! Thanks Edel and Gerry!!"
4728250,503656103,8/6/2019,"The place was fine, the location was really great."
4740598,421823904,3/10/2019,Very cool and central....a comfortable and clean house....thanks a lot:)
4740598,425508060,3/18/2019,"Nice, lightly rooms, enough for 5 ppl!"
4740598,427975819,3/24/2019,"The Check-in prozess was without any problems. We get the key from the key box. In front of the cottage is a primary school and on week days it is loud sometimes.
The cottage was very nice, but for 5 people it is a little bit small (because only one toilet and shower) and the appartment was not very clean. 
Still we enjoyed our weekend with great city trips."
4740598,433951355,4/7/2019,"Great location close walk to Jameson distillery which was close to the transit
Quiet location and excellent eateries 
Again thanks Keith"
4740598,437128749,4/14/2019,"A lovely, clean place to stay with great access into the city centre. The check in process was very easy, and Keith sent some useful guides and tips for the local area and the house beforehand."
4740598,441942352,4/22/2019,We had a great time at this airbnb! Checking in was easy and Keith gave us some nice recommendations. Everything was really clean and enough space for 6 people. We would definitely stay here the next time!
4740598,448634233,5/5/2019,Very cosy and clean apartment!
4740598,455160866,5/19/2019,"Great location, lovely house."
4740598,458682862,5/26/2019,Very nice house in a central location to accommodate max 6 people. Keith was very friendly and helpful in providing all information needed. I would definitely book it again and recommend it to Dublin visitors :)
4740598,460487107,5/29/2019,Keith is a very attentive host. His place is a great budget place for a family of 4 or 5. Supermarket is nearby. The place has everything you need for cooking and even a washer.
4740598,465828026,6/8/2019,Keith's place was very clean and worked great for 6 adults.  The location worked perfectly for us.  We would stay there again.
4740598,469733572,6/15/2019,"We liked the location of this home, which for us was walkable to Dublins attractions, but out of the tourist fray."
4740598,471846262,6/18/2019,A very clean and nice cottage in a secure area.
4740598,474538050,6/23/2019,"Fantastic location, close to town and the local area has so much if you didn't fancy going too far. Accomodation was great, hd everything you wanted and more. Definitely worth considering this place again in the future!"
4740598,480775841,7/3/2019,We had a great time at Kirwan St. Many fun places close by and a reasonably short walk to city center. Also spent a day in Malahide which is easy to get to by bus or taxi. Highly recommend making time for the castle/gardens there and meandering through this cute coastal town.
4740598,484761553,7/9/2019,Great place for friends to stay at! Not noisy and not far of a walk to fun places.
4740598,488668155,7/15/2019,Keiths place was wonderful! Clean and a great location near shops and pubs in Stoneybatter.
4740598,490331697,7/18/2019,Great location- walking distance to all the sights- its a nice neighborhood- good vibe
4740598,494410104,7/24/2019,"House was great...near enough to public transport, was very clean and modern looking, every accessory possible was there and working. Bedding was super comfy. Only negatives would be that living room (alongside main bedroom) was upstairs, with bathroom, kitchen and twin bedroom downstairs, so it was a pain if you wanted to relax in living room but had to grab everything from kitchen downstairs. Also, I think we were there on the hottest day in Ireland, so had to open all windows which couldn't stay open so we had to use boxes to wedge them open with - however I don't think anyone else needs to worry about that unless you go in a heatwave!"
4740598,497247446,7/28/2019,"Great location, walking distance to everything. Really comfortable and good lay out for a few friends. Would definitely recommend."
4740598,498740358,7/30/2019,Access was super easy with the combination lock box. The instructions and tips sent beforehand were very helpful and Keith was very responsive with answers to questions.
4740598,508692643,8/13/2019,"Residential area, so relatively quiet with a grocery store and pharmacy near by. Check in was a breeze. It was very clean and organized, but didnt have any cozy touches like a real home would (it was quite bare, and a little spooky). The beds were surprisingly comfortable, and it was overall a very good stay."
4740598,518285645,8/26/2019,"Great location, comfortable and clean space."
4740598,520451612,8/30/2019,"It's a great place, good accommodation with enough space also for families with children. The close neighborhood offers some really nice places for breakfast, lunch and  evening party and it's close but not too close, so great balance. Nice walk to beautiful Phoenix Park and Jameson Distillery and plenty of bus connections to Temple Bar if you don't fancy a walk. Keith was a very helpful host. I recommend this offer 100%"
4740598,521907777,9/1/2019,"Stayed for two nights as a group of 5 whilst visiting the city. Really nice space, everything was as pictured and the flat has good links into the city - tram/bus/walk are all possible.
Having one bathroom was a bit of a squeeze with five people but manageable. Check-in was super easy and Keith had even sent us a few guides of the area before we got there. Definitely recommended."
4740598,528084572,9/12/2019,Cosy house in a really good location
4740598,534111200,9/22/2019,"Lovely quiet place in a friendly area near to lots of great places to bisit. Good local pubs, cafes and restaurants.  House was perfect."
4740598,535891115,9/25/2019,"This beautiful and cozy cottage is located in one of my fav locations in Dublin.- really easy to walk around and about 15min walk from town. The house is spotless clean, has good ventilation and yet nice and cozy."
4740598,536763127,9/27/2019,"Had a great stay! The place was lovely and we were thankful to stay there. The place is a tad bit out of the way, so be prepared for a 10 minute walk to the center of town, or use a taxi!"
4740598,538118779,9/29/2019,"This cottage is ideal for a weekend visit to Dublin. My friends and I had a lovely stay here to celebrate a birthday and were delighted by the location and the comfort of this accommodation, how perfectly equipped the kitchen, bedrooms and lounge are, the nearby cafes (particularly Slice, which is 2 mins walk from the house) and how easy the communication with Keith was. We were also charmed by the friendliness of the Dubliners! We would highly recommend this cottage."
4740598,546222600,10/13/2019,"Property as described.  Great location and quick responses from host.
Great stay."

4742157,419644170,3/4/2019,"Such a lovely place to stay. Paul is a great host. He gave us a lot of intormation and tips on what to do. Beds are really good, rooms are clean
 Location is not too far from city center, but enough far that you can see a different, more slow paced and local side of the city. Over all Lost Boathouse is a great choice if your coming to Dublin."
4742157,422557952,3/11/2019,A lovely house and garden in a quiet area near pubs and shops and at a walking distance to town.Spacious and clean rooms and kind hosts. Who could ask for more?
4742157,426212095,3/20/2019,Paul was very helpful with location suggestions and spots to check out. Went above and beyond my expectations. Incredible stay!
4742157,428582390,3/25/2019,"This apartment has everything you need for a trip to Dublin!
Clean rooms, a lot of space, nice interior, quiet side road and you feel welcome from minute one.
Paul has a lot of information about restaurants, travel opportunities, sightseeing, shopping and Dublin himself.
We really enjoyed our stay and would do so again."
4742157,434034697,4/7/2019,Paul and Steven are very good hosts. Loved our stay in the lost boat house.
4742157,438619668,4/17/2019,We had a wonderful experience at Paul and Stephens home. They were an absolute pleasure and the rooms/bathrooms were so clean and comfortable. The location was perfect also. Just a quick Uber/cab ride into the heart of Dublin and walking distance to shopping and restaurants. I only wish we had stayed longer!
4742157,442396406,4/23/2019,Beautiful space. Lovely garden. Fantastic hosts. We had a wonderful time here!
4742157,445504564,4/29/2019,"Paul and Stephen are great hosts and the house is a great base for anything you want to do in Dublin, especially the south side of town."

4742157,468318489,6/12/2019,"We stayed for 3 nights with 2 adults and 4 kids and had a brilliant time. All three bedrooms are very clean, stilish and comfortable."
4742157,471328344,6/17/2019,"Beautiful and very clean home located in a quiet neighbourhood just outside the city centre.  We enjoyed A relaxing coffee in the morning with the view of a beautiful very well maintained garden. 
20 minute walk to Dublin centre through the park with lovely cafes and restaurants on the way which we enjoyed a full Irish breakfast before touring the city centre. 
Paul was very welcoming, polite and informative and helped us on our way to tour the sights of Dublin. Thank you. 
We all had a lovely relaxing visit in your beautiful home."
4742157,474752878,6/23/2019,"Excellent accommodations: clean rooms, clean bathrooms, nice sheets and pillows.  But most of all, Paul is an outstanding host."
4742157,478890396,6/30/2019,Paul and Stephen are very nice hosts. Perfect stay in a nice quite place.
4742157,485642756,7/11/2019,"We finished our vacation at Paul and Stephens home.  What a perfect location, walkable into downtown, restaurants, as well as on the edge of a beautiful park.  We appreciated the hospitality and the hosts had great suggestions for our family.  It was a great way to end our trip."
4742157,492509419,7/21/2019,"Paul and Stephen were really kind! The house was clean and near the city center. Thank you for everything, we really appreciate it!"
4742157,501070469,8/3/2019,"We - 4 adults and 2 children - felt at ease from the very first moment at the hidden boathouse. Stephen and Paul are outstanding hosts who really care about their guests. We loved the house, exquisitely furnished and very well kept, the rooms including a private living room, the wonderful garden, the fresh eggs from the own hens for breakfast, the Ringsend area with the possibility to play football and the good bus access to the center. Everything was great! Ursula and family"
4742157,503733659,8/6/2019,"You can expect a good time in the house, quiet place, approx 25""walk to the City Center."
4742157,505508929,8/9/2019,"Paul & Stephen were amazing hosts and have a beautiful home to offer for visitors looking for a balance of convenience and comfort. Our group of three couples found the place very inviting. We wish we stayed longer. This was the first time we ever stayed in an Airbnb that was also owner-occupied, and it had all the perks without any of the potential downsides. We had our private space and they had theirs, yet they were able to provide advice and local insight that we wouldnt have gotten otherwise. For example, we arrived pretty late and still hungry for dinner; they are so familiar with the local eateries that they were able to advise us of our best options. Paul even provided his tablet to help with our search. They have been doing this hosting thing for so long that they know how to put on all the finishing touches. 

You have your own bedrooms, bathrooms, a living room with comfortable seating & games, a dining area, breakfast prep area including mini fridge & dishware, and access to the yard. 

Overall, it was a fantastic stay, very quaint, and we cannot thank Stephen & Paul enough for giving of their time and energy to help us make the most of our stay."
4742157,511538330,8/17/2019,"All I can say is, Wowù! We were completely satisfied with our stay at Paul's lovely home. In all ways it exceeding our expectations. Paul and Stephen were gracious, courteous, knowledgeable hosts. We always felt comfortable while we were in their home. They both were accommodating, patient, and kind at all times. They provided guidance and lots of tips on where to go, and what our options were. Their home is beautiful! There was a common guest room where we could gather. It was comfortable, nicely appointed, and had lots of conveniences so that we could be together with our family and friends staying in the home. The bedrooms were warm, cozy, and stylishly decorated. The bathrooms were top notch.

One of the unexpected pleasures was the ease with which we were able to get around. We never expected that a short walk through their lovely neighborhood park would connect us to convenient services and transportation. With our LEAP cards we were able to get anywhere in Dublin and the surrounding environs easily. I would recommend Paul's Airbnb to anyone."
4742157,515023680,8/22/2019,"Exquisite home, superb hosts"
4742157,517211476,8/25/2019,"The stay at Pauls and Stevens beautiful apartment was very pleasant. We (five persons) felt very comfortable during the four days and we missed nothing, Paul and Steven are super nice and affectionate hosts. They are cooperative and helpful. Questions and messages in advance were answered immediately.  Everything was very clean, cozy and lovely decorated. The beds in the upper floor are very comfortable, the two bathrooms are modern and spacy, even the hairdryer had some real power! the beautiful, sunny guest lounge downstairs offers enough space to sit, relax, have some lunch etc. We used the bus, which is 8 min walk away, to get to the city center. 

I would definitely recommend the house and Steven and Paul as hosts!"
4742157,519235647,8/28/2019,"This house is comfortable, quiet and beautifully ornate with a private outdoor garden, thoughtful amenities and amazing hosts (the space is shared with them).   Our family of 5 stayed here for three nights and there was plenty of sleeping and resting space (even to ""office"" and to do school work).   It was easy access from the airport with only a 15 minute walk to their place.  Of note, the common guest lounge had all the essentials, which we used for enjoying light breakfast and take out dinners, but there was not access to a kitchen or sink downstairs.   There is a small fridge and microwave oven.  Paul was thorough and responsive in communication.  He provided outstanding recommendations  (best Thai food we've ever eaten) and great advice about the area.  Well recommended!"
4742157,523677830,9/4/2019,"Excellent location to Dublin, very clean, Paul and Steve are very good hosts made us very welcome"
4742157,531354422,9/17/2019,"Super host, very nice and clean home."
4742157,538922104,9/30/2019,We really enjoyed our Time at the Boathouse. We stayed there as a Family of 6 and had everything we needed. The 3 Double rooms where amazing and the Livingroom had everything we needed for breakfast. The communication with Paul was always quick and easy.
4742157,540393595,10/3/2019,"Stunning home. The attention to design- and need-details was top notch. When we first arrived in Dublin we stayed in a centrally located hotel. We then spent a couple weeks touring the country and then returned to Ringsend. So relaxing, but it also allowed us exercise time as the walk in to town was brisk and exhilarating in the October air, but very doable. Beautiful grounds, wonderful hosts."
4742157,543258980,10/7/2019,"Great host , lovely place to stay ."
4742157,546241861,10/13/2019,"Paul and Stephen's place is wonderful and they are really great hosts -- gave us lots of helpful advice about what to do and see in Dublin & how to get there from the house. The rooms were all comfortable, the breakfast room was especially nice for our whole group to congregate in. The neighborhood is a little bit outside of the downtown area, which was nice for my family to have a cozy quiet spot to rest. Between the lovely Ringsend park & great local neighborhood-type pub they recommended, it felt set apart from the rest of Dublin in a really nice way"
4742157,548338375,10/17/2019,"Paul and Stephen have a very nice place to stay, Well equipped, Nice and cosy and very clean."
4742157,556409837,10/29/2019,"Loat Boat House was actually easy to find. And it was easy to get there by public transport late in the night. It is close to bus station so hosts gave us Leap cards with some money on it.
Maybee you see as a minus liveing with hosts but this was totally fine. Paul and Steven have great advices about atractions in Dublin or other parts of Ireland, or renting a car, and they keep house very clean."
4759699,419064700,3/3/2019,This airbnb is in the perfect location if you are looking for a weekend trip to the Temple Bar area. We loved just being able to step outside and get to the city center in under 5 minutes yet still had the peace and quiet of the apartment complex for relaxing nights. The room was spacious and clean with a really comfy bed and even a dish of chocolates to welcome us. The hosts could not have been more welcoming and have great suggestions for places to do and things to see in Dublin!
4759699,422012371,3/10/2019,Good central location for exploring Dublin and nightlife. Host communicated well and was kind. Check in/check out was easy. The only downside was the cost versus cleanliness factor.
4759699,425496125,3/18/2019,Quite easily the best Airbnb weve ever stayed in. We were greeted with a couple of pints of Guinness and Irish whiskey and plenty of great recommendations of bars and restaurants. The hosting couple were extremely accommodating and kind. It was the highlight of our trip.
4759699,427861173,3/24/2019,Great location in the middle of Dublin. Nikola was a lovely host.
4759699,440812826,4/21/2019,"The place is nice, Nikola is very firandly and helpful! The location is perfect, close to almost everything in the centre! :)"
4759699,444776832,4/28/2019,"First off the location is amazing, we were able to step out and immediately be in the heart of the city. For this alone we believe it was definitely worth the money for how much we saved on transportation.
The apartment itself was incredibly homely and inviting. We felt very comfortable and well looked after. The room was impeccably clean and tidy. The heating was on for us and some cold cans of coke. It had all the little extras, a selection of chocolates, lots of fresh towels, dressing robes and slippers! We were spoiled!
Nikola was very accommodating in relation to our check in, we where getting into Dublin rather late but he met us and walked us to the apartment. He was very fast at replying to our texts, Himself and his girlfriend Maya are very friendly and were very helpful. 
Overall 10/10, the accommodation can make a huge difference to a trip and having such a comfortable place to come home to really made it a wonderful time."
4759699,451865877,5/12/2019,"Nikola is a very nice host. He was replying immediately to all my messages and helped me with my luggage. The apartment was very quiet even if its so close to the (usually noisy)Temple Bar so I had a good sleep in the night. The location is excellent - you can easily reach Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar, public transport, shops and restaurants."
4759699,455873482,5/20/2019,"Nikola and Maya were incredible hostesses! Provided us with yummy delights and drinks. The location to the Airbnb is in the very center of the city and in a very cute and private community. Although the room and bathroom provided us with the main necessities, it was not as pictured on the listing. The place has carpet and my boyfriend is allergic to it- it was a tight space overall. But great location and service."
4759699,458637942,5/26/2019,We didnt feel very comfortable here. It is cluttered and not too tidy. The bed was fine and shower was fine. You cant beat the location though and the apartment is very safe!
4759699,467513246,6/10/2019,"We had a amazing stay at Nikolas and Mayas home. We felt very welcome and the both were absolutly fantastic hosts. They helped us out with any issue and many tipps. The room was super cozy and very quiet, although the apartment is in the heart of Dublin! I can just recommend this airbnb. :) thanks for having us! "
4759699,471268872,6/17/2019,"Nikola's apartment was great to stay at. It was very centrally located but still very quiet even though it is on a busy street. The room had thoughtful touches such as bathrobes, slippers, chocolates and cookies. Maya showed us to the apartment and was very accomodating and helpful when we had questions about getting around in the city. She even helped us with our heavy bags."
4759699,478864197,6/30/2019,Nikola and Maya were so welcoming and we felt at home in our space. Super helpful and easy to communicate with.
4759699,483032787,7/7/2019,Lovely friendly couple who will help you with anything and be very accommodating.
4759699,492460076,7/21/2019,"We stayed two nights with Nikola and his girlfriend Maya and had a great time! They were very friendly, amiable hosts. We were greeted with a beer each 
The place is very clean. the sheets and the towels were fresh and clean. The room isn't very spacious, as it's said in the description, but it t two small for two tall northern German guys to fit in.
So thanks for a great time in Dublin "
4759699,529225254,9/14/2019,Nikola and Maya are amazing. They very helpfull and very nice.  - I had a little accident at the 2.nd day Nikola write quickly a good adress for a docter. Both answer always soon as possible. In the room they have small sweets and fruits presented and they both gave good tips. On the last night we all went out to dinner and they showed me some of Dublin. It was great. Nikola and Maya was more as only a good host. For my the best place in Dublin. Thank you both.
4759699,534118516,9/22/2019,"The room is cozy, the house is very clean. I did not have access to the kitchen but the host is very helpful and you can ask him if you need to use it. The apartment is very central, you can do everything by walking from there, and the neighbourhood is very safe. The most famous pub Temple bar is just 5 min walking and there are many places for breakfast just near the apartment (in the same side walk). Was very easy to communicate with the host."
4759699,537863077,9/29/2019,We stayed for the weekend at Nikolas and we were so pleased with its prime location. House was cozy and clean and the communication was superb. I do recommend that place for a weekend escape.
4759699,546118014,10/13/2019,Fantastic location right by the Ha'penny bridge and walking distance to so many attractions in Dublin City! Nikola was so accommodating and even let us check in earlier and drop our bags because of an early flight into Dublin! Great hosts and lovely place. Highly recommend!
4759699,551430748,10/20/2019,Perfect spot! Recommended !!!
4774066,422495744,3/11/2019,"The apartment is very clean and in a wonderful location. Check in and out were very easyîBernard is very kind, and responds quickly to messages. I would absolutely stay here again on my next trip to Dublin!"
4774066,424769222,3/17/2019,"We spent Saint Patrick¬¥s  weekend here. It was quite nice overall, good enough bed and plenty of good restaurants very close by. 

The place is not in the city center but it is also a lot better priced than most of the places downtown."
4774066,425849446,3/19/2019,"Although I never met Bernard, communication was easy and quick. The room itself was exactly as described and for St Patricks Day weekend was reasonably priced. The room was clean and had a very comfortable bed."
4774066,427821101,3/24/2019,"Bernards place was clean and warm. Bernard was kind and flexible with check in time also which was very useful ! The location of this apartment is what makes it, in the very center of Rathmines you can walk everywhere or hop on a bus! Perfect for a short stay in Dublin!"
4774066,435110936,4/9/2019,Great location for me close to all amenities
4774066,440947017,4/21/2019,Nice host and comfortable room
4774066,462636700,6/2/2019,"The flat is fully equipped and clean, everything was perfect and the only little note regards the bathroom a bit small and without windows, but considering that in Dublin is very difficult to have accommodation with a private bathroom, this solution was very good. If the whether is good the guests can also enjoy a beautiful garden with table, benches and barbecue. The position is good although not properly in the centre, but you can reach the centre in 20/30 minutes on foot, otherwise the bus stop is exactly in front of the building. Dont forget to switch on the warm water before use the bathroom ;-)!"
4774066,520945991,8/31/2019,"Awesome! It has all you need!  
My husband, my two little dogs and I, stayed here for almost a month. Great location, pubs, restaurants, mall, park, cinema. 
Bernard is a greaaaat host!  
You should stay here :)"
4774066,529978357,9/15/2019,"Great location, clean place and comfortable."
4774066,535893248,9/25/2019,"A good option for your stay in Dublin! Its located 10 min from the very center in bus, with a lot of restaurants near. Bernard is a great host. We had a problem at our arrival and we could contact him with immediate answers and solution. I recommend!"
4774066,538081776,9/29/2019,"Amazing!! Despite of being a small apartment, it was absolutelly clean. The bed was very confortable, the small kitchen was more than enough and both shower and toilets worked perfectly. Highly recommendable!!"
4774066,542415215,10/6/2019,"Everything was great, just like the description "
4789565,421834536,3/10/2019,The Rathmines is a great location and Bernard is a great host.
4789565,425468318,3/18/2019,"The apartment was perfect. Everything clean, it had everything we need. The location is one of the best things because you have some restaurants and places to buy food, and you have the bus stop in front of the house so it is easy and fast to get the bus and in almost 10 minutes you are in the center.
The bathroom is in the apartment, and the only thing that can disturb you is the small shower, but the rest is perfect.
You can turn on and off the temperature of the room and you have a kitchen, so what more can you expect?
It was a really pleasure staying there, and I strongly recommend to go there in St Patricks day, it was amazing.
Thank you very much again Bernard, it was a pleasure."
4789565,458616985,5/26/2019,"The place was ok. We had some issues getting the shower hot and the shower was incredibly small, even for me. My husband could barely fit in it.

The bed was incredibly small for us as well. Almost laying to top of each other to fit lol and the WiFi was very spotty.

The locations is nice tho."
4789565,471348890,6/17/2019,"Ottimo host, molto veloce nelle risposte. Posto bello ma non bellissimo... (Website hidden by Airbnb) bene se andate in alloggio solo per dormire. 30 minuti da l centro a piedi..."
4789565,474526177,6/23/2019,"What a location, it is easily walkable to city centre, or simple quick bus ride in, yet just far enough to have its own village feel. It got better and better the more we explored. Bernard gives good recommendations but there is much more to find. Loved it."
4789565,478680992,6/30/2019,The location was great and the room was quiet and just the right size.
4789565,484007456,7/8/2019,"Very nice place to stay, good central location and transport links. Bernard was extremely helpful throughout our stay."
4789565,526798781,9/9/2019,"Bernard's place was really easy to find and only a short bus ride from Dublin City centre. There was a bus stop right by the accommodation and the high street nearby had several nice pubs and cafes. The accommodation was comfortable, quiet and had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend this accommodation for any couples who wish to have a city break in Dublin, but do not want to pay the very high hotel prices."
4789565,530090199,9/15/2019,"We had an awesome stay at Bernards Airbnb. 
Even we had some difficulties getting there on time to check in, Bernard made it work for us to check in easily. The area is lovely with grocery stores, bakerys, bars etc right around the corner. The apartment was a very nice stay like we expected! Thank you!"
4799169,425519224,3/18/2019,Berna is very lovely and I hope everyone gets a chance to stay at her place!
4799169,428952565,3/26/2019,Berna is such a nice person. Very helpful. She will be ready to attend ones needs and flexible if anything could happens.
4799169,429246095,3/27/2019,Lovely place to stay and Berna is very helpful.  I had a lovely walk to Dun Laoghaire.  Bedroom and ensuite were sparkling clean.
4799169,429565729,3/28/2019,Very friendly host with great accomodation!
4799169,432222342,4/3/2019,Berna was a lovely host. Would recommend her beautiful place to anyone looking to stay.

4799169,436595221,4/13/2019,Bernas house is a great location for visiting/ attending the Blackrock Clinic just 10 mins away. Berna was very helpful and welcoming.
4799169,439098988,4/18/2019,"We loved our stay with Berna. The house is nicely furnished. The address is very convenient, because there is a bus stop just five minutes by walk. 
The room was very good and we had our own bathroom which was a definite plus. Kitchen can be used which was very helpful for us. Betna provides you with breakfast as wel and was always eager to answer to any questions. Thanks for the hospitality."
4799169,445397318,4/29/2019,"We both loved the trip & our stay. Would 100% stay here again. Berna even dropped us off at the bus stop to go to Dun Laoghaire after a very early flight & trip to Dublin, Berna is very knowledgeable & helpful about the local area. Would highly recommend to stay here, bus ride into the city centre & close to The Seaside."
4799169,448556368,5/5/2019,"We had a lovely stay at Bernas home! We came in after 24 hours of traveling, and she made us feel so comfortable and welcomed! She knew all the great sights to see in Dublin, but also around all of Ireland! I would recommend this lovely home to anyone!!"

4799169,451201093,5/11/2019,Great hospitality and Flexibility from Berna! Amazing location and solution.
4799169,451726504,5/12/2019,Berna went way above and beyond to ensure me and my wife was set before we traveled! She made sure our boarding passes were printed off to fly out the next evening. She ever escorted us to a laundry mat down the road so we could do cloths before continuing our two week trip! Above and beyond amenities as well!
4799169,456389674,5/21/2019,Highly recommended place for staying.Very cooperative and best host .Great hospitality from host. A home away from home experience.
4799169,468426888,6/12/2019,A lovely place to stay south of the bustle of downtown Dublin. Thank you Berna and feline friend Coco.
4799169,469252339,6/14/2019,"Berna was very pleasant, helpful and informative  which  made our stay very pleasant. Her place was very nice clean and tidy so we would probably stay there again if we returned to Ireland. Also a good location for catching the bus into Dublin."
4799169,474732973,6/23/2019,"Not sure where to start with this review, within 90 minutes of arrival the Host Berna was offering us a full refund and telling us there were 300 other Air B&B's within the area to choose from, the reasons for this are as follows,
Upon arrival and after a quick chat the host told us to make ourselves at home and to make a cup of tea whenever we wished, she even went to the trouble of showing us where everything was and she then left to go to the shops. After unpacking my partner and I decided we would have a cup of tea, while we were making tea Berna arrived back from the shops, we said we were making a cup of tea and asked if she would like one also, her answer was astonishing to say the least, 
ITS COURTESY TO ASK BEFORE MAKING TEA IN SOMEONE ELSES HOUSE AND IF SHE WANTED TEA IN HER HOUSE SHE WOULD MAKE IT HERSELF.
She had just told us 30 minutes earlier to help ourselves to tea if we wished , she then accused me of walking around as if I owned the house, funny as I had only been in the bedroom that she had showed us and the kitchen where we were making tea, again not sure what made her say this. 
Her attitude as a host left a lot to be desired, the manner in which she dictated to us the rules she wanted us to abide by after the tea discussion I think she thought she was talking to 2 children instead of 2 mature adults.
In relation to the house itself,
No towel racks in the bathroom.
No toilet roll holders.

Bedroom
Smallest Double Bed we have ever slept in.
Wardrobes in the room were full of the hosts items with very little room for guests to use.

Kitchen
The kitchen was to put it mildly dirty, counters, stove had not been cleaned and we went to use the microwave and when we opened it looked like it had never been cleaned. The inside had remnants of food stuck to it that had to have been there for months.

Our overall assessment of our weekend was that this property for what it advertised as is not value for money, and the Host does not in our opinion have the required skills to run a business of this nature, 
We both appreciate that this property belongs to the host, but if you are going to rent rooms out (and they are not cheap for what you get) then you have to respect the people who have decided to use the property for vacation and do the best you can to ensure they at least enjoy their stay.

Just to say we declined the full refund as it was late Friday afternoon at this point and we could not guarantee finding somewhere else, besides we were supposed to be on holidays and had other plans

Value for money and overall enjoyment rating: 2/10"
4799169,475951170,6/25/2019,"I had a very comfortable two night stay at Berna's place. It's in a quiet neighbourhood, just one bus trip outside of Dublin. Berna is a very welcoming host and kindly accommodated my needs. She very helpful in providing advice for my stay in Dublin and Ireland"

4799169,484640473,7/9/2019,"Berna is a wonderful host. She is very accommodating, helpful and welcoming. We were able to fully relax at her place after our long walks around Dublin. Her house is very conveniently located, with easy access to Dublin or the seashore. Thank you very much !"
4799169,495576589,7/26/2019,Bernas place is bright and airy in a quiet location close to a bus route to the city. The decor is tasteful with a lovely secluded urban garden.

4799169,515077264,8/22/2019,"The house is nice. Berna was great helping with locations etc but the bedroom was abit fusty, the bed clothes didnt seam to be fresh. Abit disappointed with the breakfast. Bathroom shower needed abit of TLC too."

4799169,521862492,9/1/2019,"Berna was a supreme host. She was extremely flexible with our weird schedule and helpful with transportation advice as we settled our daughter into a local university. The house was lovely, with sun shining through multiple skylights (we were lucky and had several sunny days). As weary parents adjusting to empty nest-dom, my husband and I were grateful to be able to stay at Bernas house."

4857684,442828764,4/24/2019,"This is an amazing spot to stay, beach couldnt be any closer and a really great communal lawn with picnic benches meant we got to enjoy the sea views when we ate too. The kids loved the space and we did too. We will definitely be back again.

The apartment is very well set out and clean, the extra touches of having baby cot and high chair provided and set up ready for us and providing extra beach towels made us feel really looked after by our hosts. The accommodation had really comfy beds and fluffy towels too. 

Id definitely recommend this place and Mary and Jason were great hosts with prompt responses and clear information."

4857684,507958861,8/12/2019,"This is a beautiful place to stay,  right on the beach, the sun on the water in the morning, walking down the beach to the Harbour Bar in the evening. A good starting point for touring round and sight seeing and really good hosts, helpful, informative and friendly. Left us with lovely memories. Highly recommended.
Elizabeth, Mike, Brenda and Roger. August 2019."
4857684,514457998,8/21/2019,Lovely place and area everything great
4857684,521758024,9/1/2019,Mary and Jasons seaside apartment is clean and modern. Mary was very welcoming to us and a great host. We loved the fact that we could literally walk right out the door onto the beach. Beautiful location in Rush.
4857684,536289857,9/26/2019,The view is amazing. Waking up to the sound of the ocean waves is a dealbreaker for me! Mary and Jason are so kind and professional. I wouldnt have changed a thing about my stay. The apartment was perfect and the drive into the city was not far at all!
4857684,543169433,10/7/2019,"The flat was right on the beach with amazing views of the Irish Sea, and an easy walk to a cute pub with delicious food. Easy public transport into Dublin (around 45 minutes all up). The flat had everything you would need including coffee and oil for cooking etc. Modern kitchen and bathroom. Our favourite part was sitting on the picnic tables go watch sunrise over the beach at breakfast time! Would definitely recommend."
4857684,554985206,10/27/2019,"Great place to stay, spotlessly clean with sound of sea in background.
Stayed Friday to Sunday, apartment was ready for our arrival ahead of 15:00.
Hosts Mary and Jason were helpful from Start to Finish and responded instantly to messages. They are also generous, nothing was too much trouble, even extending our check out by several hours as we had a late flight. They epitomise everything a super host should be.
The apartment is good size, equipped with modern and quality appliances and very warm and cozy. 
The beds are comfortable and the quilts warm. Add to this the quiet location and the blackout and it is a restful place that makes sleeping easy and getting up a real struggle!
Bathroom is large and good selection of TV channels. WiFi easy to connect to and good for a number of devices.
Train from station is approx 1/2 hour and runs approx every half hour until 20:00 and low cost - around 7 Euros.
A tip for above you can use Visitor Leap card which is 10 Euros for 1 day our an incredible 19.20 Euros for 72 hours. This also allows you to use Luas, Dart, Buses in Dublin City and County. You cannot get the card on line, so try to get at Tourist Offices or allow time to post ahead of trip.
Overall a fabulous place to stay, spacious, warm and well equipped with great hosts who pride themselves on assisting their guests and providing a spotlessly clean environment. Rush is a good sized village with plenty of bars and restaurants, supermarkets and take seats.
I stayed with my wife and parents who are in their 70s. To a person we said we wouldnt hesitate to go back - you cannot recommend a place more than that"
4857684,558027257,11/2/2019,"My family of 5 has stayed at this beautiful apartment several times now and as usual, everything was great. Mary is a wonderful host who is very friendly and quick to communicate. The apartment is very clean and has everything we need. It is close to a grocery store and a few restaurants/cafes. There is a nearby train station that goes to Dublin (and other places) and the airport is fairly close as well. The view of the Irish sea is absolutely stunning and blows me away every time. We love to take walks on the beach. Thanks, as always, Mary for making our stay the best it can be!"
4872877,445876588,4/30/2019,I stayed at Jan's place for 4 months for an internship I had in Dublin. The place is as advertised and suited my needs.  It was fun to chatting with him the other housemates!
4872877,450027380,5/8/2019,Loved staying here. Nice people
4872877,474600761,6/23/2019,Nice
4872877,545938695,10/13/2019,"I stayed in this room for a month once I moved to Ireland and while looking for a place to rent in Dublin.  I highly recommend Jan's property, it was exactly what I needed to get settled and I wouldn't change anything about my decision to stay there. The bedroom is rather small but I found it to be comfortable for one person. You also have full access to the bathroom and kitchen, including all amenities. At the time of my stay there were 4 other people living in the house, but sharing space was never a problem, as everyone works and has their own schedule. Jan and Justyna are clean, courteous, and easy to talk to should an issue arise. While the property is fairly distant from city center, it is easily serviced by bus lines, close to a Dublin bikes station, and a cab costs less than 15 Euros. It is certainly worth the value compared to other properties that might be closer to city center, and also helped me become familiar with Dublin's public transport. I also enjoyed being close to Memorial Gardens and Dublin Food Co-op across from Kilmainham Jail. Finally, I had to cut my reservation short after starting a lease in Dublin, and Jan was especially considerate in arranging a refund. If you're looking for a long-term stay in Dublin, you simply can't go wrong with reserving this room!"
4928554,521937701,9/1/2019,"Superb location, close to the centre, right besides the canal, dublin bikes within a few steps.  Brenda is an excellent host, she made me feel very welcome. The place is really cozy and warm, with a small patio and the room upstairs is just superb."
4940924,425519004,3/18/2019,"I stayed with Brian and his lovely family during the St Patty's long weekend, and they were amazing. I can't even begin to describe the level of hospitality from everyone. Brian and his son Patty greeted me late in the evening, and dropped me off to the light rail so I could get into town (which was only a 20min ride in). The room is large and spacious, with a very comfortable bed. Kitchen well equipped, with views to the beautiful backyard where you could a glimpse of the two peacocks. I would highly recommend Brian's to anyone travelling through Dublin."
4940924,537162881,9/28/2019,"The family were really lovely, outstanding hospitality. Highly recommended."
4940924,551391666,10/20/2019,"Brian house is in a lively location in Dublin. We had courses at the weekend and this was just a short hop from Killiney and Stillorgan. The room is a great space and everything was spotless. Netflix on the TV, super comfy bed and Brian had tea and coffee prepared for breakfast the following morning too. We couldnt stay for breakfast but it was a  nice touch. Well worth staying here"
4940924,566964609,11/21/2019,Really comfortable stay in a beautiful family home. Hosts were very welcoming.

4963289,425891594,3/19/2019,"Albert is an amazing host! His house is right by the coast, which provides a beautiful walk into town to catch the dart. There is a bus stop right outside of his home in the main road (about a 2 min walk).  Albert was full of information and details to get us where we needed to be. We would definitely stay with him again!"
4963289,427868501,3/24/2019,Absolutely perfect... great communication from Albert and everything needed was provided. Delicious breakfast and all facilities were perfect too. Would reccomend 100%
4963289,431617435,4/1/2019,"Alberts home was nothing but perfect. It by far exceeded my expectations and if I could give more than 5 stars I would. We had access to the entire upstairs of his home without interruption and breakfast was on the table waiting for us every morning. I have already referred his home to multiple friends and family and if i am to use AirBnB in Dublin again, I would hope it would be at his home.

Thank you Albert for a wonderful experience."
4963289,432928596,4/5/2019,Albert is an outstanding host! He is very friendly and his accommodations were comfortable and thoughtful.

4963289,443635369,4/26/2019,"Albert was a wonderful host! He truly went above and beyond all expectations. On a rainy day, he picked us up at the train station so we wouldnt have to walk in the rain. He provided wonderful advice for outings and best ways to travel. The space was cozy and breakfast was delicious every day. I would definitely stay with them again (and I hope I get the opportunity to do so!)"
4963289,444119875,4/27/2019,We had a great stay  beautiful place!
4963289,444779356,4/28/2019,"Perfect arrangement with bedroom, private bath & a private sitting room where you can relax & eat breakfast at your leisure."
4963289,446824569,5/2/2019,"No hot water for (nice big) bathtub or shaving was annoying & disappointing. Never before in 40 years of travel have we been without hot water. The host did say he would turn on the water heater in the morning (for shaving), but there was no hot water when I shaved at 7am. Otherwise, everything else was OK. Host (Albert) was pleasant, the location is about 20 minute walk from 'downtown' Malahide."
4963289,448582032,5/5/2019,"What a very good experience. Albert cares lovingly for everything. The situation could not be better. 200m from the beach in a quiet residential area. A train station to Dublin in about 20 minutes on foot, bus to the airport, and a parking lot on the street in front of the house. Lovable little town. You have the top floor for yourself, the private bathroom is very pleasant, the breakfast is ready every morning in the small ""princesses"" room with fridge and kettle. We will be back definitely."
4963289,452960631,5/14/2019,"Great location, walking distance to Malahide town center and right near the beach! The private upstairs area was great for having coffee in the morning. The space was very clean and welcoming, would definitely stay again!"

4963289,457989055,5/25/2019,"Great hospitality. Response time excellent. Albert allowed us to check in very early in the morning which was greatly appreciated. Great advice to leave our rental vehicle at his home and take the train to Dublin City center. Cost for 2 return Euro 12.50. Worked beautifully.
Location is a comfortable 10-15min walk to the village along the sea front. We would highly recommend this B&B - great location proximity to the airport and Dublin City Center ."
4963289,460439724,5/29/2019,"Lovely home with private space for guests to relax and great amenities. Albert made us feel very welcome, and was quick to respond to any communication .

Malahide is a lovely village to explore and Albert's house is great short walking distance to village and also so very close to beach and walkways. Would highly recommend."
4963289,460900257,5/30/2019,"It was absolutely wonderful staying at Albert's place. Lovely home, which is a 10-15 min walk from the town centre. Parking available and it is a short drive to the airport.

4963289,463873817,6/4/2019,"Albert's place is a cute, well organized get-away in beautiful Malahide. It's also just 15 minutes from the airport which is why we chose it for our last night in Ireland. We arrived relatively late because our plan for the day had not worked out the way we had planned, but Albert was super helpful and quickly showed us everything we needed to know."
4963289,464293542,6/5/2019,"Albert's place in incredible. Our plans got changed, so we were unable to spend an entire day in Malahide as planned. However, Albert made our incredibly short overnight stay a true dream. The room was comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was spacious and sparking clean. Albert went above and beyond as a host and personally retrieved us from the train station at 10pm and has a light breakfast (tea, coffee, cereal, scones, fruit, granola bar) available. You must, MUST stay with Albert when you visit Malahide. We know for certain that we want to come back soon."

A special mention to the brack offered on our arrival.  To the baker - Yummy"
4963289,468009411,6/11/2019,"Albert was a great host and answered all our questions and was willing to give us local information as well.

4963289,475429607,6/24/2019,"A magic place with an amazing host. The house is about 10-20 minutes from the village center. It's very accessible and the walk is very nice, you're walking next to the beach it is really peaceful. Malahide village is so relaxing too, people are very nice and caring. Moreover Malahide castle and gardens are a ""must see"", It has such an incredible halo and ambiance it won't let you neutral.
And if you miss the city you can simply take a train from Malahide to Dublin and visit it.
If you want to go to a concert or festival in Ireland, Malahide is the place to go and the place to stay.

Personally I'm hoping to get back as soon as possible.
You can't get enough of magic, can you ?

- Camille."
4963289,476403177,6/26/2019,"Albert is indeed a superhost!  He made our first day in Ireland so wonderful with his exceptional hospitality, charming home, delicious snacks, and helpful suggestions for enjoying magical Malahide.

Bed was comfy, water pressure in the shower was great and plenty of hot water.  There was also a separate room set up as a TV room and breakfast room.

4963289,480175898,7/2/2019,"I had an excellent stay here over two nights. As a weary traveler being on the road for three months this was the ideal situation to rest in a peaceful environment. Everything was as pictured, clean, cozy and private, with extra nice touches of breakfast foods (including nice homemade scones). The bed was very comfortable and the room very quiet. Good shower with hot water. I had the best two nights sleep Ive had in months. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood with birdsong and beautiful views of trees from both the bedroom and sitting rooms. I enjoyed a leisurely 15 minute walk along the coastal path to Malahide village where I had a nice healthy lunch at D/F cafe and was able to visit a post office and SuperValu market. A few minutes walking past the village is Malahide castle with an Avoca Shop where you can have a lovely meal and do some shopping. A 3 minute walk away from the house is the bus stop with a 3 Euro direct line to Dublin Airport. Albert was communicative, gracious and friendly. I would have loved to stay longer and would definitely return."
4963289,482413892,7/6/2019,"We could not have asked for a nicer stay in Malahide! Its such a lovely coastal village with lots of shops and restaurants, and Alberts place is the perfect home baseù for coming and going. Private and quiet, overlooking a pretty park and steps to the beach, easy train ride into Dublin... we felt so comfortable there and had an absolutely delightful stay. Albert was so hospitable and helpful with recommendations, and we especially appreciated the lovely breakfast he set every morning in the little sitting lounge next to our room. We enjoyed our time in Malahide and at Alberts place so much... we highly recommend both and hope to return someday!"

4963289,520245292,8/30/2019,"We stayed in Albert's place the night before we flew out of Dublin's airport.  We drove our hire car to the airport in the early morning very quickly, so his place was very convenient for our needs.  We didn't get to see much of Malahide but what we did see looked very nice. Albert's accommodation was great with bedroom , sitting/breakfast room and bathroom all on your own private floor.  Albert himself was very friendly and helpful
 You could walk to the beach very easily from his house. We would recommend Albert's place for sure"
4963289,520992303,8/31/2019,We had a wonderful stay at Alberts house and can highly recommend his property.

4963289,531311808,9/17/2019,Albert's place was quaint and welcoming. There were freshly made scones and tea awaiting us in the tea room. It is right near the water where we took some great pictures. He is accommodating

4963289,550793624,10/19/2019,"Wonderful accommodation on the outskirts of Dublin, close to the lovely town and airport.  Everything in the accommodation was lovely, well presented, extremely clean and with lots of space and privacy.  Highly recommended."

Near shop and station
Everything we nead Tony help us"
4970134,432281852,4/3/2019,"Great location and clean space. Communication could improve. Had to call to confirm booking and how to check-in. Otherwise, good experience."
4970134,435393650,4/10/2019,"Great location and perfect to get around the sights and on top of the Temple Bar area.  We were a party of four and the space was more than adequate. 

Enjoyable stay and Dumitras was kind enough to let us park our car in the free parking space after we had checked out."
4970134,449334397,5/6/2019,great location but took forever to get a hold of host day of check in.
4970134,452442085,5/13/2019,"Great location. Good size of apartment and clean. Good fast communication with host. Made things very easy. Happy with stay, thank you."
4970134,464357208,6/5/2019,"The apartment is in a very good location. Near to Temple Bar and Trinity College yet in a quiet side street which feels quite safe. Just a short stroll to many restaurants. Having a secure parking lot within the building is big plus for those who are driving.  The apartment itself is clean and functional. The beds in the room are very comfortable but the sofa bed had a bit of nicotine smell. Everything in the kitchen works so we were able to do our laundry and make our own breakfast. 
We had a bit of issue at check-in when we couldn't open the lock box holding the apartment keys but Dumitras was great and came down immediately to help us retrieve the keys. The hot water worked fine throughout our 2-day stay until the morning of our check-out when for some reason, there was no hot water for the shower. As we were checking out that morning, we did not want to bother Dumitras again but I am sure he would have fixed it speedily if we had requested. Overall, a good value and comfortable stay in the city centre."
4970134,480662745,7/3/2019,"This apartment is in a great location for staying in Dublin. A few minutes walk to Temple Bar, and just over the bridge to the shopping area."
5024037,426495666,3/21/2019,"Very nice home with all the amenities you could need.  Sean and Jason put together a great guidebook for their home and the local community. There are great tips on places to eat, grocery stores,  and transportation.  They made our stay so easy!"
5024037,463470269,6/3/2019,"Lovely space, exactly as described. The underfloor heating makes it very cosy and comfortable and Sean and Jason were very helpful and timely in their correspondence with us. Would definitely recommend."
5024037,556795705,10/30/2019,"Sean's place is great. Loved the heated floors throughout, kitchen was really well equipped, bed comfy and everything was spotless. Sean gave great instructions for the bus which was super easy and quick to get everywhere. There are a few excellent restaurants within walking distance. We would definitely recommend The Pigeon House. Overall it was a fab trip and we'd love to do it all over again!"
5045518,425490704,3/18/2019,Clean well supplied place. Close walking distance to bus stop to go downtown.
5045518,427326681,3/23/2019,"Very nice place for a family, too. You got a whole house in a quit location."
5045518,433956125,4/7/2019,Relaxing stylish space with all the comforts of home. Location is great base for trips to the City Center or to points North of the City -  Onsite parking  near light rail (10-15m - DART Killester Station) and near bus lines direct to the City Center.
5045518,437028618,4/14/2019,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Dublin. We came here for business, came as a family of four with a baby. All went extremely well. The accommodation was wonderful! It was exactly where we needed to be. The place was stylish, clean and very comfortable! Pauline was very nice indeed. We will be coming back for sure!!!!"
5045518,463935129,6/4/2019,"I truly enjoyed my stay here. Pauline went above and beyond to make my stay as painless and comfortable as possible. Thank you for sharing your home with me, Pauline!"
5045518,467865612,6/11/2019,"Our short stay at Pauline's was too short!  So comfortable and home-y, clean and attractive!!
We particularly enjoyed living in this residential area with normal daily life going on all around us and would definitely stay here again, as it is also very handy to downtown Dublin.  Thanks, Pauline, for this lovely home!"
5045518,470558673,6/16/2019,"Pauline was a great host. She answered any queries I had regarding location or public transport right away. Very detailed and helpful check in details provided. Check in was also flexible which suited my needs. Great amenities provided, we didnt need anything extra...there was even a wee pint of milk in the fridge. The house was very clean and cosy. Public transport is only a few minutes walk away and the location is perfect for exploring Dublin City and the surrounding area."
5045518,488656901,7/15/2019,"This place was wonderful landing spot for this jet-lagged traveler and her elderly mom. Pauline couldnt have been nicer or more accommodating. We loved the bus access and the experience of being in a real neighborhood - not a tourist area. Thanks so much for all, Pauline!"
5045518,494457386,7/24/2019,"Great place to stay - so quiet at night, private parking on site, and very handy for access into town (by bus). The house is bright, spotless, exceptionally well set up for self-catering, and there's a really generous attention to detail in the home comforts available to the visitor."
5045518,507259069,8/11/2019,"Pauline's house was comfortable and quiet. It is in a good location very close to a bus stop, and not too far from a DART stop either.

Pauline was a great host with quick responses to any questions. She was also very generous in letting us check in early as she didn't have anyone staying the night before. 

The check in process was very easy.

Thanks!"
5045518,513314475,8/19/2019,"This was our second visit to stay in Paulines place and again we had a great time, also we were able to enjoy the garden this time around."
5045518,519368227,8/28/2019,"We (family of three) stayed seven nights at Paulines place and really enjoyed it.  At first I thought you would really need a car (which we did not have) but we managed fine.  There is a small market a few blocks away and a Tesco Superstore less than a mile away.  The bus for the city center is on the other side of the park so about a three minute walk.  The train to Howth and to Malahide (both we went to for afternoon visits and highly recommend) is about a twenty minute walk.  The house is comfortable with plenty of natural light, the kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans and the beds were comfortable.  If we return to Dublin we would stay there again."
5045518,525967316,9/8/2019,"This is a handy apartment location.  Getting into town is simple on the bus, and costs 3¬£ apiece to downtown or the Temple Bar area (8 minute bus ride).  Very kind host."
5045518,530875923,9/16/2019,Paulines place was exactly what we needed after our tour around Ireland before we flew home. Thanks for the hospitality!
5045518,536315869,9/26/2019,Perfect!
5045518,558728305,11/3/2019,Very comfortable accommodation 12 minutes away from the city centre
5056234,425927784,3/19/2019,"There were 7 of us for a short stay in Dublin. We appreciated our accommodation, everything was fine. The apartment is well located and is approximately 10-15 mn journey by bus from the downtown (Bus 11, approx 5mn walk).
Ronan is very reactive and can answer to your questions fast.
The neighberhood is quite."
5056234,450069095,5/8/2019,"Excellent place to stay.  Lovely and spacious, and there were 5 of us (two of which are a couple) so each of us having our own bathroom was a definite plus. Its a really lovely quiet spot, close to UCD and the 11 bus which takes you straight into town. Highly recommend."
5056234,471273766,6/17/2019,Nice large space with four bedrooms and four baths.  Good for a large family.
5056234,480243365,7/2/2019,"Ronan's house has everything in order to have a nice and pleasant stay in Dublin. Fully equipped with modern furniture, in a super safe neighborhood 20 minutes to the city centre by bus and with a host that takes care about your stay and quickly offers his help for everything you need. I fully recommend it!"
5056234,484181587,7/8/2019,"Beautiful place in a lovely location, not too far from the city, a short 10 minute drive depending on traffic. Perfect place at a reasonable price for a large party. Ronan was quick to respond to any questions and happy to help with any problems, an all around great place."
5056234,498102260,7/29/2019,"We had a nice week in Dublin staying at Ronan' house. The house is spacious and has a good bus connection to the city centre. Also, the communication with Ronan was very good. Thanks!"
5056234,511532965,8/17/2019,"Ronan was great, the place was beautiful and I would highly recommend it"
5056234,516342491,8/24/2019,"Seven of us used this as our base of operations for a week exploring Dublin and the surrounding area (for four of us, this followed a week of cycling the west coast), and I really couldnt be more pleased with decision to stay here. With plenty of space, in a quiet neighborhood, within minutes of public transportation (20-30 minutes by bus to city center, depending on the time of day), and a short walk from a small market and a few pubs/restaurants (Id recommend Ashtons - or a quick bus/cab ride into Ranelagh, which has quite a bit more to offer), I found the location to be terrific. More than that, it has that feeling of home that lets you relax after a day touring the city, or like we did, Howth, Dalkey, and Bray. While Ronan was unable to meet us in person, he was a very good, responsive host, who provided us with what truly felt like a home-away-from-home. My eight-year-old son would recommend this for the Super Nintendo alone, and while I too am a fan of Mario Kart, Id add that this is a very comfortable and welcoming space to call home while you explore the best that Dublin has to offer."
5056234,524188728,9/5/2019,"This is a great accommodation for large groups. We had a very nice stay. Be aware that the house isn't in the city center, though it is very easy to get there by bus.
It's great that every bedroom has it's own bathroom.
Unfortunately there aren't many big pans in the kitchen, but we still managed to cook for all of us.
It took us a while to figure out how the heating and the wifi works.
In the end everything worked out fine though. If you're traveling with a bunch of people and you're looking for a place where evryone has their own space and nice common areas this is the place to go."
5056234,528112698,9/12/2019,Excellent service from Ronan the host and a lovely place to stay.  We are very pleased.
5056234,533156527,9/21/2019,Enjoyed our stay. The house was very spacious and pleasant. I would definitely recommend it to others.
5056234,542379797,10/6/2019,We searched high and low for a location that would accommodate 8 and this 4 bd/4 bath spot really hit the mark.  It is a quiet place yet easily within range of the city center to be ideal for us.  We could not be happier with our choice to stay here.
5056234,551325399,10/20/2019,"We stayed at Ronan's house while we visited our daughter at UCD (studying abroad this semester). The location is fantastic for visiting the school. The house is very spacious and visually interesting.  I enjoyed cooking dinner for a dozen of my daughter's friends in the kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. We did not rent a car, but the house is within walking distance to a bus and the train. Cab's are easily requested by an app to get to the grocery store."
5056234,556689958,10/30/2019,A great stay! This townhome provided very spacious very clean accommodations for our entire family while we visited our daughter at UCD as well as visiting Dublin and taking tours across Ireland. The number 11 bus takes you straight from city center to the end of Wynnsward Park. I highly recommend  this townhome and Ronan as a host! He was very attentive and responsive.
5056234,560302496,11/6/2019,"This place was perfect for a group of people.  Each bedroom had its own ensuite and the beds were very very comfortable.  The kitchen was well stocked and laundry was available.  The sitting room was spacious and was great for congregating.  We cooked meals and ate at the local pubs (Farmer Brown's pub around the corner had the best fish and chips in Dublin...and we tried quite a few!).  The bus stop for the 11 bus into the city was right at the end of the street.  Everything was wonderful and Ronan was quick to respond and easy to deal with.  If in Ireland again, we would definitely stay here!"
5075191,428502160,3/25/2019,Great location!
5075191,430882016,3/31/2019,Fabulous apartment and host. Apartment was in a perfect location close to everything. Sally was lovely from the start. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.

5075191,440726590,4/21/2019,"Location could not be any better! Sally was an excellent host and the apartment was stunning. 
Thank you, Sally!"
5075191,444823744,4/28/2019,"What a fab place much bigger 
than it looks
Fab location in the middle of town with everything within walking distance
Tina & Friends"
5075191,461378491,5/31/2019,"Could not possibly be a better location, central to everything.  You walk out onto Grafton Street where it meets Trinity College and you are immediately swept into the excitement of Dublin.  The living room is huge, with high ceilings and large windows overlooking Grafton Street.  Our host Sally treated us like family and helped us whenever we asked... including finding transportation to Cork that accommodated our special needs.
If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of city living, then this is the place for you.  Be warned that with that comes noises from Grafton street at all hours of the day and night.  The main bedroom is in the back of the building where you cannot hear the street noise, but you will from the living room.  Another caveat is you have to make it up approximately 15 stairs to access the unit.  No problem at all unless you have mobility issues.   As noted in other reviews, the 2nd bedroom is small.
We could not have been happier and would recommend this place to anyone who loves to be right in the middle of a vibrant city.  Thank you Sally."
5075191,464367985,6/5/2019,Wonderful location. Great size. Sally is a very responsive and caring host.

5075191,478705196,6/30/2019,Wonderful owner and a very convenient location. I can recommend Sally without reservation. :-)
5075191,480234821,7/2/2019,Very centrally located and easily accommodated family of 4. Unfortunately the apartment is part of an older building (not surprising given location) and had no sound insulation to the apartment above which had active residents until the early hours of the morning.
5075191,482397502,7/6/2019,The apartment is beautiful and centrally located. We throughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to stay again. Sally was very attentive and quickly responded to any questions. If you are a light sleeper then the noise at night might be noticeable but the location far outweighed any concerns. The back bedrooms are quieter. We truly loved our stay!
5075191,484214695,7/8/2019,"Great, spacious place in heart of Dublin. Extremely comfortable. Sally was very responsive and helpful. Only complaint about the apartment is the noise from neighbors upstairs."

5075191,492254190,7/21/2019,"We all had a great time. We were a group of 4 friends, we had loads of space. Would definitely recommend. The apartment is perfect for adults. It's really clean, showers are lovely, and  the location was just perfect. Sally was very friendly to deal with and replied quickly to any querie."
5075191,494990547,7/25/2019,"Sally is a perfect host, she gives all necessary informations and is very quick to answer and helpful. The apartment location is perfect and the living room is big."
5075191,496362011,7/27/2019,"Cannot beat the location. Across from Trinity College and next to an amazing chocolate shop and the Irish Whiskey Museum, there is no need to go far to get what you need. Highly recommend to everyone and the host Sally is lovely and is quick to respond."

5075191,522469178,9/2/2019,Would highly recommend this flat for anyone who wants to be in the centre of Dublin. Sally was a wonderful host - our ferry from Wales to Dublin was cancelled and Sally was able to make alternate arrangements so we could still gain access to the flat at 1am when we had to take a later ferry!  She is a rock star.  Fabulous restaurant and grocery recommendations - thanks for making our first stay in Dublin so memorable.
5075191,525130277,9/7/2019,Beautiful apartment right in the middle of the action of all that Dublin has to offer. The entire apartment is large and spacious with everything you need! Highly recommend!
5075191,531811678,9/18/2019,"Terrific apartment on Grafton Street across from the entrance to Trinity College. Very well located, in the middle of everything. And yet the bedrooms were very quiet. The apartment is just as described. Sally is kind and thoughtful, and responded almost immediately to all inquiries.  Plus she gave us an above-the-call-of-duty explanation of the Dublin theater scene. (She is a theater person herself.)  Highly recommended in all respects."
5075191,532790397,9/20/2019,"The location on Grafton St. was ideal for walking everywhere in the city. The apartment was very spacious , clean, modern and well equipped.  The layout provided privacy to couples sharing

We very much enjoyed our stay !"

5082334,438753834,4/17/2019,"Catherine's place is just as described.  I found it comfortable, cozy and so convenient to walk downtown, while being just far away enough to maintain a little quiet at night.  Catherine is a great host and I would recommend her space to anyone!"
5082334,440077082,4/20/2019,Catherines place was a cosy little gem super close to everything. Easy access and walking distance to the city with a clean and comfortable room. Cathrine is very friendly and welcoming! We would definitely stay again :)

5082334,448505713,5/5/2019,"Catherine's place is in a good location, close to Dublin's main attractions. Catherine is a nice host and she was very responsive to our questions. The bathroom is quite small and the room is rather small to accommodate two people. No key for the room, neither for the bathroom is available. Cleaning could be better. Quite expensive comapred to other rooms in the same area of Dublin."
5082334,454473490,5/18/2019,"Catherine was great! The place was very comfy, excellent bed!"
5082334,457987994,5/25/2019,"Catherine's space was great. Location was just far enough to be away from the loud hustle and bustle, but only 3 blocks or so from St Patrick's Cathedral. She was very accommodating about letting me drop off my bag before check in.  She also had a great list of both local places to eat/drink and places to try in the more touristy center. I felt safe in the neighborhood and the house as a solo traveler. I would definitely stay here again if back in Dublin."
5082334,459250074,5/27/2019,"Friendly and helpful hostess. Good location. Room was smaller than expected. Had to hand fill the tank of the toilet since it was broken, which was gross and time consuming. She said that she is trying to fix this issue and had a plumber out earlier on the day we checked in, but he was unable to resolve the issue. Hopefully it will be fixed soon."
5082334,469886317,6/15/2019,"We enjoyed staying at Catherine's home. The area is charming and the room is really quiet, so you can get a good night's sleep although you are in the centre of a city. Catherine is an easy-going host whom we loved talking to and who gave us useful tips. She is extremely helpful if you need something. We also appreciated using her kitchen for a quick lunch and for our breakfasts. Everything we wanted was there!"
5082334,474633676,6/23/2019,"Catherine is a really warm, generous host. I recommend her whole-heartedly!"
5082334,480630199,7/3/2019,"Catherine is a gem! Her place is perfectly located in walking distance to all things Dublin. She was so warm and welcoming, I felt like we were kindred spirits. Had a wonderful visiting."
5082334,494298459,7/24/2019,The host canceled this reservation 85 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5082334,508110295,8/12/2019,"Catherines place was great- good location that was walking distance to everything but on a quiet street 
Cozy room and Catherine was a very communicative great host"
5082334,513298610,8/19/2019,"Despite we didnt get the chance to know each other ( basically because we were outside all day ), we had a wonderful experience at Catherines place. Everything was tidy and clean.
Great location in a lovely neighborhood.

5082334,524232321,9/5/2019,"Catherine is absolutely wonderful and so quick to be helpful in anything you need. The location is perfect. Its walking distance to just about anywhere, but if you happen to need the Leap Card, Catherine has one you can borrow. The house is on a cute and quaint street so you wont be bothered by any noise. Overall, an amazing time spent here!"
5082334,531415641,9/17/2019,"We stayed at Catherine's appartment for 3 nights, which was enough to explore the most important places in Dublin. The appartment was very clean and tidy, as well as located close to Dublin's sights. It was perfectly easy to reach everything by walking. Catherine as a host was very accommodating. When we cleaned our dishes ourselves, she told us that there is no need for that since we are on holiday and that she will do it later. All in all, our stay at Catherine's was very nice."
5082334,543279436,10/7/2019,"Great experience, Catherine was very responsive and flexible to our request to check in a bit early. She gave us a list of good restaurants in the area and thats basically all we ate."
5082334,545391031,10/12/2019,"Catherine's place is a nice little house in Dublin city centre, close to everything (walking distance).
Catherine is a very good and extremely considerate host, having in mind that I had a late flight and I came in after midnight. All the instructions were clear and understandable.
It was all impeccable during my stay.
Thanks Catherine"
5084809,420278404,3/6/2019,"would highly reccomend , great hosts and good location."
5084809,421976570,3/10/2019,"Nice and clean house in a quiet neighbourhood
Very friendly couple willing to have a chat and share tips
Simple but nice breakfast with tea/coffee, toast and fruit 
 Easy transport to Dublin center by bus at the bus stop within a few minutes by foot, you will need 3 euro's in coins per person for a one way ticket"
5084809,425423171,3/18/2019,A comfortable place to stay with good bus links into the centre of Dublin.
5084809,431572505,4/1/2019,Very hospitable! We were grateful for a pleasant experience.
5084809,435398632,4/10/2019,"The place was nice. The location is not very near to the center and all the sights, but I guess that is explained in the description. I think it is a bit pricey for that location. 
There was a shampoo, but noo shower gel provided. 
Breakfast was included, but very simplified- bread, butter, jam and cereal.  The room was warm but not the kitchen. 
On the good side - hosts are very friendly, house was very clean. Bus stops were very close. The neighborhood was nice."
5084809,438663703,4/17/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Federico's place. Federico was very friendly and easygoing. He welcomed us with some nice tea. The room and the facilities were just as the photos show, and we appreciated the daily breakfast. I recommend you to stay with Federico in Dublin. :)"
5084809,440146652,4/20/2019,"Federicos place was comfortable and he was very friendly. The breakfast he serves is good, and helps you save money on your trip. The location is a little far from the city center, but the transportation isnt too expensive. Highly recommend this private room."

5084809,491631242,7/20/2019,"Federicos house is nice and located in quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Dublin. If youre looking for a cosy room out of the way then this is the perfect spot for you. However, its a bit inconvenient (and expensive) to get to the city center without a car. Overall we had a lovely stay with Federico!"
5084809,494522722,7/24/2019,Stayed at Frederico's place for one night. I arrived pretty late during the night but was there to welcome me. His place is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a great touch. Definitely recommend!

5084809,511501640,8/17/2019,"Federico is a very good host. The place is very clean and quiet. At the South of Dublin, many bus stops are located close to the apartment so it is easy to go in town.
Federico and Jody are respectful and kind persons. Many thanks, especially for the lovely breakfast, prepared each morning.
Do not hesitate with them it is a safe and good address."
5084809,521877915,9/1/2019,"Convenient located in a quiet neighbourhood just outside downtown,easily accessible by bus 150 or 9 from the city. Tidy and neatly decorated room. Tesco, SPAR as well as a bar located just around the corner and the hosts, Federico and his wife Jodie, is a lovely and helpful couple!"
5084809,524714651,9/6/2019,Very nice room in a quiet area with many buses to the city centre!

5092240,434094944,4/7/2019,"Had a great stay! The apartment was very clean and within a 5 minute walk to the Laus stop which made it convenient to get into the city centre. Overall, a very good experience."
5092240,455845515,5/20/2019,"The apartment is stylish, comfy and clean and there is pretty much everything we were in need of, the position is also perfect as it allows for traveling through the city centre by foot alone. Anna has been really welcoming, giving us info about the must-to-visit places and giving us freedom to use the apartment as we saw fit. Heartily recommended!"
5092240,462692728,6/2/2019,Great stay!
5092240,473221031,6/21/2019,Everything was as advertised! A great stay in Dublin
5092240,480769379,7/3/2019,"Anna offered a warm welcome into her home. Tea and coffee was included which we gratefully used every morning! I would say the biggest drawback is that the place is about a brisk 20 minute walk from where it's all happening in Dublin. This was okay for me, but for my mom who isn't used to walking as much was a little bit of a problem."
5092240,519378428,8/28/2019,"We stayed at Annas place for 3 nights. The location is great - we walked all over Dublin without problems. We had access to the kitchen and fridge, so we bought groceries at a close by grocery store and cooked breakfast every morning. We also had access to the washing machine, and did 2 loads of laundry. Detergent was not provided so we purchased it at the grocery store, and there was no dryer, but Anna provided us with a large drying rack and a dehumidifier. Anna and her partner were pleasant hosts and offered us lots of great tips for eating and drinking in Dublin. One of the bars they suggested ended up being our favourite in all of Dublin. They have a cat, which was nice, but was very energetic at times.    We kept our bedroom door closed so the cat stayed in the main area. Overall, we loved Dublin and had a good experience."
5092240,526785992,9/9/2019,"Anna was an amazing host. She waited for us for the check in, cause our flight was delayed. She took her time to show us the house and tell us about the city. 
The apartment is welcoming, everything is in a walking distance. 
Thank you for hosting us! Definitely would recommend to anyone who plans to visit Dublin."
5092240,534804501,9/23/2019,Tutto ottimo posizione pulizia host comunicazione e sicuramente prezzo. Una sola nota quella di lasciare un po di spazio nei cassetti in modo da sistemare i vestiti.
5092240,542177836,10/6/2019,Cosy appartment with great kitchen and bathroom. Anna was very kind when she welcomed us and was very reactive to my messages before our arrival. I totally recommend !
5092240,559953335,11/5/2019,"It's a nice and cosy appartment. Everything is clean and you can use all facilities. We didn't meet the owner, but she answers very quickly by email. We had a very nice stay. It was close to all high lights we wanted to see. Nice area. The only thing we didn't know is that she had a cat. It was a sweet cat but my friend was allergic so she needed to be careful. Other than that I would recommend this place."
5092240,562841461,11/11/2019,"Nice place to stay in Dublin, around 15 minutes walk to city centre. Anna was a friendly and helpful host, there were cooking and laundry facilities in the flat."

5092800,506198436,8/10/2019,We had a lovely stay in Anna's flat which was walking distance to Heuston station as well as to all the tourist attractions downtown. Everything was as we expected:-)

No bad surprises, everything like expected."
5095083,423492910,3/14/2019,"Leos place is awesome and pretty much as central as you can get in Dublin!
The room is cosy and has a full ensuite which is mega convenient.
Due to me arriving late in the evening I only met Leo briefly but he seems like a genuinely nice guy and will look forward to staying at his place again next time Im in Dublin.
Awesome communication prior to stay too with extremely detailed description of how to access to property which was mega helpful. Thanks Leo!"
5095083,424194612,3/16/2019,"The apartment and room were great. Leo was very friendly and helpful with the self check in, giving detailed instructions. The bed was so comfy it felt like we were sleeping on a cloud! The room is well located with the private bathroom. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5095083,426485737,3/21/2019,"Leos place is tops! The location is unbeatable. Youre just so close to everything. We walked everywhere because it was all so accessible (and safe!). Leo gave perfect directions for not only getting to his place but getting into it. The room was immaculate. He has two adaptors in the room so if youve forgotten yours, dont worry! The en-suite bathroom is the perfect touch too. The space is so private and feels like your own apartment. I would 1000% recommend to anyone coming to Dublin who wants to be close to it all and have a perfectly private and easily accessible place to stay!"
5095083,430335205,3/30/2019,"We are so happy we chose to stay with Leo! The location is easy to get to from the airport and bus stops, plus is downtown which made all of the sites we wanted to see easy to get to by foot. There is a variety of take out restaurats near by, in addition to several grocery stores on the block so we were able to buy groceries to cook in the kitchen. The room is very private and when we happened to be at the apartment at the same time as Leo (he is a busy artist and was out most of the time) he was friendly and respectful."
5095083,431980857,4/2/2019,"Leo is a friendly and nice guy with awesome tips for Dublin! The room was clean and in the centre of the city. From there you can get easily to temple bar and to the city for shopping. Even the Bus for the airport is just 5 minutes away!
Thank you for the great time :)"
5095083,432983704,4/5/2019,"Perfect location near the bus and trainstation to go to the airport or Howth. 10 min to walk to the city center.

5095083,453282090,5/15/2019,"Leo is a great host, very communicative and knowledgeable of the Dublin area. We had plenty of space in our room, and the common areas he shared were a bonus for us. His place is very convenient to Connolly rail station, bus services and LUAS. Much of city center is within 15 - 20 minutes walk if you prefer not to take a bus.
We would definitely stay there again when we visit Dublin."
5095083,453646395,5/16/2019,"Leo's place couldn't be more conveniently located. It's well priced, clean, and quiet. Leo communicated promptly and clearly. The normal check-in time is unusually late, so guests will want to make sure it suits their schedule (as it did mine) before booking."

5095083,507085761,8/11/2019,Leos appartement is een prettige locatie op een prima plek. Vanaf hier is vrijwel alles te lopen. Let wel je hebt een eigen kamer en badkamer in het appartement van de eigenaar. Bij ons was de eigenaar niet thuis dus was prettig en gaf meer privacy. Verder heel gastvrij.
5095083,514032451,8/20/2019,"Leo is a friendly host, ready for a chat if you are or happy to leave you to your own devices. 

The apartment is well located (my partner and I walked everywhere) though a little fiddly to enter (Leo provides clear instructions).

The bed is on the small side for two large adults but it's nice to have your own ensuite."
5095083,516359323,8/24/2019,Perfect location. Great place to stay for a short stay.
5095083,518762356,8/27/2019,"The appartment is well located, the bed is comfortable and communication with the host was very efficient. 
However, check-in time is too late and the price is high considering you are sharing the appartment with the host (although he was not there often)."
5095083,521051134,8/31/2019,"It was a very pleasant stay. Leo sent exact information, so we didn¬¥t have any problems to take keys from the box. Great location for exploring the city. The apartment was nice, clean, fully equipped ( own bedroom, bathroom). We recommend to everybody!"
5095083,523810408,9/4/2019,"Sparkling clean and stylish. 
Leo let us in around 10 a.m. to leave our luggage, even if the official check-in is after 7 p.m.
Great position of the apartment. Airport bus station and supermarket in 2-3 mins range of walk.
Super silent neighbourhood. We could rest up to noon. No noise to disturb us. 
Great amenities. Well-equipped kitchen. 
Leo is very responsive and he doesn't bother you, even if he is at home. 
TOTALLY RECOMMEND HIM!"
5095083,526026423,9/8/2019,"The room was perfect, clean and with every comfort. The position is really good, a few steps from the Spire, so that we could visit Dublin on foot. the communication with the host was perfect,  fast and precise, the instruction were really precise.
Suggested!"
5095083,528038622,9/12/2019,"I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at Leo's place, which is centrally located, clean and tidy. Leo is a very good host and gave us accurate instructions on how to easily check-in, even though we arrived very late."
5095083,528481472,9/13/2019,"Wonderful place, close to the center and Leo is friendly and nice. He has good tips to eat and drink, (pubs, restaurants)."
5095083,529791732,9/15/2019,"My husband and I were very unimpressed by this rental. We arrived around 6pm and had an awful time finding our way to the room. Luckily there was a nice gal who lived in the building and she helped us find our way. If it wasnt for her, we would have never found it. Our key was left in a mailbox that was completely open and anyone could have grabbed it. I cant stress enough how UNSAFE this building is.. as a woman, I could never imagine coming here alone. Also, as we were walking in there was someone going the the restroom right outside the entrance. So that made sense why it smelt like urine everywhere. The building is absolutely disgusting. Once we finally found the room, we were welcomed by an awful smell in the hallway and the entire hallway was filled with toys and equipment, they must have been a neighbors but nonetheless,  it didnt leave much room for walking. Once we got into the SHARED apartment, there was stuff everywhere. The kitchen had probably 20 alcohol bottles out on the counter and the whole place just looked a wreck. After being in the apartment for all of two minutes we knew there was no way we could stay here. We ended up booking a hotel for two nights, that was not cheap but there was no price tag we could put on it. Save yourself the time and I would never even consider this place. I have never written and bad review on Airbnb, and we dont feel like we are picky travelers but we felt it was necessary to warn anyone that is considering staying here."
5095083,536205516,9/26/2019,"Freundlicher Gastgeber, gute Lage, sehr zufrieden.."
5095083,537983180,9/29/2019,This location is very close in walking distance to the Temple Bar area and its not far from the train. Very easy to get around in this location.
5095083,541468279,10/5/2019,"We had an amazing stay! Leo was so easy to communicate with, his instructions to find the location were clear.. We had no troubles at all. 
The space was clean and comfortable."
5095083,553437627,10/24/2019,"Leo's place is very conveniently located for exploring Dublin, close to the main tourist attractions. There are many nice cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood. Leo's place is clean and convenient and he gives very clear check-in instructions, so we  had no problem during our stay. Would recommend this place!"
5095083,559551009,11/4/2019,"Everything was perfect. Quiet, nice room. We had nice chats with Leo. We really enjoyed our stay."
5095083,562042239,11/10/2019,"-Location is convenient- about 15 mins walk to the other side of town for Dublin castle and everything else. 
-Bedroom is clean! And there were 2 outlet adaptors which was nice. I didnt need but could be useful for others. Heat available in room.
-Private bathroom in room was older but clean but had some hair in shower from last tenant? 
-I didnt use kitchen or living space, host had guest over. He informed me day of arrival. 
-Allowed early luggage drop off which was great
-Overall, decent stay and more affordable than other hotels in the area!"
5100676,419554361,3/4/2019,"The apartement is really great for a fun stay in Dublin - clean, quite, everything you need is in the apartement and most of the sightseeing places are in walking distance. A great place to stay and I guess we will be back."
5100676,422485950,3/11/2019,"Keith's place is very nice, confortable, and well located, and Keith is a very arranging guess.
Bonud: One of my friend's forgot his passeport, Keith found it before the flight and joined us asap so that we can take our flight!
Thank you Keith"
5100676,425885405,3/19/2019,"Its a very lovely little cottage. Our family of five was very comfortable there. The location is quite nice, easy walking distance to many tourist sites. We particularly enjoyed stumbling on all the antique shops around the corner on Francis Street. Our host was very kind and very communicative. We definitely enjoyed our stay."
5100676,427992805,3/24/2019,"Nice, clean and cosy cottage, 15mn walk from temple bar..."
5100676,431037279,3/31/2019,"Great location! 10-15 walk to pretty much everything but its also just removed enough that it feels like youre seeing a little of the locals Dublin. Fully functional kitchen, comfortable beds - we slept 5 with no issues - and plenty of seating which can be hard in an Airbnb! Not sure if Ill be returning to Dublin but if I do I hope Im able to book this place again!"
5100676,444715706,4/28/2019,"Keiths place was great! He made sure we had all the instructions we needed to fully use his space and the neighborhood around it. We enjoyed staying in the Liberties because it was further away from the noise of the busy streets in Dublin. We had 5 people staying so it was a little tight, but manageable. Keith was a great host!"
5100676,450118834,5/8/2019,"Great location, near enough to explore all of the city on foot but far enough out to be away from traffic and people noise. Parking immediately outside the house is metered and restricted so could be quite expensive if you have a hire car for your stay, but we found  a couple of nearby streets that were completely free. The house is well equipped with bedding, towels, clothes space and kitchen necessities. All in all a very pleasant stay"
5100676,451228896,5/11/2019,Our stay was great! The cottage was wonderful and very clean. A short walk to everything we needed. Everything was as described and checking in with the lockbox was very convenient. We loved this place and would definitely return.
5100676,458055947,5/25/2019,"House is located around 15 mins walk from some great shopping, pubs, restaurants etc. Be aware that the immediate area around the house isnt the most desirable, and you will need to take taxis at night. House was spotlessly clean, plenty of space upstairs but a little bit cramped for our group of 6 downstairs."
5100676,459264608,5/27/2019,"Had a great stay at this house with my friends. Lovely place, very clean & really good location. Highly recommend!"
5100676,461249964,5/31/2019,"Nice place in old Dublin near the Guinness storehouse, the brazen head pub and many nice stops and food items. Gets one out of tourist central with a more local experience."
5100676,462436899,6/2/2019,Great stay in a great location.
5100676,465822301,6/8/2019,"Fabulous location! Everything we needed for a great stay. We appreciated the extra linens, few more pillows, throws on the beds. We were grateful that we could drop luggage early."
5100676,469195001,6/14/2019,The layout of the apartment having to go through the kitchen to access the toilet was less than ideal.  The area is very residential with limited eating options for dinner without a decent walk. For the price its ok
5100676,471307809,6/17/2019,Very quiet residential area and yet not far to many sights and Temple Bar.
5100676,472261912,6/19/2019,"Decent place for the price. Living room is fairly spacious, but other rooms are small.  Electric shower was loud and small, with limited amount of hot water. No soap or shampoo provided, so make sure you bring your own. Location was walkable to St Patricks, Temple Bar, etc. More hostel than hotel, so set your expectations and it's fine. Checking in and out was easy, no problems there."
5100676,473728316,6/22/2019,"Its hard to beat the location of Keiths place!  Its super easy to walk to stores, public attractions, pubs, etc.  The people in the Liberties neighborhood are really incredible and friendly.  The bathroom set up worked particularly well for us.  The toilet and sink are separated from another sink and the shower so you can easily stay here with a group without feeling the pain of 1 bathroomù.   The flat was clean, well appointed and Keith responded super fast if needed."
5100676,475552590,6/24/2019,"Keiths place was perfect for our group of 5 to spend a few days in Dublin. Overall the place has everything you would need packed into a small townhome. Also, the location was good, anywhere near the city center could be reached by a quick bus ride."
5100676,476861462,6/27/2019,Excellent location if you dont have a car. Just a 6 minute walk to Teeling Distillery and an 8 minute wall to Guinness. Apartment is clean and quiet and there are plenty of restaurants and pubs to walk to.
5100676,481639677,7/5/2019,Clean and good logation
5100676,490345333,7/18/2019,"Nice, quiet space that is an easy walk to wherever you want to go. Place was clean and fit the four of us easily. Very much enjoyed our stay."
5100676,502201095,8/4/2019,"It was very easy to check in, since the was in a combination lock with the key on the door. 
I had some troubles with my booking and Keith contacted the Airbnb support immediately and sorted it out. The cottage was really nice, supermarkets were really near by and also some great local stores, bakery etc. 
Our neighbour in the cottage was also really nice, he waited for us to come out in the morning to give us informations about the city and a map where he marked his suggestions. Over all we had a really pleasant stay there with our family!"
5100676,510055706,8/15/2019,Great stay in Dublin! We had more then enough space and it was a great location to walk to all the main attractions.

5100676,524231820,9/5/2019,"It's an amazing cottage, the kitchen is spacious and has all the utensils you need, the only complaint is that if there are 6 people it may take a while with only one bathroom but otherwise great!"
5100676,524546358,9/6/2019,Lovely little stylish and cosy place to stay. Not too far from all the sites. Would recommend!

5100676,537843411,9/29/2019,We had a great stay here. Everything was clean and plenty of towels were provided. We were able to drop our bags early which was a huge help. We were given local recommendations for food/live music and the location was prime walking distance to everything we wanted to see.
5100676,540841876,10/4/2019,"This house is perfectly located for a trip to Dublin. You can walk to the city center.  It is quite tiny , but was ok for 4 adults and a child. Thanks"
5100676,543718613,10/8/2019,We had a great time at the very central appartement! The rooms are all thought-out and there is place in the tiniest corner. There is just a five minute walk to the Guiness Storehouse and 10 min to the other direction to the Temple Bar!
5100676,545002594,10/11/2019,"My family and I stayed here for a few days and the location is fantastic, we walked everywhere! There was 6 of us so it was a bit cramped but we were hardly there so it worked out fine."
5100676,546975225,10/14/2019,"Very comfortable and quiet place,  perfect for walking into the city centre"
5100676,562027235,11/10/2019,"Well located spacious property within easy reaching distance of all main attractions.

Easy to get to the Luas - which was then 10-15 mins to the city centre. 
Really handy Tesco store next door as well as a lovely butchers, pharmacy and off licence. 
Lovely welcome gifts! Thank you"
5122717,459441849,5/27/2019,"A fantastic spot, located in a lovely part of Dublin. The parade of shops were perfect for picking up any amenities and some lovely local produce. Perfect for a weekend break for couples."

5122717,506992940,8/11/2019,We had a fantastic couple of days in Rathmines. The flat was a perfect base for us to visit friends and see a bit of Dublin. We really appreciated the little touches...fresh food in the fridge. Would definitely recommend
5122717,515101492,8/22/2019,"Elaines apartment is beautiful, its clean and modern. The location is great if you want something close to the centre but quiet at night. 

There is a tram stop (Luas) just a 10min walk from the apartment.

The apartment is set in a nice, suburban area with good restaurants and shops nearby. 

Elaine was friendly and welcoming when we arrived to check in and helped us with local transport and restaurant recommendations throughout our stay. 

We would stay again if we were back in Dublin."
5122717,519894949,8/29/2019,Everything was fine. I appreciated the extra effort to make sure my motorcycle was safe overnight.

The place was better than described with the personal touches that we received when we arrived, it was clean, modern and just like home from home. No issues what so ever and we would definitely stay again. Elaine and the other staff that we met were very friendly and welcoming...thank you again guys!!"
5122717,565225790,11/17/2019,"Elaine was amazing. She had the place perfectly prepped, and heated for us upon arrival. She had a safe and free place to park for our rental car. The space is conveniently located over a pharmacy and deli/grocery so you can get everything you need. The other tenants were a little loud, the doors do slam from time to time, but nothing a little white noise machine couldnt fix. The area is very safe and its about a 20/30 minute walk into city Centre. I would highly recommend this space!"
5122717,566967033,11/21/2019,"Everything was ok, easy check in and check out, the apartment was super clean. Elaine answer my questions really quick.

Beds are comfortable, furnishings are nice.  Elaine and the folks at the pharmacy below truly are super-hosts as they are super helpful and kind.  Made us feel at home.  Sophie went the ""extra mile"" one morning in helping us call a cab and giving us directions.  We were so appreciative!  The space is clean and well apportioned.  Of note is that there is a flight of stairs to navigate and parking is a 6-7 minute walk away.  Also be sure to bring a sleep mask if you are in the back bedroom as the summer nights are long and there is a skylight."

The location is fantastic: close to the city centre by bus and a short stroll away from the bustling town of Rathmines where there is lots of choice of excellent restaurants and shops as well as many beautiful examples of the Georgian architecture for which Dublin is famous. Check in was very straightforward. The apartment was clean and comfortable and Elaine had very thoughtfully left some food essentials for us on arrival.

Handy to have the use of a parking permit when our daughter came to stay. We very much appreciated the welcome pack of eggs, bread, butter, orange juice and milk. Good communication from Elaine. The only thing we feel needed attention was maybe its time to change the mattresses. Would definitely recommend staying here."
5123315,560929004,11/8/2019,"Absolutely loved our time in this apartment. It was very clean, cosy, and in a good location.

5140160,419010750,3/3/2019,"We had a lovely couple of days staying at Elaines place. Every thing for the stay had been thought of along with some  basic essentials like milk bread and butter. 
This place is great for a cheeky weekend to see a concert (like we did) or for a whole week as you have everything you need. Only a short walk to the bus stop which will take you in to Dublin and there are local shops nearby to pick up groceries. 
We have spoken about returning to Dublin later this year and will hope to stay at Elaines Place. Thank you all."

We had a greate view over the Skyline of Dublin and the bus stop to get to the city center was 5 minutes away.
The Apartment isnt the biggest, but the mirrors do a greate job."

5140379,450115694,5/8/2019,"If you want a place that isnt in the center of the city and is more laid back/quiet, this is it! Very cute neighborhood and I loved that we could walk to the Tesco to buy bottles of water and some snacks for our day trips. A liquor store and pizza place were also within walking distance so this was great after our late flight in. The apartment is a little hard to find at first and our cab drivers had trouble finding it at times. The apartment is actually quite spacious for Europe.ù Having two bathrooms was also great and a wonderful welcome package!"

 It was extremely clean and the landlord was amazing! They allowed us to check in early and even provided us with a very thoughtful welcome basket which included eggs, milk, bread,  orange juice and Irish butter!

The place had more than enough room for all of us! And two bathrooms! They also provided us with a very helpful booklet that describes all the local areas of interest. 

It was a short distance from a supermarket and a mailbox to mail  postcards!  

Taxi service to and from the apartment was easy and it was also within walking distance of very good local restaurants. if you are up to a 40 minute walk, you can walk to the temple bar area!

This is rental is a treasure and a gem! You won't be sorry for staying here!"
5140379,469772195,6/15/2019,"This apartment provided the perfect amenities for our stay in Dublin.

Myself, my two children and my husband stayed at Elaine's at the end of our trip just before flying home. This apartment is perfectly appointed for a family of four and is MUCH better than staying in a hotel.  Everything we needed was in the suite (including laundry!).  The location was amazing.  Rathmines is a very safe family friendly neighborhood and is only a quick train ride to the heart of Dublin.  There were some essentials (milk, juice, bread and eggs) left for us which made for a quick and easy breakfast before we headed out to explore Dublin.  You will not be disappointed with this accommodation!"

5140379,544085027,10/9/2019,"Elaine does a great job of being available, helpful and extremely thoughtful without being at all intrusive. We arrived a day late due to a problem with our aircraft, we were wiped out, and she left goodies outside the door while we took extended naps. 

The apartment is in a safe, quiet area with a little row of shops nearby - small Tesco supermarket, liquor store, cafe, greengrocer, etc. The bus is around the corner, and the luas tram is a few minutes further in the other direction - the two made it super easy to get to/from excursion departure points, Temple Bar, and all the major sites. It was my mother's first AirBnB experience and she was delighted."

5140379,552315938,10/21/2019,"This is a great flat in an excellent location in one of South Dublin's loveliest neighbourhoods.  It was very convenient - a short walk (4 mins) from the nearest supermarket, and only about 8 mins' walk to the Luas - where you can catch the Green Line into central Dublin.  The flat is bigger than it looks in the photos - and it has amazing views over the city.  Elaine and her team could not have been more helpful with booking and any queries, and the little 'welcome pack' of food was a really lovely touch.  Elaine was even able to provide a parking permit, which was really helpful.  Highly recommended!"

5166238,428589027,3/25/2019,"Ann is a wonderful and thoughtful host. She lives in the house and so knows all about the neighbourhood and is there to speak to if you need anything. She helped me with tips about local sights, dining options, and sightseeing recommendations not always in tour guides. She was most helpful and accommodating - when I needed a late check-out. I had a wonderful and homely experience.

Ann's home is in a quiet, residential neighbourhood. It is well connected by buses to Dublin city centre (about 20 minutes on the bus, and 2-3 minutes to get to the bus stop). Bus #16 gets you to her place straight from the airport, although it takes about 80-90 minutes."
5166238,473152687,6/21/2019,Ann's home in Dublin was my home away from home. I enjoyed my stay very very much. Ann is extremely caring and jovial. Her spirit and concern for guests is exemplary.

The tram station is just next to the door. You can also walk to the city. We will definitely come back if were in Dublin. Lovely home. 
Regards, Jakob & Lavanya"
5198526,479755193,7/1/2019,"Our stay with Gerard was excellent! Despite being away on business, he was able to keep us comfortable and informed about everything that was going on locally. He also made sure to give us several contacts so we had someone close by to call if we had a problem. The apartment was very clean and in a great location literally across the street from the tram shops. Would absolutely stay with him again!"
5198526,484035410,7/8/2019,"It was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't of picked better host! We felt more than welcomed with breakfast and tiny touches! The tram is just outside and made our festival experience smooth and easy! Although we didn't get to meet Gerard, his communication from afar was great! We had no problems and he made sure we had everything we needed and more! It was such a relaxing experience, I would highly recommend to everyone i know!"
5198526,498210425,7/29/2019,"Gerard is a great host and very helpful! Lovely flat, great location, would definitely stay there again!"
5198526,502990582,8/5/2019,"Gerard was super friendly and helpful, gave us a lot of useful information and provided us with food and drink in the fridge. The house is really clean and cozy, would definitely recommend it."
5198526,518291851,8/26/2019,Gerard was very informative and helpful with local recommendations and navigating through the city center.  He communicated very well up front and throughout the duration of the stay.
5198526,521633930,9/1/2019,"Gerard is a really friendly host, he gave us loads on information about Dublin, he was very understanding of us checking in late the first night and overall it was a pleasure to stay in his property. I can't recommend it enough."
5198526,525860644,9/8/2019,"Gerard was the perfect host. His place is lovely and a perfect choice, if you are looking to visit and explore Dublin.
Easy check-in and check-out. Perfect hospitality and support. Many useful tips about public transportation, restaurants and pubs, sights and interesting places."
5198526,530085588,9/15/2019,"Great space and Gerard had lots of thoughtful touches with breakfast foods, toiletry items, and local tips. Easy check in and very close to tram station. He responded to our queries quickly and his home was a great place to get some rest. :) Would recommend."
5198526,533934302,9/22/2019,"Such a great location and host, probably the best air bnb Ive ever stayed in!!"
5198526,551416337,10/20/2019,What can I say? I always keep coming back to stay at Gerard's beautiful abode. There is good reason why he is  a super host. He's very hospitable and welcoming with plenty of tips on what to do and see around Dublin and all over Ireland. There simply isn't enough space for me to write all the pros of staying at Gerard's place. You simply must experience it to believe it but book it before someone else does you'll be glad you did. I will be back. Cheers.
5198526,555914901,10/28/2019,We had a lovely stay by Gerard in Dublin. The apartment is brand new and tidy with breakfast prepared for us. We got also a lot of usefull tips. Can only recommend!
5201720,421878609,3/10/2019,"Nice, small apartment. Nice area. 20 minute walk to city centre"
5201720,426177987,3/20/2019,Right in downtown Rathmines it was a great location. Walls were thin and people came in and out of the other apartments in the middle of the night. The room got extremely hot and the heat was kind of difficult to figure out. Also the hot water does not last very long. It was still usable for us as we only stayed a few days and basically only slept there. Value and location are great.
5201720,449308454,5/6/2019,"Good value, great location."
5201720,456663589,5/22/2019,"Such a cool place to stay. Good space, good bed, gook kitchen.
Maybe the bathroom it's a bit small but it's ok for 2 people.
The position it's super comfortable, markets bus stops and all you need are very near the house.
Bernard was so helpful and give us all information about check in and the uso of the house very quick.
Very reccomended, will be back in future probably!"
5201720,463427521,6/3/2019,Bernard and the room itself was great! Awesome location!
5201720,469354443,6/14/2019,"Clean, compact studio apartment in a lovely area of Dublin. Easy walks to town and lots of local shops and restaurants."
5201720,474638550,6/23/2019,Very nice flat with all you need to spend a nice trip To Dublin
5201720,479619051,7/1/2019,"Great place, close to the city, clean, great host"
5201720,493363168,7/22/2019,The location suited myself as there many good eating places very close by & it was only a 20/25 minute walk into downtown Dublin .
5201720,498086187,7/29/2019,"Bernard is a great guy, very social and laid back. The apartment has a great location, easy to walk or take a bus to the city centre. The backyard is a great plus, the bed is rather small for two people but that's understandable given the space it's in. Kitchen is equipped with pots and pans and bathroom is adequate. I recommend this place."
5201720,508832185,8/13/2019,"It's well located, with many supermarkets and restaurants near by.  Bernardo is very attentive. The studio is small, specially the shower cabin, and it's in an old building."
5201720,513419598,8/19/2019,Todo correcto. Buen barrio y buenas conexiones. Hemos estado a gusto.
5201720,522584547,9/2/2019,Excellent place to stay with great connections to stay and no hassle checking in or out.
5201720,525142987,9/7/2019,everything ok!great location!
5201720,531769216,9/18/2019,"The location in Rathmines is actually quiet great, cause it's a neighborhood that you would normally maybe not explore. But it has great coffee shops , bars and a nice vibe and only 25 min walk to the super busy Temple Bar tourist nightlife district. 
The studio is clean but very tiny. Bernard provides coffee and tea which is nice. However the place should get some makeover to justify the high price. There is literally no decoration to make the space cozy and comfortable. The bathroom fan is super loud and needs fixing. Shouldn't be an issue hopefully by the time others book in the future. It's good for a solo traveler but almost too small for a couple and therefore I think the price is quite high for what you get. But it's a great neighborhood and definitely a good way to explore Dublin."
5201720,538102686,9/29/2019,"Great location, great host."
5201720,541696194,10/5/2019,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

5201849,425918561,3/19/2019,"Hello everyone, that was a lovely Saint Patrick's extended weekend at Bernard's. The place was just fine, above our expectations, not in the center but buses rode us there in 10 minutes. The room was just as it should be, maybe the bathroom wasn't that new and fresh but it's ok. Many shops around (Aldi, Lidl, etc) and cafes for breakfast. Ask Bernard for advice which traditional pub go to - it was just perfect! Thank you Bernard, good luck, cheers!"
5201849,431979257,4/2/2019,"The studio in a fantastic location - great part of town and close to everything you'd want to be close to.

Bernard was also very hospitable and helpful as a host, and the place was clean and tidy.

On the down side, the kitchen area is very small, it took a while for the hot water to heat up, and even after it had heated up it tended to run out pretty quickly."
5201849,435354314,4/10/2019,"Bernard is easy to communicate with and extremely helpful in terms of navigating around the city.
  The studio had much appreciated  coffee as well as tea  in the kitchen was quite useful. Conveniently located within a two minute walk of Plenty of restaurants and simply jumping on a bus to get to city Center which is only about a mile away was ideal as well."
5201849,437843071,4/15/2019,All excellent !! Thanks so much
5201849,445384496,4/29/2019,Great place
5201849,452866027,5/14/2019,Great location and pretty quiet for being on a buy street. The place was really small and the mattress wasnt very comfortable.
5201849,455230650,5/19/2019,"We had a rough start because we were told there might not be enough lock boxes for us to check in, so we were anxious if wed even be able to stay here! In the end it worked out fine thought even with our flight being nearly 2 hours delayed. The studio is small, but you can see that from the pictures. The bed is super comfy though and the duvet so soft. The location is a little out of the centre, but with good bus links. The hot water is an issue, you have to wait 20 minutes for the water to heat up, and then in the shower the temperature was fluctuating. Really hard when you have a busy day planned to get up 20 minutes earlier so you can have hot water for a shower... I probably wouldnt stay again unfortunately, I was just looking for a bit more for the amount we paid."
5201849,457035756,5/23/2019,Great location!
5201849,460019241,5/28/2019,"This apartment is small and dated. It has a queen size bed with one bedside table and a small table with 2 chairs.
The kitchen is a very small alcove with a range with 4 burners and an oven. There is a refrigerator, toaster and kettle as well as dishes, cutlery and pots and pans and a coffee press. There are also oil and salt. Bernard supplies tea, coffee and sugar.
There is a hair dryer.
There was usually no hot water in the kitchen or bathroom. One is supposed to press a button 2 hours before taking a shower in order to get hot water. The supply, when this is achieved, is short lived - one gets 2 to 3 minutes of hot water.
When there someone in the apartment above, one can hear their footsteps distinctly.
The apartment was clean, the linens good and there was a dish towel. There is a place to recycle glass, plastic and paper.
There is a back garden with flowers where there are picnic tables and a clothesline.
Bernard is a friendly and kind person.
The apartment seems expensive, although Dublin is a very expensive city."
5201849,465669784,6/8/2019,Bernard was a great host. Replied within 10 minutes after booking and allowed us to check in early. The place was clean and in a great location.
5201849,513892181,8/20/2019,"This is a great spot if youre looking for an authentic Dublin experience. It has all the basic necessities, but thats about it.

The bed is a double, but has a basic and well used mattress. The shower doesnt stay hot for long, but it works. No TV. 

Walking from here to the city center will take about 30 minutes if thats your plan. There are quite a few shops and restaurants / bars nearby the room if walking gets to be too much. That also means its loud though. Plenty of shouting people in the middle of the night and the kitchen exhaust fan from the falafel place in front is a fairly constant drone.

It was easy to find and Bernard was easy to get in touch with for check in."
5201849,523316393,9/3/2019,Excelent studio and location. Bernard was a nice host.
5201849,525727595,9/8/2019,Bernard was very helpful and quick to respond before and during our stay. The location was exceptional and very easy to get around from. Room was exactly as described. Would return in the future.
5201849,538825282,9/30/2019,"Bernard was a great host. The apartment was very well kept and the location is great, as you can gent to the city centre in a few minutes by bus. I few ever decide to come back to Dublin we will definitely repeat."
5201857,422545316,3/11/2019,Rathmines is amazing. Wonderful period house in a nice part of Rathmines. Plenty of places to go out. Friendly host. Good communication and easy access to the flat.
5201857,424270177,3/16/2019,Such a great place to stay! Great size with amenities and in a great location. The host was super friendly too!
5201857,425857010,3/19/2019,Great location
5201857,427976087,3/24/2019,Very easy and chill place to stay. One thing Id say is that I wish it was just a little bit closer to city center so we could have walked more. We ended up getting many taxis. Definitely make sure to wait the full 20 min before starting a hot shower. Otherwise this place was great to stay at especially if youre busy all day and just have a nice comfy place to come home to at night.
5201857,430880765,3/31/2019,"Bernard was always available to help us with our requests answering very quickly. The apartment is perfect for 2 people, clean and equipped with the essentials. Nearby there are supermarkets and restaurants and bus stops to the city center (reachable just in 15 minutes from the house)"
5201857,437864480,4/15/2019,"Location was top notch. Very walkable to lots of things. Cute backyard for when the weather allows. We had issues with the water pressure and the wifi but Bernard provided us with a discount to compensate which was fair enough to me. 
Kitchen had almost all the basics. Could use a sharp knife and cutting board (we struggled to cut some takeout sandwiches) but was pleased by the coffee and french press! All in all, I would stay here again."
5201857,448529137,5/5/2019,Great location . Still in the city but not too crazy busy . Great food and bars close by . We loved the black bird ( local pub ) Bernard recommend to us :) . Definitely would stay again .  Perfect space for 2 people :)
5201857,458679217,5/26/2019,"Bernard flat is very well communicated to the center by bus or a nice walk crossig the Portobello canal, the flat is very clean and bigger than you expect in the pictures, it has tea and coffee, etc and an incredible garden. Bernard answered all our questions very quickly and it was a peaceful sleep, no noise and comfy bed and pillows. Thanks again Bernard!"
5201857,462488890,6/2/2019,Bernard's place is in an ideal location. Approx 30 mins walking distance from Dublin City Centre and has lots of supermarkets and a movie theatre within 5 mins walking distance. The space is basic but has everything you need. The bed is  very comfortable. We definitely recommend!
5201857,467322182,6/10/2019,"We found the apartment very comfortable and situated in the perfect location for us. A straightforward walk of 30 mins or so into the centre or an easy bus ride. There are some excellent restaurants on the route too. The building is set back from the street which is nice, but the sound does come through - dulled enough for most, but bring sleeping tablets if you are a light sleeper. The apartment is clean and has everything you need. We had no trouble heating the water in advance for a shower. All in all highly recommended."
5201857,468721901,6/13/2019,The apartment was ideal as a base for a short break but also cosy enough to spend plenty of time in. Bernard provided a heap of useful information about transport links and local spots. Really handy for getting into town.
5201857,513336220,8/19/2019,"Great location, well serviced by buses but also a very easy walk straight into centre of town. Surrounded by plenty of pubs, bars and cafes. Bernard also provides extra towels and shower products, which is very handy. Basic but comfortable for a city stay when you are mainly out exploring"
5201857,538098661,9/29/2019,Lovely place would stay again!
5207710,425895874,3/19/2019,"The house is very clean and cozy. The shower is great, the beds are comfortable. We just had a little problem to get a taxi because it was San Patricks day and the city was crowded. It costs about 10 euros to get to the center. I highly recommend Orla's house."
5207710,430914542,3/31/2019,"Very pleasantly surprised at the accommodation, three spacious doubles, nice living area and kitchen, handily placed for all our needs. Orlando was a great host, very communicative and nothing was too much trouble for her. Left us a package of food and milk which was very welcome. Amenities are excellent would not hesitate to recommend"
5207710,433990459,4/7/2019,House was homely with comfy beds and nice/clean bedrooms. Lovely to have breakfast and coffee supplied. Description above is accurate!
5207710,439041601,4/18/2019,"A great stay! I was in town for work and Orla was wonderful! Upon check in, she called with a list of local recommendations for places to eat, shop, etc. When we had some hiccups with the heater system, she was quick to reply to my texts and was very helpful. Thanks so much Orla!"
5207710,452563609,5/13/2019,"Orla's house was really nice and cozy with a very nice style, and the beds were very comfy. We enjoyed staying there :) We had to check in quite late, which was no problem with the keybox and the given instructions, also Orla sent a lot of tips on how to get there beforehand. Inside, we got a lot of information about restraurants and sightseeing in Dublin, which was very helpful to us. Unfortunately, we did not meet Orla in person, due to our late arrival, but she always responded very quickly and explained everything to me. I would recommend her house at any time!"
5207710,462820373,6/2/2019,"Had an amazing time in Dublin. Orlas place was fantastic!  Great communication with the host, no troubles with checking in or finding the place. Immediately felt at home at Orlas house. Highly recommended!"
5207710,470672617,6/16/2019,"Three bedrooms in cozy house , two upstairs and one downstairs
No washroom upstairs
Pleasant and helpful hostess
Probably a good price for Dublin
Enjoy"
5207710,477520702,6/28/2019,Thanks Orla for the pleasant & smooth stay in Dublin!
5207710,478978871,6/30/2019,"This property's principal selling point is that it has three bedrooms which makes it ideal for friends who prefer not to twin share (or sleep) on a sofa bed. The location is not particularly chic, but is quiet."
5207710,489162300,7/16/2019,"Our living in Orla's house was great. The house is  cozy, sweet and (Website hidden by Airbnb) an authentic working class Irish neighborhood...! Everything was really great..!"
5207710,493355763,7/22/2019,"Orla was a great help with any questions we had and very accommodating. Her home is a bit of a walk from the tourist part of the city, which is what we wanted. You can catch the bus right down the street but we choose to walk, its about a 25 min walk.  There is a fabulous little cafe right down the road that you have to try, their breakfast was fabulous!"
5207710,505325208,8/9/2019,The house is a lovely accomadation. It is located not far from the city centre and has several shopping possibilities nearby. You can find a lot of information about things to do in Dublin within the living room.
5207710,518333457,8/26/2019,Three nice bedrooms. Very comfortable common room. Easy walk to the city. Kitchen small but functional. Orla super easy to work with.  Dublin is super busy so nice to be a little outside the city.
5207710,521631535,9/1/2019,Orla ha sido muy amable  guardar las maletas despues de la salida de la casa hasta nuestra salida del avion. Gracias tambien por toda la informacion prestada y la comida disponible. Gracias por tu hospitalidad.

5209247,425493778,3/18/2019,"Catherine's place is great located, in a calm part of Dublin. Near (5min by foot) to the DART train stop, and 15min by Taxi from Airport. This allowed us a stress-free celebration of St. Patrick's Day without paying a fortune for the night."
5209247,504228593,8/7/2019,"Great stay. Highly recommendable host.
Initially we hat some doubts about a room with curtains (instead of a door), but it was not at all a problem."

5218203,424909874,3/17/2019,"Could not recommend higher for new arrivals to Dublin! Warm, comfortable, clean and quiet with good access to the Public transport system. Absolutely perfect for anyone needing accomodation whilst settling in, or exploring the city!"
5218203,439096253,4/18/2019,"The room is quiet, comfy and very clean and Estelle and Alan are wonderful hosts. They indeed provide a warm welcome and staying here feels not like having a place to sleep but rather like having a second home. Also Leo the dog is a sweetheart. <3 Couldn't recommend more!"

5251419,439099400,4/18/2019,"James was the perfect host leading up to and during our trip. We stayed at his property for almost 2 weeks and could not have been happier with the experience. 

This was our first time traveling out of the country with our (almost) 2 year old. We were thrilled to find a space that was so accommodating for children. James answered all of my questions about car seats, strollers, cribs and more. He responded quickly and thoroughly each time. 

When we arrived James arranged for some tasty cheese, wine and bread to be set out, which made us feel right at home. The space was clean and bright, and exactly as described. 

We were thrilled with how close to the City Center the property was and how easy it was to access the bus and the train. 

If we ever return to Dublin we will absolutely stay here again."
5251419,440930369,4/21/2019,"Perfect place to experience Dublin from-especially with young kids. They had all the necessary things to make traveling with a baby or toddler a breeze. There is a beautiful and huge park 5 minute walk from the house. The city center is walkable and bus lines are close. Necessary kitchen supplies were provided in addition to coffee, a bottle of wine, cheese, Irish butter, and bread. We would certainly stay there again."
5251419,446448429,5/1/2019,A great stay!  The house is well designed and decorated with helpful kitchen / children's toys and equipment provided.  It's in a very safe and friendly neighbourhood and provides easy access on foot / public transport / car to the city.  Free parking is a massive bonus.  Angie who checked us in was so helpful and friendly and was available to answer any questions over the phone and (if needed) in person.  James' communication was A1 as well when booking / arranging our stay.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend  booking here.
5251419,447941005,5/4/2019,"Jamess place was perfect for us! The spaces were comfortable and we appreciated the thoughtful touches (wine, cheese, bread). James was not in town so arranged for his neighbor Angie to be at hand - she was lovely and helpful and like James, gave us great tips and suggestions.

The place was in a perfect location for us - just outside the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk everywhere, including the train station to Galway and an excellent art museum and huge public park minutes away. It was quiet, felt very safe, and super charming.

You must try Ryans Bar (Jamess suggestion) for the Guinness, mussels, and burgers - superb suggestion.

Thank you James! We hope to return again!"
5251419,449344622,5/6/2019,"Excellent location, clean home"
5251419,451784316,5/12/2019,Brilliant stylish place and super location.
5251419,458058894,5/25/2019,"We had a nice stay at James place in Dublin. Great for exploring the city and Phoenix Park. My two and a half year old especially enjoyed all the toys available! James and Angie made sure we had everything we needed for him and our 6 month old tooîbaby gates, stroller, high chair, booster seat. 

The bus service into the city was quick and efficient (about a 10 minute walk to the stop). Taxis were less than 15 euro. 

Thanks James!"
5251419,482233232,7/6/2019,Leuke en rustige locatie op wandelafstand van de belangrijkste toeristische attracties van Dublin. De inrichting van het huisje is prima in orde. James is een geweldige gastheer; heel attent en reageert heel snel op communicatie. Kortom; een aanrader!
5251419,484669839,7/9/2019,A terrific place to stay when in Dublin - car park outside the door and right across from a great park and the Zoo - short walk into the centre of Dublin and also close to station and bus depot . Lovely touches and everything there that I needed.  The wine bread and cheese were also lovely. Thanks James

5251419,494369024,7/24/2019,"We didnt meet James, but we met Angie who takes care of the property, she was very helpful giving us tips on where to go and do. She has a great personality that makes you feel welcome and at home. The location is away from the hectic city but really close to Phoenix  park. I highly recommend this place for families.  They left toys, a gate and books for our little girl. The room were spacious and perfect for the three of us.

It was in a great location, only a few minutes cab ride to downtown or about a 15-20 minutes walk. We had a very nice night's stay here. If you have a car, the parking situation is a bit difficult as it's either park on the metered street (if you can find a spot) or to park in the nearby parking garage and pay the 40 Euros per night fee."

5255969,435057525,4/9/2019,"Lovely apartment with everything we needed. Robbie made a cup of tea for us which was deeply appreciated since we'd just arrived in Ireland.  He told us about the neighborhood and the local restaurants as well as a fabulous pub that we visited that evening. 

The bed is superbly comfortable - we rested very well and found the neighborhood to be extremely quiet at night. The duvet kept us warm and snug. The shower is adequate with plenty of hot water.

The apartment itself is tastefully decorated, very clean, and in a great location - an easy walk to bus stops, Pearse station, and Temple Bar. 

I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Robbie again if I ever have the good luck to visit Dublin again."

5255969,453562305,5/16/2019,We had kind of an unusual experience as Robby was on vacation and we've had the whole house for ourselves. Maybe due to Robbies absence we were a little disappointed with the breakfast as there was no coffee and any other bread spread then jam. The location itself was very central and good value for money. We however were surprised about the high costs for parking (40 euros for a day)

5255969,471322609,6/17/2019,Robbie has a great apartment. Easy walk into centre of the city and most sightseeing spots. We were at a music gig at the RDS and it was only a 25 minute walk.

Robbie was very kind, showed us around his apartment, offered us tea/coffee and the opportunity to make breakfast before we left (which unfortunately we didnt have time for but it was very sweet to know the offer was there).

5255969,496411912,7/27/2019,"Robbie is very kind and friendly. He helped us over the phone to find his apartment building when we got ourselves turned around in a new city.

Elevator is a bonus for sure."

His apartment has a beautiful view and it is about a 30 minute walk from the city centre. There is a hop on hop off tour stop next to the hotel which is just down the street from the apartment. It was a fun tour, and it was a good way to get around."

5257024,459395924,5/27/2019,We had a great time at Yasmine and Colins place. The location was great and the accommodations are exactly as described- great value for 4 people.
5257024,460801304,5/30/2019,We had a great stay in Dublin at this apartment. It was well stocked with many kitchen provisions that made preparing meals easy. The hosts were wonderful with communicating prior to checkin and made sure we were happy throughout our stay. We had our toddler with us and they left a few personal touches for her as well which made everyone feel welcome. Would highly recommend. Theres a nice park across the street at the St. Audeons Church.
5257024,465664596,6/8/2019,Lovely experience.
5257024,467971732,6/11/2019,"Great apartment close to the major sites of Dublin. A perfect jumping-off point for numerous day trips as well. Comfortable, clean, and free parking. Highly recommend!"
5257024,469189021,6/14/2019,Spacious appartment on a excellent location. Owners respond quickly and are not so strictly about arrival and leaving the appartment.
5257024,471418061,6/17/2019,"Great location.  5 minute walking distance to everything, but still a nice quiet street.  Great view from the balcony.  You do have to climb stairs to get the residence, no elevators, but this was not a downside for us.  Television had Netflix, which was a great bonus (especially since I spent a whole day inside when I became sick)!  Showers were great.  Host supplied us with Shampoo/Conditioner, towels, and hand wash.  Balcony is great to enjoy a cup of coffee on in the morning.  Hosts were very communicative and helpful. You will not be disappointed staying here."
5257024,474432054,6/23/2019,"This flat was charming, lovely, ideally situated near all the best that Dublin has to offer, esp. close to 2 Airlink 747 stops if anyone is taking the bus from the airport (and you should def take the bus because it's like getting a mini tour of Dublin centre). And Yasmine and Colin were wonderful hosts--very detailed, thorough, and helpful. I was flummoxed by how to deadbolt the doors and about the wifi and called and Colin walked me through everything (in Ireland you lift the doorhandle up and then do the deadbolt--not something I'm familiar with as an American). Would highly recommend this flat to folks looking."
5257024,478940606,6/30/2019,"Fantastic location-10 to 20 minutes to walk to all major sites in Dublin! Also very close to some good restaurants and grocery. The park outside St. Audeon's Church, across the street, gave a beautiful quiet space in the middle of the city. As teachers, we loved being next to a school. Great size for 2 adults and a teenager."
5257024,487851667,7/14/2019,Great apartment! Short walks to just about everything in Dublin! Hosts were great and very informative!
5257024,488448902,7/15/2019,The host canceled this reservation 79 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5257024,489687363,7/17/2019,"We had a very good stay in this apartment.  it is ideally located, perfectly clean."
5257024,497234239,7/28/2019,"Great location!  Yasmin and Colin are wonderful to work with - responsive, helpful, etc.  Everything was awesome though the beds could be more comfortable."
5257024,500602196,8/2/2019,"Loved the location, quiet neighborhood that was walkable to everything we wanted to do.  The apartment was very clean and as described.  It was the perfect size for our family of four."
5257024,507121444,8/11/2019,"This place made for a great stay in Dublin. The directions to his place were spot on and the place was really lovely for our stay, in terms of style and cleanliness. Note that this place is a climb up a few flights of stairs, and that there are several codes for parking in case you have your own car (and this might be a challenge if you are travelling solo with a car). Make sure you get all three codes from this host at the beginning to ease your exit and entry into the car park (and to avoid communication delays)."
5257024,512312647,8/18/2019,Wonderful place in a great location
5257024,516387114,8/24/2019,Great location and great hosts. They are quick to respond by phone/email. Apartment is on the third floor and stairs only so my be an problem for some people with mobility issues. Over all great for families as they do have crib/highchair/toys.
5257024,518277633,8/26/2019,Great location - walking distance to and from everything in and around Dublin that you would want to see. Great communication by the hosts
5257024,523740005,9/4/2019,"Apartment was in a great location.  Walked to everything, no need for public transport or taxis (other than airport).  Was clean and comfortable and Yas and Colin were very responsive and helpful"
5257024,534981108,9/23/2019,"Perfectly located, right in the city center, still very quiet. The apartment is huge, cozy and well equipped. Yasmine & Colin are perfect hosts, they even let us stay until late afternoon. Thank you for everything and hope to be back! :-)"
5257024,536653377,9/27/2019,Great location!  Easy access allowing us to explore the city.  In addition the Neighborhood people were friendly and welcoming to visitors.  Very enjoyable time.  Only recommendation it to bring your own washcloth!
5257024,538918894,9/30/2019,"We had a wonderful weekend with our girlfriends in this modern, clean and wonderful apartment just about five minutes away from Temple Bar, the Heart of Dublin.
Everything was prepared, the keys, the beds, It was extremly clean and we could enter the apartment without problems.
I recommend it strongly because it is at the heart of the city, 5 minutes walk to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and O'Connell Street.
The owners, even if we didn't met them, we just called each other and the guys were fantastic.
If you search for a cheap, modern and clean Apparment in the best Location possible please give the guys a message or a call.
You won't regret it!"
5268615,434101181,4/7/2019,"The location is good , it is quiet and next to the tube. Also we had our own balcony. We got everything we needed like iron , hair dryer , even morning breakfast! Id recommend "
5268615,435704769,4/11/2019,"Riham was especially helpful to us by extending check in times due to our very late arrival.  This was really appreciated but it also meant we had little personal interaction which was unfortunate.  But Riham's place was exactly as presented on line and we had no surprises and were made welcome to help ourselves to whatever was available.  All in all, a very positive experience for us.  Thanks Riham!  Kirby & Lynnette"
5268615,441881122,4/22/2019,"The Place: sparkling clean, extremely comfortable, provided amenities and toiletries, quiet and peaceful, although we rented a room Riham was not there and it felt as if the entire place was just for us. 
Communication: although Riham was not there during our stay, her and her friend were 100% responsive when we contacted them and had questions. There was no delay and we never had a problem or were left waiting. 
The location: I would make sure you know the public transportation very well as it can get expensive. Also, make sure you don't depend on one bus stop, there are others whiting walking distance. Make sure your flights are during the day during holidays (Irish are very catholic and keep certain days from working). Nevertheless, it is well connected with multiple bus stops around and the train. And, if you don't mind, you actually get to see the outskirts of Dublin. 
Overall, our experience was great and we definitely recommend the place."
5268615,442729641,4/24/2019,Belle chambre spacieuse
5268615,445426993,4/29/2019,Very good
5268615,450103136,5/8/2019,"I had requested for an early check-in to which Riham readily agreed. She personally welcomed us into her home. Clean house and bathroom, wifi, kitchen access is what I wanted and got. She has a very cute six year old boy who has many toys and willingly shared those with my little daughter. It was very sweet. The bus stop and train station are just within a minutes walk. Riham also prepared dinner for us when she got to know that it was our first day of fasting for Ramadan. May almighty bless her family."
5268615,457941450,5/25/2019,"We stayed with Riham for 10 days and she was very friendly and kind. Her place was cozy and clean, and she even offered complimentary breakfast every morning. Her place, though a little out of the city, is located near many bus tops and a train station, which is convenient. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay."
5268615,463971964,6/4/2019,"Clean ,tidy and also perfect location.
The bus to city center just right in front of the building. Riham is a really good host. The water pipe in the toilet was accidentally broken but she fixed it without taking too long time. Perfect place to stay in Dublin."
5268615,483132692,7/7/2019,Exactly as described. Basic room in an apartment with own bathroom (not en-suite). Very easy to train/bus. Took bus directly into the tourist area of the city center within 30 minutes. Easy to find and check in. Great value for a city with hostel beds going for over 50 USD each.
5268615,527598682,9/11/2019,"Riham is an excellent host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment was absolutely pristine and the room and bed were lovely and comfortable. Check-in was extremely convenient. Ideal location. I'd highly recommend Riham's place!"
5268615,531851594,9/18/2019,Riham was very accommodating and willing to work with me on my late booking and check in! Room was very clean and comfortable.
5268615,537791680,9/29/2019,Absolutamente recomendable.  Todo facilidades.  Gran anfitriona.
5268615,543662961,10/8/2019,"Very clean, quick responses. Good location."
5268615,547566621,10/15/2019,"Fairly basic, but worth the price.
Comfortable bed....quiet at night....continental breakfast.
Private bathroom was nice....good shower.
Good location....we had a car, but bus and train into Dublin very close by.
All in all, good value in an expensive city."
5268615,550687910,10/19/2019,It was perfect staying at Riham house. A comfortable room with free access to the kitchen its amenities. A bit far from the city centre but there is a train station in from of the condo. I home come back soon.
5268615,562677700,11/11/2019,"Excellent Airbnb. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and fit the description exactly. Riham was very kind and helpful throughout our stay. The bus stop was right next to the apartment building and transportation was easy to use. Definitely recommend staying here!"
5273761,418951150,3/3/2019,Such an amazing location and apartment!! Yvonne was so friendly and helpful. She picked us up from the airport and we were a bit delayed and had trouble with our luggages in the airport and she waited for us at the airport for over an hour. She showed us where to catch the train and bus and even wrote down the schedule for us. 10/10 recommend if you are looking for a location near the airport and for a friendly and very accommodating stay!
5273761,421996884,3/10/2019,"Extremely friendly host, gave us information about the city, and picked us up from the airport! Made our stay in Dublin very enjoyable."
5273761,431997353,4/2/2019,"Yvonne was a gracious host and made sure we felt comfortable. 
Sharing such a small space and being on our own vacation schedule, we tried hard to make sure that we didnt make noise when we came in or out. 
The beds were extremely uncomfortable, but it's a good place if you're only looking to sleep for a night. 
Plus its located right next to a diner and restaurant if you're tired and dont want to travel far or cook."
5273761,437055209,4/14/2019,"Yvonne was a fabulous host.  She picked me up from the airport and drove me there when it was time to leave.  The location is right next to the DART station so it's easy to get into town.  There is a pharmacy and convenience store as well as a few restaurants within a 5 minute walk.  I had tons of privacy and anything I needed was readily provided by Yvonne.  I had to pad my bed to make it more comfortable after the first night but afterwards, I spent the next 9 nights sleeping like a baby.  I would stay here again."
5273761,440895558,4/21/2019,"Yvonne war sehr nett und hat uns geholfen, ihre Mutter war auch sehr freundlich, als sie zu Besuch war. Die Stadtanbindung ist auch in Ordnung, unser Aufenhalt hat uns gut gefallen. Yvonne ist eine sehr freundliche Frau."
5273761,441911289,4/22/2019,Yvonne is a very friendly person. We even met her mother. They both are great fun. We just needed a place close by the airport to stay before we left early during the night. We were very happy to be able to stay.
5273761,442413717,4/23/2019,"Lovely apartment, very well located, nearby DART station and airport."
5273761,444569726,4/28/2019,We had a very pleasant stay! Great part of Dublin to stay in! Yvonne was quick to respond and helpful.
5273761,453234275,5/15/2019,"Yvonne was a friendly host, and it was wonderful that she offered to pick us up and take us to the airport for less than the cost of a cab ride! We appreciated the breakfasts, and her place is near a couple of little restaurant and right next to an affordable take-away spot. The part near her home is also lovely! Super easy to get into Dublin via bus (stops outside her building) or DART (very quick walk to station from her place)."
5273761,457123692,5/23/2019,"It's an amazing location, the bus stops in front of the building and comes every 10-15mins, takes you right to Dublin. The train is barely 5 minutes away and can take you all over Ireland. Yvonne (and her mother Bernie whom we met during check-in) we're very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. It was nice to be able to have breakfast every morning before we left, it saved us money and time for sure. Definitely a great place if you're looking for a bed to sleep in between days of activity and exploring. The apartment was clean and I felt comfortable leaving my things there while we ere out, use of the kitchen was wonderful and there were places nearby to grab food if needed. Highly recommend, would absolutely stay here again!"
5273761,458519044,5/26/2019,"We couldn't wish for more! Such a wonderful hospitality - cozy room, warm beds, great showers and easy reachable place. Yvonne is an amazing cook, so she prepared us divine vegetarian 3-course dinner. We are so lucky we could stay there for two nights. Highly recommend her to other travelers. :)"
5273761,459436681,5/27/2019,Yvonne is a nice host. Her place is very close to the airport. Thx for everything!
5273761,461393814,5/31/2019,Nice room and great breakfast!
5273761,462487312,6/2/2019,It was a very convenient location from airport.
5273761,464663381,6/6/2019,"We never  made it to Yvonnes because she changed the check in to 7pm and never communicated to me or Airbnb after that. As a result, Airbnb cancelled the stay"
5273761,470403364,6/16/2019,"We had a great stay at Yvonne's, who greeted us with tea on arrival. A nice breakfast was also served. The room was simple, but nice. Perfect for public transport connections into Dublin and Malahide and free parking in the area. 20 minute drive to the airport."
5273761,472353700,6/19/2019,Cute two bed room and a very friendly host. We could absolutely recommend this place. :)
5273761,473793397,6/22/2019,Located very convenient to DART station
5273761,474678302,6/23/2019,"Nice clean room, close to DART station and good value :)"
5273761,476014447,6/25/2019,Good location to Airport. Value for money with breakfast included.
5273761,478125393,6/29/2019,It was great
5273761,483286186,7/7/2019,Lovely apartment with great transport links to Dublin centre.
5273761,486835284,7/13/2019,"Perfect stay, easy to get there. Close to the city without the crowds. Yvonne was a great host."
5273761,489794847,7/17/2019,"Yyonne really nice person and met us really nice. Really good location and kitchen, she gave us a lot of food, is really nice. We had booking at last moment so she safeD us!"
5273761,492474343,7/21/2019,"Very functionnal , location great with bus transportation ! And SUPER host !!! We felt really welcomed !!!"
5273761,497243762,7/28/2019,"Yvonne will definitely try to accommodate your arrival/ departure time!
Yvonne's place is clean tidy and cosy, the bus that gets you within 15-20 minutes into city center stops opposite the house and is 3.30 one way.
There is a ""last of us experience"" (the game) if you like spooky half abandoned buildings (the park and right doesn't exist anymore but the car park does, it is hardly used and gives quite en eerie feeling, we somewhat walked in as we were looking for info on the park and ride - the elevator down worked, back up we had to find a non barricaded staircase - it honestly is a setting like in a zombie game).
However, you can use the boring parking :D park on street without charge.
It is a nice safe neighbourhood.
We had a splendid stay and would recommend it, if you aren't just in town to party as the last bus returns 11:30, but there is always taxis.

Tip: if you can avoid driving in Dublin, the street layout with bus lanes and co are on a different level."
5273761,504879765,8/8/2019,"Great place to stay.  It was easy to get to the city center, and it was a nice place to come back to after a busy day."
5273761,518342088,8/26/2019,A very tidy house and very hospitable and helpful host. Great value in a handy location
5273761,519387009,8/28/2019,As expected
5273761,523736870,9/4/2019,"A friend and I stayed with Yvonne for about a week and couldn`t have been wishing for a better housing for our trip to Dublin. 
Our flight was delayed so that we were arriving late at night, but Yvonne was so kind to pick us up from the airport even tho she had to work early the next day. 
The room was cosy and everything you could be needing was provided. The breakfast was more than we could have hoped for, with her providing different cereals, bread, spreads, marmelade and more. 
You need about 20-40 min. to dublin city center if you choose to go by public transportation, but there is a direkt route so that you don`t have to change busses or trains. 
Yvonne herself is a kind and attentive host, and always availabe for questions or anything else. 
We enjoyed our stay quite much and would recommend it to anyone."
5273761,527697373,9/11/2019,"Yvonne was amazing from initial contact to checking out, she was informative, hospitable, and friendly at all times, great experience, would highly recommend this bnb for future travelers"
5273761,529869002,9/15/2019,"An ideal location as its not too far from the airport. Just make sure you specify the address carefully to your taxi driver as he misunderstood us and dropped us off at the wrong address haha. 

Took us a while to settle in and get to know the area as it was our first time abroad, but a neighbour in the area was very kind and showed us on the bus to the city centre.

Yvonne arranges your breakfast all ready for you in the morning after your first night which is a lovely touch. Plus she was a legend dropping us off at the airport too :)"
5273761,547896183,10/16/2019,Great host altogether !
5273761,551529184,10/20/2019,"Strongly recommended. We spent great time at Yvonnes place 
She is very nice and kind"
5273761,553516496,10/24/2019,I had a great stay and I would recommend!!
5273761,554958938,10/27/2019,"Very clean and cosy space, Yvonne was welcoming and helpful. It's in a good location for the airport and going into Dublin centre."
5273761,568306852,11/24/2019,"Such a lovely host, caring and really kind, complimentary breakfast was amazing!"
5294824,418962763,3/3/2019,"We had a wonderful time there, the apartment was perfect for us and near city centre!"
5294824,427318916,3/23/2019,"aspectos positivos: 
el casero te resuelve rapidamente los problemas que te surjan
a pesar de estar lejos del centro, tiene buena comunicacion por bus
calefaccion perfecta
agua caliente de la ducha perfecta

aspectos negativos
colchon incomodo
a veces ruidoso por la cercania del tren
en general sucio, las sabanas estaban manchadas, no las habian cambiado. mobiliario con mal aspecto en general y no alcanza bajo mi punto de vista un nivel minimo de limpieza para sentirse agusto, yo tambien he alquilado mi alojamiento en airbnb y dejo mi piso impecable para el nuevo que venga"
5294824,428581799,3/25/2019,"The studio was perfect for our weekend stay, we walked everywhere, no need to take a bus, a train station to go to Howth is also nearby as well as a 24h bus to the airport (we took it in the middle of a night and it was a bit ahead of the schedule so it's better to go there a few minutes earlier). We didn't meet Rose and Brendan but they replied quickly to my messages and self check-in was really convenient because we didn't have to plan the time of arrival."
5294824,432983982,4/5/2019,Quick response and great location
5294824,444007967,4/27/2019,"Everything was clean and comfortable. The studio is near the airport and the city centre. I totally recommend this Airbnb, thanks a lot Rose and Brendan :)"
5294824,446377838,5/1/2019,"Rose & Brendan are very organized and make sure to give you all the information you need to get safely at the studio.
We had to call them to ask question and they were very responsive.

The studio location is very convenient: close enough to the city center but quiet enough to get some sleep, which is perfect."
5294824,449281144,5/6/2019,What a gem of a place! Clean and cosy! Rose and Brendan were fantastic :)
5294824,452562661,5/13/2019,"Very close to City centre with easy access by public transport as bus stop a short walking distance away.
Free street parking as long as you can get a spot close by.
Comfortable bed
Basic facilities but all that is needed if all you wanted was a place to stay and spend time exploring the city.
Wifi"
5294824,453998175,5/17/2019,Super sauber und freundlich!
5294824,455796524,5/20/2019,Very nice apartment. Small but with everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay and should I come back to dublin I will contact Rose and Brendan again 
5294824,456774898,5/22/2019,The place is quiet and you can walk to the centre. It's a bit tinier than expected but served the purpose. There is also a little shop down the street where you can buy some food.
5294824,466386233,6/9/2019,"The space is comfortable, very well located.  Public transportation os very close, although it is easy to do everything walking."
5294824,470509985,6/16/2019,"These hosts really go above and beyond, not to mention the room is furnished with everything we needed on our trip to Dublin. Got to save some money by cooling a few meals at the place. I would recommend this place to anyone."
5294824,472326745,6/19/2019,"It's great if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room.  There's no TV or sofa, but there is good wifi.  The location is near public transport, but we just walked everywhere.  There's some parts of town getting to the main area that are less than picturesque, but it was fine.  We took a cab a couple times when we got caught in a storm and it wasn't much money.  There's a little kitchenette which was wonderful to have with a grocer nearby, because by the end of our trip (we drove through the country ending in Dublin) we were absolutely sick of eating at restaurants."
5294824,475379441,6/24/2019,"The flat was very cosy and we a great Time in Dublin. Very close to the flat is a stadium , where you can go to a Hurling match if you are lucky. We really liked the idea of storing the keys in a safe outside the house . That way, you can arrive at any time.
The place is also great if you want to catch an early bus to the airport. It takes only 20 minutes."
5294824,476869531,6/27/2019,The space was a tad small but sufficed!
5294853,419123531,3/3/2019,"The accomodation is the perfect place to stay in Dublin.
 It has everything you need like a hairdryer, shampoo, a comfortable bed to sleep, towels and kitchen stuff. The check-in was very easy.
You only need 10 minutes by bus to the city centre (2,15‚Ç¨ single ticket), 3 minutes to the next shop und 5 minutes to the rail and bus station. It was great!"
5294853,420345499,3/6/2019,This was a perfect place in a great location. 20 minutes walking to the heart of the City Centre and very close to markets. Room was cozy and private.
5294853,427971068,3/24/2019,"Great and accommodating hosts. Responding very quickly to any questions. 
The location is great too, especially if you like walking and seeing parts of a city that are not only very central."
5294853,429922762,3/29/2019,Rose was very prompt with  her responses and no problems at all. The accommodation is in a great location and had everything we needed.
5294853,434098426,4/7/2019,"Rose and Brendans place was clean and safe (we travelled as 2 young women). It is very small but equipped with all the essentials - towels, French press, and the like. It isnt very difficult to navigate to the city center, in large part due to Rose and Brendans clear directions. FYI future travelers might consider a 48 or 72 hour pass for the buses. The heat does take a bit to kick on but we were quite comfortable throughout our stay. Very nice neighborhood and great suggestions for restaurants by Rose and Brendan!"
5294853,436581891,4/13/2019,great place and great people!
5294853,438300502,4/16/2019,"The apartment is in a wonderful location, steps from Croke Park with convenient walking access to restaurants, markets, buses and taxis.  It's within walking distance of the downtown tourist areas if the weather is nice and you want to stretch your legs, otherwise it's simple to catch a bus at the end of the street and set off for the day.  Amenities were perfectly suitable and made for a comfortable place to crash at the end of the day."
5294853,443094283,4/25/2019,Excellent accommodation and we easily walked to the city centre. Also found two great restaurants within easy walking distance.
5294853,443658780,4/26/2019,"Overall good place to stay for a night! The suite is small so for two people it can feel cramped. Not a big deal if you only plan on sleeping there. We only stayed for a night before our flight the next morning, but if you plan to stay longer and prefer space I would rethink this Airbnb. 

That said it had one of the nicer showers of all the Airbnbs we stayed in during our trip (even of larger spaces). 

Communication was A+."
5294853,445989039,4/30/2019,"Excellent value for money! 
Great location and comfortable bed. Great place if you only need a place to sleep and we would definitely come again. Thanks Rose and Brendan! :)"
5294853,449768997,5/7/2019,"Perfect place to stay for a weekend in Dublin! The apartment is right next to Croke Park, around 15-20 minute walk away from the main centre. The apartment was clean and tidy, and there was fresh bedding and towels. Thanks very much for letting us stay!"
5294853,450383021,5/9/2019,Location is outside of city center but is close enough to walk. Room was exactly what we needed for the couple nights we stayed.
5294853,452439269,5/13/2019,We love the studio and is near to the city center. Rose and Brendan are very kind
5294853,457519543,5/24/2019,"Very nice studio, near to Dublin City and to the Airport."
5294853,458735705,5/26/2019,Very close to Croke Park. Only really used it as somewhere to out iur heads down and have a shower and it suited our needs perfectly.
5294853,460101313,5/28/2019,It was a wonderful stay in a good very good area with easy access to downtown. Thank you for the hospitality.
5294853,468371585,6/12/2019,Quick easy access to croke park and easy to walk to most places
5294853,471907045,6/18/2019,"Basic, clean room with amenities. Would caution the bathroom is quite small, room 101 is at the front of the house on a reasonably busy street so there is some traffic noise. The fridge can be intermittently quite noisy also. The room suits a short term (1-2 nights), single person stay. Hosts are friendly and communication was very good."
5294853,473340953,6/21/2019,Good location
5294853,479745318,7/1/2019,We had a pleasant stay. The flat is smaller and less nice than it appears in the photos and a bit far removed from town.  The bed wasnt very comfortable. Overall its decent for the value and does have everything you need. Perfect if you are planning to spend most of the time out and around Dublin and we were and you have a car!
5294853,481143821,7/4/2019,"Rose and Brendan have a lovely location just north of the city center. They were quick to respond and left helpful and wonderful recommendations for places to go and eat. Thank you again, I really enjoyed my stay!"
5300081,418130377,3/1/2019,"Rosheen was a wonderful host and especially helpful with our relocation to Ireland. Her home is clean and the breakfast wonderful. Her home is located in an exclusive resort right at the beach, also located close to the train station, bus stops and airport. We enjoyed our stay with her."
5300081,421346402,3/9/2019,"We had a most hospitable stay with Rosheen and her family. We were greeted at the agreed upon time, showed our accommodations and treated to a lovely breakfast before our morning departure. Rosheen also recommended local restaurants and arranged a morning taxi for us. Thanks for everything!"
5300081,423147360,3/13/2019,Lovely room but it's a little too small (will be crowded if 3 persons were to stay in it).
5300081,425911550,3/19/2019,"The stay at Rosheen was great. The place was tidy and Rosheen is a great host. She was very helpful and offered fantastic recommendations regarding the surroundings. We felt welcomed all the time and would choose her again, if we'll end up in Dublin again."
5300081,426559043,3/21/2019,"Perfect location that is walking distance from the waterfront, restaurants, and shopping."
5300081,436048992,4/12/2019,Great location and a lovely host give this Malahide airbnb top ratings!
5300081,442376862,4/23/2019,"Clean, cozy and relaxing. Rosheen is a terrific host. Great location î close to the airport, close to the train station (half-hour to Dublin). Malahide is a beautiful village with nice pubs and a castle."
5300081,444142961,4/27/2019,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay here, and would highly recommend. Rosheen is very accommodating, and kind!"

5300081,449357613,5/6/2019,"Rosheen's place is neat and private, despite being in her family's home. We had all that we needed and Rosheen and her husband were available for local info and anything else that we could want. Perfect location within Malahide!"
5300081,450007235,5/8/2019,"Great location, friendly family, excellent value."

5300081,454505443,5/18/2019,"Rosheen's  place is quiet, yet just is a short walk to the charming town center of Malahide, with post office, food store, and many restaurants and pubs.  The castle is  just a short drive away, or a 20 minute walk, and the airport is conveniently near.  Rosheen is a charming host,  super clean, and so helpful with advice.  Would definitely stay there again."
5300081,461207271,5/31/2019,Rosheen was a great host. Had everything I needed and was a very enjoyable stay!
5300081,465166398,6/7/2019,Rosheen was very pleasant from the get go. Fast responses and very accommodating.
5300081,468013210,6/11/2019,"Rosheen is an amazing host! The house has a very nice atmosphere. The colours on the walls and the posters create a positive and calm feeling.  Rosheen gave us private access to the bathroom, which is a plus! The breakfast included nice fruits! We liked the area even more than Dublin and we went on great excursions with Rosheen's tips. Make sure you buy the LEAP card instead of the Dublin bus card to be able to use the trains."
5300081,473163630,6/21/2019,Very welcoming host and very well located
5300081,474733971,6/23/2019,"In the heart of Malahide, great location."
5300081,481664869,7/5/2019,"Rosheen's place offers excellent value for Dublin which has become very expensive. Malahide is a great little place and a convenient 20 minute trip on the dart into central Dublin. The room is small, but comfortable and comes with a spotless private bathroom where she provides soap, shampoo,  and shower gel.  Rosheen is a lovely host; friendly, helpful and she also provides breakfast in the morning.  I would definitely recommend staying with her."
5300081,485168477,7/10/2019,"Rosheen and Michael were great hosts, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with them in Malahide. Michael picked us up from the Dublin Airport at a late hour (our plane arrived ~10:30 pm), which we greatly appreciated, and the room we stayed in was as described and suited us well. The bus stop and train station were within easy walking distance of the place, and Rosheen gave us great tips on potential places to visit. We highly recommend Rosheen's place!"
5300081,486910289,7/13/2019,"Rosheens place is great for a stay when you visit Dublin. We stayed for three nights, three persons. She and her family are very nice and friendly people, taking care of their guests. Sleeping room and bath room both very very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was also great, she even prepared breakfast for us for our quite early leave, thank you again for that. Based on this experience we can recommend Rosheens place and would stay there again!
Public transportation is also very good:
You can reach the airport with a direct bus (102) in about 40 minutes, very convenient.
Dublin city center can be reached by direct train in about 40 minutes. Bus 42 is also going into that direction, takes maybe a little longer, did not use, but good to know.
Both bus and train station are about 5 minutes walk from Rosheens place, and during that walk you pass several (super)markets and restaurants, so very good place to stay.
As written before, we would highly recommend Rosheens place!"
5300081,490803948,7/19/2019,Very good place. Rosheen is very nice person.
5300081,492207864,7/21/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rosheen's place. Her husband Michael picked us up from the airport, even though it was quite late. Everything was super clean. Rosheen offered a nice breakfast in the morning and left us the living room to take it. She is a really nice and hospitable person and I can highly recommend staying at her place."
5300081,494455153,7/24/2019,Unbelievable location. Rosheen is just lovely and the room was spotless. Very comfy bed
5300081,495568885,7/26/2019,"We were hosted by Rosheen just 2 days, however, during those days I found Rosheen as a very nice and helpful person as she adviced us places to visit in Dublin and in Malahide (including good pubs). She also printed me out a boarding pass and also she helped us with baking our meal because we could not use the kitchen. I can really recommend staying with Rosheen."
5300081,499394000,7/31/2019,"Very clean and tidy place, quiet and cosy. Rosheen is a very attentive host. We had a wonderful time there."
5300081,502866612,8/5/2019,I cant say enough wonderful things about Rosheens.  So extremely helpful with service to airport and buses.  I will stay here everytime I come to Dublin if it is available.   Malahide was a greatplace and she is right next to train and buses.  Thanks so much Rosheen Michaelfor such a lovely time.
5300081,506092699,8/10/2019,"Shes really sweet and answered all our questions on how to get to places and recommendations and responded to messages really fast. Provided a good breakfast with fruit, bagel, yogurt, tea, coffee etc. which was really nice."
5300081,510679038,8/16/2019,Kind folks very near to all that Malahide has to offer!
5300081,515077134,8/22/2019,"Rosheen's home was lovely, inviting and very clean.  The room was as pictured, with one twin and one double bed  - both very comfortable.  The light breakfast, tea and coffee was just right to get our day off to a perfect start.  We had our own private room and bath, but had to be a bit careful out of the bath, as it was on the second floor and the stairs were used by the family to get up to their living space on the floor above and the 4 children used the play room off the bathroom in the evening hours."
5300081,523364621,9/3/2019,Near to public transport. Its tidy and clean! Breakfast was lovely. Rosheen is friendly and helpful too. Satisfied.
5300081,524129217,9/5/2019,The location was close to Malahide village shops and restaurants. Rosheen was very helpful and provided us with a great breakfast.
5300081,528041937,9/12/2019,"The location of Rosheen's townhouse was so convenient that we were able to reach the DART station as well as a couple of good restaurants in a few minutes on foot. Although the bedroom was small as the photo shows, we were  given an exclusive access to a full bath as well as a kind of a living room on the same floor as our bedroom. Since the townhouse was one of more than 100 units in the neighborhood, we had expected some noises at night. However, we were very much impressed by the quietness during the night and we got good sleep over those three nights."
5300081,532684351,9/20/2019,Great location close to the train station (~5 minute walk) and a ~30 minute train ride into Dublin.  Parking provided with a permit.
5300081,535871862,9/25/2019,"What a wonderful overall experience, from being picked up at the airport to clean comfortable accommodations with a great breakfast in the morning. I would definitely stay here again."

5300081,546171854,10/13/2019,Great place to stay. Rosheen and her family are a fantastic host. I definitely recommend her for any future guests.
5300081,547908180,10/16/2019,"Perfect place,  Rosheen hospitality is excellent. My stay was pleasant. I always recommend."
5300081,552354319,10/21/2019,The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5300081,553133561,10/23/2019,Great location in Malahide. Easy 5 min walk into the town. Can take the train into Dublin from the station in Malahide. It is only a 5-10 min walk from the house. Stayed one night as we were flying out the next day. Only a 15 min drive to the airport. Room was very clean and comfortable. Bathroom is right beside the bedroom. Breakfast was served in the sitting room on the same floor.
5300081,554476253,10/26/2019,"She came to pick us up at the airport even though it was midnight.
It was all perfect. Rosheen has been helpful and kind with us.
I absolutely reccomend Rosheen as a host."
5300081,556788752,10/30/2019,"I had a wonderful stay in Malahide at Rosheens home. She went above & beyond as an amazing hostess to be helpful & accommodating to my needs. She was always thoughtful & kind. Her home is within walking distance from the bus for the airport & train to Dublin. You can also walk to Malahide castle & the great local pubs, shopping & marina. Its a beautiful place. Rosheen has very detailed information & ideas for things to do & see in Ireland. It was extremely helpful in guiding me in my adventures. Im thankful to her & her lovely family for making my trip even better than I could have imagined!"
5300081,557531976,11/1/2019,"Rosheen's husband picked us up from Dublin airport, only 15-20min from their home. Rosheen was very welcoming and gave us a tour of the space upon arrival. They provided a great breakfast and so many blankets! 
The train is only a 10min walk from the home and there are several bars and restaurants within a 5min walk. We had a great time."
5314113,504905881,8/8/2019,"What a lovely home in a fantastic location.  Ideal for families or adults who want to enjoy a tranquil urban stay. Rercy is a terrific Airbnb host. So many thoughtful touches for weary travelers...tea, coffee, wine and chocolates to name a few. She provided us with a detailed guide of the neighborhood that was so useful throughout our trip.  Such a great experience!"
5314113,507213917,8/11/2019,Great house with a lot of charm. Specious dining room. We enjoyed it a lot.

5332689,422580349,3/11/2019,"My family and I had a peaceful and enjoyable extended weekend at Garys place. The living space and two bedrooms were perfect for four adults, having an en-suite and large bathroom was ideal. The underfloor heating kept the apartment nice and warm. This is a quiet area about 2-3 miles from the city centre. We got taxis into the city as there were four of us, cost to the city ranged from ‚Ç¨13-‚Ç¨16. I would advise using the local taxi app. Parking right outside the door is a real bonus in Dublin.  Would definitely book again."
5332689,431605295,4/1/2019,Gary is very responsive and communicates really well. His place is very stylish at the end of a quiet ally yet its very convenient to shops and restaurants and its an easy walk everywhere.
5332689,437901374,4/15/2019,"This is a very classy place, and you get the feeling that you'd enjoy a conversation with whoever has been living here.  We never met Gary, but he responded to our questions very quickly."
5332689,443998873,4/27/2019,"Garys home is very cosy and comfortable in a great village 10 mins from the centre.  It is close to nearby restaurants, bars and Herbert Park.  I stayed with my family between our house move and Gary was very helpful with checkin and accommodating our dog.  His garden is quiet serene and a beautiful calm space especially for a yoga teacher.  I would gladly recommend this place for any traveller."
5332689,456759232,5/22/2019,"Absolutely lovely apartment. Beautifully decorated, everything has been thought of, beautiful finishing touches. Great bathrooms. Lovely leafy green patio with a bbq. I could happily live here!"

5332689,492313772,7/21/2019,"Nice house! With everything you can need, at home, in the kitchen, even juice and milk for breakfast! I recommend it.

5332689,542421692,10/6/2019,"Garys place was exceptionally clean, in a great location that was not on the main road, but close enough to walk to activities.  And only a 15 min taxi ride into the heart of the city.   The apartment was beautiful and well kept. And Gary was very easy to reach, and very communicative with access and tips for venturing out!

An absolute pleasure to stay here, and we look forward to coming back!  Highly recommended!"
5332689,544148752,10/9/2019,"Gary is a very responsive host and takes care of all the details. Traveling for work we needed a space with two beds and two bathrooms. This place fit the bill and was also a cozy place, with a nice garden, full kitchen amenities, and a stylish space.  Fresh flowers and some basics in the fridge never go amiss. There are a number of cozy pubs, excellent eateries of different cuisines, and access to bus, air coach, and the tram system. Would definitely return."
5332689,546229760,10/13/2019,"Garys apartment is OUTSTANDING! It is spacious, wonderfully decorated and convenient to the downtown Dublin area. The rooms, especially the master, are spacious and comfortable. Gary was a communicative, thoughtful and kind host, which we were greatly appreciative of. The living space is open and the kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. The back patio space was also lovely and peaceful. Theres a dedicated parking space in front of the unit. We will stay here again on our next visit to Dublin!"
5332689,550734369,10/19/2019,Wonderful place to stay! Gary was a great host and his place was just perfect for our stay.
5332689,555211054,10/27/2019,"Gary's flat is a really lovely place in a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown Dublin. It made for a very comfortable introduction to the city for my in-laws who had not been out of the US in roughly 20 years and were not quite sure what to expect. Floors are heated, everything was clean and modern, decor was stylish yet comfortable with a great outdoor patio space. Each couple had their own bedroom and bathroom. Check-in instructions were very clear and Gary was super responsive when we had questions prior to arriving. The flat is a 10 to 15 minute cab ride in to various parts of downtown Dublin. For the price, it was a great value for lodging in an otherwise very expensive city."
5332689,558898972,11/3/2019,"Gary's Place was amazing. Gary is a real awesome guy. He went out of his way to accommodate us. The apartment is brilliant, very stylishly decorated and super clean. Anyone that chooses this Airbnb will be greeted with great hospitality and will enjoy every minute in this awesome accommodation and company. The location is great, close to great pubs and restaurants in the village. Thank you for your home Gary."
5337567,422575599,3/11/2019,"We enjoy our visit in Dublin, the flat is really very well located in a secured and safe residence.
The neighbourhood is very quite. The apartments equipment was perfect.

5337567,431029835,3/31/2019,"The apartment is just as pictured - we were a family of 5 and we were there for 10 days visiting our daughter who is studying at Trinity. The space was very nice, with thoughtful, interesting touches throughout! The outside patio added a great extra place to sit and chat. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen amenities were really a nice treat.  I injured my foot while traveling , and so the location required me to use MYTAXI more than I had planned, but the city is walkable and there are a few very nice bars less than a block away!  Great hosts had a very helpful instruction book awaiting our arrival ( and they were so terrific about our check-in time- as our flight landed at 5:30 am!) All in all - a terrific stay!"
5337567,433960580,4/7/2019,The Penthouse was a perfect quiet oasis away from downtown but close enough to walk. We loved our stay and highly recommend the Penthouse for future guests!
5337567,435768229,4/11/2019,"I have stayed in dozens of AirBnbs across 10+ countries and Stephen and Adam's place is the BEST AirBnb I have ever stayed in: magical on the inside, great location, incredible hospitality. It is one of the only times I've been in a city and decided to go back to my apartment rather than explore because I wanted to spend more time in the AirBnb. 

Truly amazing - I recommend going to Ireland just to stay in this apartment."

5337567,451167136,5/11/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay! Check in and check out was seamless, and the place was full of character and very clean. The host was thoughtful in making up the pull out couch to accommodate the number of guests and any providing snacks. Would highly recommend!"
5337567,453959794,5/17/2019,"Beautiful Apartment that was more than we expected.  Close, but not too close to the city center.  Walking distance to main attractions yet far enough off the beaten path to enjoy the non tourist side of Dublin.  balcony was a huge plus!  Thanks for helping make our trip that much more memorable!"
5337567,458681572,5/26/2019,"Fantastic!

The apartment was great, and very well located. Also thank the treatment of the renters as they were attentive to us at all times."
5337567,461859613,6/1/2019,Great apartment in a great location.
5337567,463972682,6/4/2019,"Stephen & Adam's space was perfect for what we needed for a quick family stop over in Dublin.  Beds were comfortable and the space had everything we needed.  The hosts were quick to connect with me as soon as the reservation was made and leading up to our arrival and provided all of the information that we needed. 

Upon arrival, we were met by one of those hosts who helped us get settled and answered any questions that we may have had. The hosts were nice enough to provide coffee, tea and a few basic food items to get us started, along with a book that noted the apartment and surrounding area details,  very hospitable!

The location is about a 20 minute ride to the airport, 20 minute walk from Temple Bar area, and 30 minute walk from some of the ""major"" tourist attractions, but the immediate surrounding area has plenty of options for quick dining, pubs and grocery needs.  It's also conveniently located about a 3 minute walk to the Connolly stop for the Luas, if that's how you choose to get around the city.  

Would definitely recommend or stay at this location again. Thank you!"
5337567,465673341,6/8/2019,Fantastic. Highly recommend. It's close enough to everything to be convenient but far enough away so you get peace and quiet at night. Duncan and Marina were super hospitable and went above and beyond to accommodate us.
5337567,467359836,6/10/2019,"What a fantastic home! My family of five (ages 13-50) loved how clean, neat, well cared for this home was. Very comfortable too."
5337567,468766768,6/13/2019,"Amazing, attentive hosts, great location. We were spoiled by such an amazing property. Marianna was in regular touch to ensure we were ok... great experience"
5337567,472279036,6/19/2019,"Absolutely wonderful! Thank you so much for your hospitality, we felt very taken care of. The view was positively phenomenal, even better than we were expecting! Would absolutely recommend to anyone and everyone."
5337567,475973831,6/25/2019,"This place was great, it was located near everything we wanted.  If you want none stop parties try the Temple Bar, if you want a place that is near pubs, restaurants, the train and bus station, etc.  Will come back again if we can return to Ireland."
5337567,485232901,7/10/2019,Great communications. Super accommodating to jet-lagged travelers!  Fantastic location close to sights/restaurants/bars.
5337567,486799989,7/13/2019,"We had a beautiful stay in the apartment, it was absolutely perfect for our needs and was within (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) mins walk of everything. To be honest I can't find any fault about the place, there were supplies of Bread, butter, milk, ham , coffee, tea etc all there for us when we arrived too. We will definitely be staying here again (if we can get an available date). Duncan, Adam and Marina were so easy to deal with and responded via (Hidden by Airbnb) within minutes of texting. A really great place to stay"
5337567,489810620,7/17/2019,"Cute, stylish apartment north of the Liffey. Had all the amenities we needed, and the extra space was greatly appreciated. Check in was flexible and a breeze, and our hosts were very attentive. When the apartment got a bit hot and stuffy, they even offered to bring us a fan. All the small touches like coffee, starter kit of groceries, laundry supplies etc were very much appreciated. Definitely worth staying and worthy of the super host designation! Thanks Alex and Duncan!"
5337567,493927019,7/23/2019,Good location and space. Cleanliness and amenities were disappointing. Poor value for money.
5337567,494950967,7/25/2019,"Great and beautiful space, incredible location and amazing hospitality. Adam and Marina are amazing hosts"
5337567,497184025,7/28/2019,"Adam's place is very stylishly and interestingly decorated and designed.  The location --just north of the river by the EPIC Emigration Museum and public transportation -- is excellent.  It is also a quick walk to the south side of the river, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, and the Temple Bar area.  The view is great and the beds are comfortable.  There are several stores within a short walk so it is easy to get what you need."
5337567,499448026,7/31/2019,Excellent communication and great location. Youll definitely get fresh air from this penthouse spot!
5337567,501313682,8/3/2019,"The place is excellently located in the heart of Dublin, but not too close to loud streets. The building itself is very interesting surrounded by canal. We enjoyed the luminous and large place with great taste. The host was very helpful to the every question we made - Duncan helped us a lot and even followed up whether it had gone well :) The stay will promise your stay very special and feel local in Dublin at the same time."
5337567,503717597,8/6/2019,Apartment was accurate to listing - a great place in a great location.  Host was quick with responses to questions and provided some nice recommendations.  Would highly recommend.
5337567,505537806,8/9/2019,The apartment is really phenomenal. The location was fantastic and easily within walking distance of all the prime sites of Dublin. There was absolutely no need to entertain public transport or Ubers or anything like that. It was a very stylish apartment with a lot of thoughtful nuances and creature comforts.  All of our questions were answered very quickly over the app and the check in process was super easy.  I Would absolutely stay at this apartment again when I visit Dublin in the future. Fantastic place!
5337567,519752847,8/29/2019,"Great location, with easy access to both red and green line trams.   Very responsive host. Great space to relax after a full day of sightseeing. Very safe."
5337567,523276021,9/3/2019,Great place in a safe neighbourhood. The apartment is a short walk to pretty much anything.
5337567,525789892,9/8/2019,"What a great experience.  The location in the center of town could not be beat.  We were able to walk every place we wanted to see, including the popular attractions of Christ Church, St. Patricks Cathedral and Guiness.  Check in and check out were easy, and it was great to be greeted on arrival.  Hosts were very attentive well before and during our stay.
We would definately stay here again."

5337567,534120085,9/22/2019,"This place was great. You can walk pretty much anywhere, and for places you can't, it's very easy to get a taxi (the meeting spot it right outside the gate). The host was great at communicating and being available no matter what time we wanted to check-in. If I visited Dublin again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here."
5337567,555911637,10/28/2019,The hosts were brilliant in every way very helpful!
5337567,556792543,10/30/2019,"Great place, would stay again."

The guys were great hosts and communication was good. 
Thank you"
5370743,422020723,3/10/2019,A lovely house with plenty of space. A short bus journey or taxi ride into city centre.
5370743,444069454,4/27/2019,"The house is reasonably spacious. With 3 bedrooms, it worked out great for our family of 4. Wifi worked as expected. The place and the neighborhood seems safe. Our host suggested that we could park our rental car on the road, and that worked out ok for us as well. But public transportation is close by. DART is just 5-6 min walk. All in all, seems like a good place to stay for a visit to Dublin."
5370743,450058051,5/8/2019,This is one of the best homes we have stayed in. Extremely neat and clean and you have everything you need in a home away from home. The location was just perfect and only 15min from Dublin City by taxi. Shops and restaurants are also close by. Best of all is the quiet area it is located in. Denise is a wonderful host and was extremely accommodating with the check-in and check-out times. Thanks for everything Denise and see you soon ;-)
5370743,459981624,5/28/2019,Denise's place was awesome.  Nice touch with breakfast supplies for our first morning as we arrived late in the evening.  Quick communication and everything provided as stated in listing.
5370743,463855932,6/4/2019,This was by far one of the best experiences with an airbnb our family has had! Denise was quick to communicate through out the whole experience. She was accomodating when it came to our check in and even had a wonderful selection of snacks and breakfast items which was greatly appreciated. The location was perfect as it was easy to get to the train and bus stop. We purchased a bus pass from the Spar shop less than 10 minutes away and used each day for our trips into Dublin. So many great places locally in town that were so easy to walk to as well!! Denise is definitely a super host!!
5370743,467226461,6/10/2019,Denise was great! Was in constant communication and very accommodating. Really nice 3 bedroom spot with one room having a private bathroom! Very awesome place and like a 4 minute walk to the bus stop to go into town.
5370743,472693479,6/20/2019,"This is a perfect place to stay, the proximity to downtown Dublin can't be beat. Clontarf is a peaceful place to relax after a busy day in Dublin. The DART is about 12 minutes walk from the house but even better is the Bus #130 that picks up and drops off right on the main road about 2 minutes walk from the house. The local restaurants along the bay front were great. Fish and chips/burgers at the La Casa takeaway and pasta next door were a hit. Denise was great and very helpful, we hope to return soon."
5370743,479646673,7/1/2019,"Lovely house,  was well equipped.  Denise was lovely and helpful.  Overall had a great stay."
5370743,488687288,7/15/2019,"Denise has been an excellent host. The place was great and the location was geographically perfectly balanced. It was just at one stop away from the city center by DART, but in a safe and calm neighborhood. If you are travelling with kids it is also quite close from the Fairview Park and playground. If we ever return to Dublin we will contact the host again for sure."
5385256,431007347,3/31/2019,My weekend in Dublin was perfect! Bb is one of the kindest people I've ever met. The check in process was easy and I felt safe and comfortable in the apartment. Barbara is also very easy to talk to and has great tips on traveling to the surrounding areas! Will definitely be making a trip back to visit!
5385256,437905793,4/15/2019,"Barbaras apartment is in a good location, with central Dublin within reasonable walking distance, otherwise reachable by bus. Theres a Starbucks just two minutes down the street, good option for breakfast. The room can feel a little cramped, but youll be fine for a few days. The bathroom doesnt have much space to place your toiletries. Bathroom/kitchen is shared, but I never had to wait for anyone, so that was no issue at all. Barbara was super flexible regarding check-in time, very friendly and smiling, and offered plenty of tips for things to see and do around Dublin."
5385256,444086916,4/27/2019,All as described. Barbara is very sweet and nice host.

5408600,427851640,3/24/2019,This space was amazing! Esther's husband gave us tips of where to go and even offered to sit down with a map for other areas of our trip. The space is perfect and only a mile from city center. You have to try out this place!

The studio itself was bright and clean with an extremely comfy bed! We throughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend to others looking for a weekend in Dublin."

5408600,449230924,5/6/2019,"Esthers apartment is in a good location for exploring the city, a short walk into Rathmines which has some good restaurants and cafes and a short 30 minute walk/10 min bus into the centre of Dublin. Comfortable stay for a reasonable price! Thank you"
5408600,451894521,5/12/2019,"Loved the location of this cute apartment. Although small, it provided everything that my Husband and I needed for our stay. I would recommend this studio to anyone looking for a comfortable and cozy place in Rathmines!"
5408600,453278437,5/15/2019,Esther its exactly as the photos. Its a plus the backyard. Its a one bus from the city center. We definitely recommend this place.
5408600,454421817,5/18/2019,We really enjoyed our stay. Esthers place was very beautiful even if there was no kitchen we didn't miss anything. As a guest you can also use the garden with was really nice to have breakfast or a calm night. She was really welcoming and we also had a nice chat with her son. It's not directly situated in the city but with puplic transport you get there easily. It's a good choice to stay there. We would definitely come back.

5408600,472252830,6/19/2019,Esthers B&B was very clean and neat.  The bus to downtown was easily accessible.  and there are a few pubs and restaurants and grocers at the end of the block. (10 minutes away)

5408600,488628588,7/15/2019,"Esthers place is wonderfully located in Rathmines, with an easy walk to the restaurants, pubs and shops on Rathmines road, and equally easy access to public transportation. I walked everywhere from here, to the EatYard, Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, Temple Bar etc., some of those places are a bit of a trek, but walking was my choice.  The hosts are lovely, and I enjoyed the tranquility of the garden."
5408600,494436868,7/24/2019,"Esterùs place Is wonderful! Small, perfect for 2. It is super easy to get to the bus from her apt! I would highly recommend it! When I go back to Ireland I hope to stay with her again."

5408600,556711553,10/30/2019,"Esther and and Ed are quite the wonderful couple. They are both quit communicative and offer quite sensible and needed advice for the unlearned traveler as we were. Even their son Rory was helpful as a welcome kid conversationalist. Kids keep you young, too! You cant ask more than a clean functioning room. Walking to the shopping and sights of downtown is so doable and can be a fascinating event to boot. Great food downtown (Brannigans Pub had a delicious salmon dinner). All in all a memorable first visit to Dublin!"
5408600,559530142,11/4/2019,"Great value for money in the city centre of Dublin you arent going to find anything cheaper thats anywhere near as nice. Nice space, the little kitchen space was a nice touch. Only small flaw was it was difficult to get nice hot water through the taps. Other than that really good space for the price your paying."
5408600,561998897,11/10/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay in Esther's guest suite. The place is very clean, and she provided amenities which made our stay even more comfortable. Though she was away on holiday, Esther kept in constant communication with us, making sure things were going smoothly. The house itself is situated in a convenient location, just a few minutes walk away from a shopping center, bus stop, Tesco, and several places to eat. Would absolutely recommend as a base from which to explore Dublin (and Rathmines!)."
5408614,423469533,3/14/2019,"Smaller than it looks in the photos, but a great rate in a great part of Dublin."

5408614,458760430,5/26/2019,"We had a lovely stay - we were made to feel very welcome and Ed was particularly helpful in making sure we had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable.  In terms of location we couldnt have picked a better spot.  Local pubs and amenities are a stones throw away - there are cafes - pubs - restautants everyhthing you could wish for walking distance.  Getting into dublin city centre was also a breeze - about 20-25 mins walk or there is a regular bus service too.  The house and room were both very impressive a large georgian town house perfect for a city break stay.  Couldnt fault anything really - if we were to be really picky maybe a bin area outside so residents can easily dispose of rubbish or recycling other than that a perfect place to stay.  Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for comfy elegant roomy accommodation with an absolute perfect location.  Thankyou, jag and collette"
5408614,464733008,6/6/2019,"Nice apartment in a really nice area. We dont met Esther in person, but communication to get into the apartment was well described. We enjoyed our stay."

5408614,497118794,7/28/2019,"Excellent location and a nice bright studio, with a very comfy bed. The shower was slow to drain so we had to be careful not to flood the bathroom - it was a shame this wasn't fixed during our stay."
5408614,508137656,8/12/2019,"Comfortable, cozy, kind host, fast responsive on texts."
5408614,511232522,8/17/2019,"Esther and her family were very hospitable. We stayed in her studio, which was small, but just what we needed. Esther is a great host and  besides the normal amenities, even equipped the studio with a refrigerator, water kettle, and tea! The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by a bunch of great restaurants and a short bus ride or nice 30 min walk up to the city center. Thanks for a great place to stay in Dublin! I would definitely recommend staying with Esther and her family :)"
5408614,523326050,9/3/2019,Very quiet and clean place. We didn't see the host for 5 days
5408614,525731513,9/8/2019,"This is the perfect location for exploring Dublin, especially if you can handle a 30 minute walk. Its a stylish area and there are greats bars and restaurants just down the road. A no frills accommodation, which is exactly right for the price."
5408614,530090001,9/15/2019,Thank you for the wonderful stay at your place. It was so charming and we loved staying in the studio apartment. We had everything we needed and more. We would love to come back here one day.

I enoyed my stay & would definitely recommend to other guests."
5408614,538944558,9/30/2019,"This studio fit us very well for our three nights in Dublin. The check in process was extremely easy, and after a long day of travel this meant a lot. The bed was comfortable and room was perfect size for my boyfriend and I. But my favorite part of this studio was the location. Had I not stayed here I likely wouldn't have ventured into Rathmines, which has gorgeous streets lined with brick houses and delicious food only a block away. It's also about a 20 minute walk into central Dublin. I would reccomend booking this studio!"
5408614,553098859,10/23/2019,A great space that is a convenient distance from the airport and Dublin centre. Highly recommend renting a car and driving out into Wicklow mountains/national park for beautiful scenery.
5408614,559618412,11/4/2019,"The accommodation is good, the room is big enough for 2 persons and is really private. The renters also reply quickly and are very hospitable. The location is good if you want to relax, but if you want to go to the city center it is pretty far away. Walking 35 minutes, the bus 20 minutes.  In general, it is a good room and nice hosts :)"
5422346,423878430,3/15/2019,My stay at Lee's place was excellent!!!  Check in was easy and Lee went above and beyond my expectations to make my stay comfortable.  Lee's place is centrally located and allows easy access to buses and local sights.  I would highly recommend it for female solo travelers.
5422346,425924031,3/19/2019,"The location of Lees place is in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to everything including Temple Bar. Room was private and clean, comfy bed and Lee was always available. Highly recommend for your Dublin stay."
5422346,434732893,4/8/2019,"Due to arrival and departure timing, I didn't meet Lee, but her flatmate Monica was grand! Clear explanations on the layout and how to work different lights and electric shower. The bed/bedding was comfy, a little balcony off the bedroom is great to sit and relax while hearing the Christ Church Cathedral bells, space in a wardrobe to hang and store items. There are several maps and reference materials, and Monica pointed out some areas I might be interested in exploring (I was and I did!) And she would ask when I was planning on walking between areas and let me know when a taxi was advisable (whether due to distance or safety). I would definitely stay here again. The location can't be topped, and the hosts and space are so welcoming!"
5432534,422013893,3/10/2019,"Matching the description. 
Only inconvenient element : you have to turn the water boiler on 20 minutes before you plan to have a shower. Beside that all good, I recommend to stay and well located in the city"

Took me a bit to get used to the water heater but it wasnt a problem. Nothing fancy but its a nice little studio apartment for a solo traveler."
5432851,447299581,5/3/2019,"A cosy, little flat in a great location next to public transport and local shops, cafes, and pubs. Bernards communication was excellent and fast."
5432851,449670993,5/7/2019,Very clean and convenient room. The neighborhood is very nice and you can easily access public transports or other commodities
5432851,453555062,5/16/2019,"Basic clean studio flat. 
A good base for seeing Dublin"
5432851,456698260,5/22/2019,"Comfortable, very clean, extremely handy for city centre (and in the heart of a very buzzy / lively part of town) and host very friendly and helpful."
5432851,458504320,5/26/2019,Great value! Very easy access to public transportation. Very comfortable!

5432851,474685266,6/23/2019,"Very nice little place, nothing fancy if you're willing to take the bus into the city centre. Great cost for the little studio"
5432851,490950066,7/19/2019,Great studio space in an excellent location. Easy to commute around Dublin from and great places to dine and drink around the area.

5432851,526046679,9/8/2019,"Super tolle Lage; kleine Wohnung, in der alles vorhanden ist, was man braucht."
5432851,530092342,9/15/2019,"This spot is perfect for a solo traveler who isnt expecting a luxurious hotel room. It is quaint and cozy. I found the location to be marvelous. Not too close not too far from the Temple Bar area. Its exactly a thirty minute walk to get to that area. But theres so many shops and pubs on the way that it feels like less. While there, I only used a taxi once (after a long day tour I was too tired to walk). 

There are about three groceries stores within walking distance, for those travelers who like to prepare their own food. Restaurants and pubs are plentiful around this air bnb. 

You can hear your neighbors, but thats expected. This airbnb also offers a garden (with a grill!)  to wind down and relax. All amenities worked as described - heater, water heater, and WiFi. 

All in all, Im very satisfied with my stay at Bernards AIRBNB."
5432851,535866267,9/25/2019,"Great choice for solo travelers, it quite roomy for a one room place. You get a bed, small table and small kitchen. The location is great, just a short bus ride (or 30 min walk) into the center. About 4 different grocery stores a few minutes away. Bernard has over 10 apartments in the building that he rents out. Everyone shares the backyard and the laundry room. Everyone's key opens the front door and their own door. 
This place is up one flights of steps and faces the backyard.
There is some noise from other guests, but not from the street.
The place was pretty clean except for some mold around the ridge of the shower.
Communication was ok, when I arrived at 2 I did have to wait in the garden for 10 minutes while  Bernard finished cleaning room...
In sum it is a good choice for a solo traveler, you get exactly what is described."
5432851,536792083,9/27/2019,"This studio is great!  It's in a central location in Rathmines which is a thriving neighbourhood that is easily walkable to the city centre. There are plenty of good restaurants, cafes and amenities in this area. The studio is in a quiet building and is equipped with a comfy bed, small fridge, kitchen to cook if you'd like and a clean bathroom with towels, shampoo and body wash. It was a very comfortable stay as I slept well and would stay here again if I could!"
5432851,538874828,9/30/2019,"The studio is basic but has everything needed for a short visit.  The studio faces the garden which was nice. The location is great, with bars and shops nearby, and within walking distance to Dublin city centre."

It was about a 25 minute walk to temple bar but the street its located on had a bunch of great places to grab food as well.  Bernard supplies everyone with a little list of good shops, places to grab food and everything else you could desire."
5432925,425864792,3/19/2019,"Super friendly host, quick response and very nice! Recommend!!"

5432925,431024403,3/31/2019,Bernard was an excellent host. The room was perfect for a single traveler. I will be returning on my next trip.
5432925,437800121,4/15/2019,"Bernards place is right at the hub of a lot of necessities including diners, transport, shops, grocers, etc. Love the privacy of the place and the amenities for a solo traveler. All I needed were just a stone throw away!"
5432925,447925593,5/4/2019,"Host was great to work with. The room came with tea and coffee, hairdryer, cutlery and crockery. Location is great."
5432925,455170762,5/19/2019,Very good place. Highly recommended

5432925,467905431,6/11/2019,"The room is very cozy with everything you need, ideal for a solo traveler. The location is good with various bus routes, easily accessible to other parts of the city and can also have a stroll to the centre. Bernard is a wonderful host, friendly, quick response yet respect guests privacy. I arrived around 9:00 am in the morning, Bernard arranged early check-in for me. Its my first Airbnb experience, which is far more better than I expected."
5432925,471332019,6/17/2019,"Bernard was a great host who was very helpful with getting me to and from the accommodation. Very polite and had no issue with me being slightly late due to public transport being slow/delayed. The room was great and very clean, although I did not use very many of the amenities I am certain they are up to a similar standard as the parts that I did use. The information sheet provided about the area is very helpful even if slightly dated. It is great that the information sheet doesnt just cover the big tourist attractions that everyone already knows about but instead local shops and pubs in the area. All-in-all, amazing experience at this location. Would definitely return if I were to come back to Dublin!"
5432925,473846627,6/22/2019,"Bernards place is exactly as described! There are bus stops right outside so it is incredibly easy to use public transport. It is a little outside the city center, maybe a mile, but it is a pleasant walk or super simple to catch the bus. Bernards tips were very helpful for both the area and how to successfully get around Dublin."
5432925,476459519,6/26/2019,"I had a pleasant stay. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The description of the room on Airbnb website perfectly matches with what I found. Bernard is a friendly and supportive host. The location is great as well, with many bars, restaurants and supermarkets and quite close to Temple Bar district (30 minutes walking). On the way to Temple bar there are nice bars and pubs as well. Highly recommended place."
5432925,481699038,7/5/2019,Thanks Bernard
5432925,484660683,7/9/2019,This is exactly what I was looking for during my recent trip to explore Dublin. The space had everything I needed and allowed me to make several small meals on my own so I didnt have to incur the expense of every meal out. Accommodations were comfortable and well appointed. Bernard was very helpful with my check in and helped with local tips. About a 10 minute walk from city center which was perfect. Would recommend.
5432925,505387103,8/9/2019,"I would totally recommend Bernard's place to stay,  a good value for money and amazing locality. Everything is just so close by and alot of things to do around Rathmines. Highly recommended"
5432925,517159246,8/25/2019,A great place for a solo traveler.  Located on multiple bus routes so easy to get in and out of the city center.  Would definitely recommend.

5432925,529788617,9/15/2019,Great place
5432925,533344028,9/21/2019,"Basic accomodation, location decent as Rathmines close to the city centre and on a major bus route. But the shower water pressure was not good and just a dribble. You could get around it by keeping the sink hot water tap on which seemed to improve the water flow, and you could also pour a 'shower' from the sink."

5432981,422581955,3/11/2019,"Bernards place was absolutely perfect. My friend and I stayed for a weekend, and it had all we needed. Rathmines is a really cool area, with some nice restaurants and a couple of nice pubs. Its so easy to get a bus or an Uber from the city but super quiet to sleep in the apartment. Very good value for Dublin!"
5432981,425926927,3/19/2019,"The place is small, BUT it has everything you need for a great stay in Dublin. The location was perfect with 3 grocery store options within feet from the flat, a bus stop across the street and a really unique pub down the street, Blackbird, that I would recommend. I was able to walk to pubs, restaurants, the city center and tourist attractions from the flat- I did not have to take public transportation once aside from travel to and from the airport. Bernard provided a comfortable place to stay with coffee/ tea, extra towels, and the basics you would need. The communication prior to my stay was excellent, as he was really accommodating with my early flight and let me check in early (thank you!). Overall I would recommend!"
5432981,442375352,4/23/2019,Really cozy place in a nice area. Would recommend.

5432981,458765935,5/26/2019,The apartment is very clean and has everything you need. We even cooked simple meals. Although in a lively and lovely neighborhood its very quiet in the apartment. The garden is a bonus! Beautiful!
5432981,471772125,6/18/2019,"Bernard was very helpful and friendly. He assisted us with all of our needs. Great location with many eatery's near by along with easy access to many of the bus lines.

5432981,522612165,9/2/2019,"Lovely place in a great location, located in Rathmines where there is plenty of entertainment and amenities, and a short bus trip, or walk to Dublin city."
5432981,527167229,9/10/2019,"Bernards space was perfect for my needs. It was super clean and comfortable, and he was very quick to respond and flexible with leaving bags prior to check in and after check out if I needed to. Some people may be concerned about its distance from city center and all the attractions, but it is really just a stones throw away via public transportation and much more peaceful at night while still offering all the amenities like restaurants, pubs, and groceries... I would certainly stay here again!"

5433024,448370480,5/5/2019,Our stay here was great. It was very clean and a perfect fit for two people. The location was good. There was a bus stop right across the street and also a lot of amenities in the neighborhood itself if you didnt want to go into downtown Dublin.

The apartment is lovely and there was plenty of room for the four of us. The only thing to note is that the water pressure in the shower isn't super strong, but other than that the place was perfect for our stay. Agnes was an excellent host and gave us tons of helpful recommendations for the area. She also met us early in the morning when we arrived so we could drop off our bags before the check-in time, which was very thoughtful of her."

Amanda was super welcoming and her pup, George, is a sweet, friendly little chap. The ensuite room was bright, sparkling clean and spacious enough for both myself and my (6 ft 2 rugby playing) boyf to not feel crowded. Amanda had great local knowledge (Legit Coffee across the road was a great shout) and the location of the flat was perfect for getting to/from town. We were also able to leave our bags at the flat for the day after check out, which we didn't expect and were very grateful for. In short, 10/10, 5 stars, would recommend 110%."
5442043,427865021,3/24/2019,Had a great stay in Amandas place. The location is good and the room has everything youll need. Amanda is such an lovely person and her dog George is aswell. :)
5442043,430817190,3/31/2019,"Amanda is the perfect host. The location is very good, only a 15min walk to the city centre."
5442043,432882402,4/5/2019,We are very happy that we chose Amanda's place! We stayed for 2 nights. The apartment is in a perfect location about 10 minutes from the city center. It was well equipped and spotlessly clean! We would definitely stay again next time in Dublin! And George is great too!!
5442043,434108281,4/7/2019,"Fully recommend staying at Amanda's place. Me and my girlfriend went to Dublin for a weekend and Amanda (and George as well) was a super nice host. Her place is clean, in a great location and Amanda was quick in communication and gave us nice local tips. We would definitely stay here again."
5442043,436061597,4/12/2019,"Amanda offers a clean and very comfy place in Dublin. Her apartment is just a few minutes walk to all the things to do/see; no car needed. There are a couple options for breakfast, lunch and dinner nearby, but it's not too far from the Temple Bar area and other locations if you fancy other restaurants than the ones nearby. Amanda helped us a lot with finding a place to park and giving us tips to get around the city. Check-in and out was very simple due to great communication. We would definitely go there again!"
5442043,437162341,4/14/2019,Amanda was a great host. The room had everything we needed for our short stay in Dublin. Amanda was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.
5442043,439097640,4/18/2019,Amanda is super nice! Very good location. Clean and cosy room. Thank you Amanda!
5442043,439582275,4/19/2019,Stayed at Amandas place overnight after a redeye flight. It was a very nice room with a very comfortable bed and a nice sized washroom. Amanda goes out of her way to meet the guests and her doggie George was adorable. Overall we really loved her hospitality. The location is a bit further from the attractions and not ideal to walk at night. There were not many close food establishments. A great place to stay if you dont mind a walk into the main area of attractions. Bus transportation  to and from the airport was very easy to navigate.
5442043,445898398,4/30/2019,"Amanda is a very kind and helpful host, making you feel welcome from the first helloù. She offered suggestions of what to do and gave directions to the many sights in Dublin. The bedroom is a bit of a tight space since she added a darling bookshelf (not seen in the pictures). It is a bit noisier at night than we expected but the location is just excellent. Its a short walk from many of the spectacular sights in Dublin and safe! I would recommend Violets home to anyone looking for location and absolutely adequate sleeping situation."
5442043,446395325,5/1/2019,Great place for a short stay in Dublin!
5442043,447335073,5/3/2019,"Amanda and George were really great hosts. We loved the little accessoires in the room (Oropax, desinfectant, etc)."

5442043,452913644,5/14/2019,"We had a great time at Amandas! She was an outstanding host, very friendly and welcoming. She was flexible with check-in since our flight arrival was within 1-6 PM and I really appreciated that. Cute little George was well behaved and so cute! Thanks Amanda, definitely recommend!"
5442043,453647153,5/16/2019,"Amanda is a really friendly host who answers quickly to messages. She also gives great tipps for sightseeing, restaurants and bars. The room is tidy, the bed comfortable and you can quickly get to the centre of Dublin either by foot or bus. Don't worry about the dog George, we never heard him once - but he would appreciate your snuggles.
Tl;dr: Great place, great host, even better dog."
5442043,454020694,5/17/2019,"Amandas place is great! It has a great location in the city. Georgie, her dog is about as welcoming as you get, just loves a good pet! The bathroom was clean and well stocked as was the coffee and tea. I would recommend to my friends."

5442043,465726029,6/8/2019,"This is a space with a great location close to lots of attractions in Dublin. We like to walk so it worked well for us, but it is also not far from public transit. The price is right for the amount of space, the amenities, and location in this city.  The affordability and location are the best features of this place."
5442043,468745361,6/13/2019,"Just slightly off the beaten path but only 4 blocks from James St., this room was clean and quiet. Amanda was accommodating and there was nothing lacking. A great experience."
5442043,469782116,6/15/2019,Nice little place close to the city center.

5442043,486946115,7/13/2019,"Amandas place is clean, comfortable, and secure; Amanda and her dog are super friendly. The location is in a real neighborhood, with good places to eat breakfast and reasonable distances to walk to Dublins main tourist attractions. We found both on-street and garage parking troublesome and would recommend not having a car with you in Dublin."
5442043,493938590,7/23/2019,"Our stay at Amandas was very great! The location is good and within 10 minutes your right in the centre. Legit Coffee for breakfast is just opposite the apartment and very delicious! Amanda and George are very kind and give you great tips!
We can definitely recommend it :)"
5442043,506041512,8/10/2019,Outstanding place to stay in every aspect! Great location that is 15 minutes walking to every attraction in Dublin. Walking distance to OConnel street and Temple Bar. The bedroom was lovely. The bed is super comfortable and had a bathroom that is attached to the room. Everything was super clean. Amanda was really welcoming and had everything we needed and more. Thanks again Amanda! Hopefully we can come back again at one point.
5442043,508829713,8/13/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Amandas apartment! She was kind and always helpful, very communicative and sweet. The apartment is located quite central, everything can be reached by foot. Little George was adorable."
5442043,511520319,8/17/2019,"Amandas apartment was perfect for two travelers. Private bedroom and bathroom, secure building, very clean and organized apartment. She provided an outlet converter (for US plugs), toiletries, towels, an armoire to hang clothes, coffee/tea. Plus she was very friendly and her dog was so cute! It was within walking distance of the main attractions, Temple Bar area, etc. A couple good coffee and breakfast places right on the same street as the apartment. We had a great stay, would highly recommend!"
5442043,516547451,8/24/2019,Tutto come descritto
5442043,518082603,8/26/2019,"In all fairness, it could not have been better. Amanda is such a nice and sweet host, she made us more than welcome from the first second. Bed was big and comfy and location was great. A big plus definitely is George, the dog though  Can highly recommend to stay here!"
5442043,520457736,8/30/2019,"Fantastic place to stay, great location, great company and the friendliest puppy. You will have a comfortable and relaxing time at this beautiful place."
5442043,521933557,9/1/2019,"Amandas place was perfect for our short trip to Dublin.  10 minutes walk from both the main Temple Bar area and the Guinness Storehouse, we thought it was great value for both location and services.   Id not booked an air bnb where you dont get the whole apartment to yourself but if they are all like Amandas Id do it again in a flash.  We spent most of our time out and about but we felt very comfortable to come and go as we pleased, and when we were there we felt extremely welcome, the en suite bathroom gave us an extra bit of privacy, and Amanda was a perfect host- complete with great recommendations and a few thoughtful finishing touches in the room.  Thank you Amanda (and George- the cutest fluffiest host ever!) for having us!"
5442043,523790389,9/4/2019,"Amanda is a wonderful host, she was kind and helpful. The room was really nice, especially the bed!"

5442043,535789665,9/25/2019,"Lovely place located a very quick walk into the main city centre and close to so many attractions - all within walking distance. Place was clean and check in/communication was great. There are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants close and even more a short walk away. Communication was great and Amanda (and George the dog) are very lovely. Safe area, some noise was heard from the pub below, but not too disruptive and sleep was still easy to come by! Great place! Thanks again Amanda :)"
5442043,543747025,10/8/2019,Great location. Amanda was really lovely and welcoming. Thank you for making out stay more enjoyable
5442043,545482540,10/12/2019,"Amanda and George were 5 stars, the room was super comfy and clean, well decorated and in a great location close to most of the main landmarks. I'm are very happy and we highly recommend it."

5442043,552340589,10/21/2019,"My friend and I stayed at Amanda's over the weekend. She is a very lovely person and she will help you with anything you need. George is a nice dog who's quiet and you won't even notice that he's around.
The room is lovely and it's convenient to have your own bathroom. Amanda prepared a little basket with a bunch of things guests may need which was very helpful since we forgot to take a converter with us. Amanda endeavours to please all the needs her guests may have - there's also a water boiler and tea in the room. We enjoyed our stay, the apartent is not in the Dublin center but just a 15 min walk away from all the pubs and touristy places.
The only thing which bothered us was that the bathroom could be a bit cleaner - there was a sponge hanging in the shower with black hair on it.
All in all we enjoyed our stay in Dublin with having Amanda + Goerge as our hosts."
5442043,553060911,10/23/2019,"Amada gave clear and easy directions to follow. The apartment is a bit older so its small and nothing extravagant but Amanda is really thought with setting out tiles and we had tea in the room! Even offered us slippers!! Her dog, George, is really well behaved."
5442043,556383703,10/29/2019,"Amanda and her dog George are wonderful, friendly hosts! The location of her apartment is a just a short walk away from all the hustle and bustle of downtown Dublin, which was perfect for us. Close enough to be convenient, and far enough away to not be massively loud. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
5442043,559617829,11/4/2019,Amanda was great and very friendly! And the room was clean and there was everything we needed! I highly recommend staying there.
5442043,562114409,11/10/2019,The experience with Amanda was impeccable! The room was very clean and she was very willing and friendly. The position of the apartment is close enough to the city center. We absolutely recommend it!
5457387,427913120,3/24/2019,"Monicas place was great to stay whilst my partner and I were exploring Dublin. Not too far out from town and definitely very nice, comfortable accomodation. Monica was friendly and we really appreciated her still accomodating us and staying up to check us in after our flight was delayed. Nice little touches such as ear plugs as the room was on the street but to be honest was not bothered by any noise even without the earplugs. Very nice place, would recommend."
5457387,431595701,4/1/2019,"Great experience in Dublin, with the location of this place and the hospitality making it that much better."
5457387,434028781,4/7/2019,"Monica is an amazing host with a very beautiful home in the Liberties.

Would highly recommend staying here had an amazing time."
5457387,436557471,4/13/2019,"Monica is a great host who makes you feel more than welcomed in her home. She is very thoughtful and caring about the guests in her home.

5457387,440197679,4/20/2019,"My wife and I had an amazing stay at Monica's. Lovely warm welcome, very easy going and a great location for exploring the city. Couldn't ask for better hosts and being able to chat to the calmest dog I've ever met was a bonus! I'll miss you Frodo. Thanks again Monica and Michelle."
5457387,442779886,4/24/2019,"The house is charming with beautiful modern interiors. It is well equipped with all the facilities. The host, Monica, is the most charming, warm and helpful woman who made our stay in Dublin a very memorable experience. Also, the house has a cute little dog to keep you happy all day long."
5457387,444669018,4/28/2019,"Monicas home is very well situated within Dublin, a short walk from St Patricks Cathedral, and near Temple Bar area. The bathroom is gorgeous and updated, with great hot water (which was much appreciated at the end of the cold Dublin days)! Thanks for a great stay, Monica!"
5457387,447862422,5/4/2019,"Your place was great! Frodo melted our hearts!  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was super clean. WiFi and access to the room were easy and efficient. The earplugs were a great touch, but we did not use them. Theres an amazing breakfast place (2 pups) down the road and its very close to the oldest pub, St. Pats and about a 15/20 min walk from Temple bar. We stay at a bunch of air bnbs and we were happy to have found your listing.  Slight issue with noise, but not enough to cower away from booking. Just know if you are a light sleeper, utilize the plugs. Thank for the wonderful stay. "
5457387,449352205,5/6/2019,"Monica is a really great host. She is very friendly, helpful and has good recommendations for us. The place districts very close to the City Center. We will come back definetely."
5457387,450736492,5/10/2019,"A great location for exploring Dublin on foot. Amazing true local pub two blocks away at Fallons. A classic. Very good hosts and two lovely dogs that are super friendly. A fun place to stay, but a little noisy as it is right on the street. All in all, a very good place to stay."

5457387,455800836,5/20/2019,"We enjoyed staying at Monicas place. As other reviewers mention, theres a bit of street noise but this didnt bother either of us. There were even earplugs provided which we didnt make use of. The location is greatîno more than a 20min walk from anywhere we went in Dublin. Airport bus picks up about 10mins away. The private bathroom down the hall is stylish and recently renovated. Our only real complaint is we didnt get to meet the dogs!"
5457387,458762220,5/26/2019,"We would 100% recommend Monica's place! Not only is she an excellent host, her place is located in  a great location to everything! Monica was easy to communicate with, she was super helpful, and great to visit with!"

The room is tidy. The bed is very comfy. The window goes out to the street but if you are a light sleeper, there are earplugs in the room available.
The bathroom is wonderful. A big shower and a skylight. What do you need more. 
Monica is a lovely host who will provide you with tips and welcome you into her home.
Jeffrey and Frodo are the big plus! Such nice and cuddly dogs. 
We recommend this room immensely!"
5457387,495563740,7/26/2019,"We cannot recommend Monicas Airbnb enough. Our trip to Dublin was made extra special by staying with her. Her home is in a central location, therefore many of Dublins highlights are just a short work away.

We really appreciated Monicas hospitality, her beautiful home and her gorgeous doggos. Both are extremely friendly and we loved getting to fuss over them during our stay. 

We cant wait to visit the city again, hopefully stay with Monica and her lovely family "

5457387,519789218,8/29/2019,"Monica was a great host and I felt very comfortable staying in her home. The room is well furnished, and having your own private bathroom is the cherry on top. You're an easy walk from any site you want to see, and but far enough away from downtown to be on a quiet street. I would recommend 100%."

She left us a file of recommendations which we used and found some great bars and pubs to visit. The room was clean and tidy, as well as in a great location with a short walking distance to everywhere we wanted to visit. To top it all off, Monica's pet dogs are very friendly and well-behaved and it was lovely to stay with them too. We couldn't recommend Monica's place more!"
5457387,531757224,9/18/2019,"Unlike impersonal or automated entry AirBnB's, Monica is a gracious host who is there to greet you. Her AirBnB space is clean and utilitarian with a comfy bed and good bathroom. Her dogs are well behaved and friendly too. Great location for exploring Dublin."

5457387,556352388,10/29/2019,"Fantastic stay, we were greeted at the door even when we arrived late. We felt so welcomed like we were staying with family. Everything was really clean and Monica gave us so many great suggestions for eating places. The pooches were the BEST PART. So much love and it was so good to stay with them. Being from Australia, we were so cold over there but the apartment is constantly warm, and was so nice to come home to after a day of adventures. The place is so close to everything, we walked everywhere. Would highly highly recommend this place. Also great water pressure and great temperature in the shower, this is always a big thing for me and it was great.

Nice room, newly furnished bathroom in the corridor. Monica was very helpful, waiting for us for a late check-in and also letting us store our luggages after the check-out. Heartly recommended!"

5458089,422890625,3/12/2019,The whole home and our flat was very cute and cozy! We didnt meet Ben but we met his mother and she was very nice and welcoming! Close to city center as well. I would absolutely recommend :)
5458089,425413868,3/18/2019,This space is exactly as described. Youll have the entire fourth floor to yourself. Really cute neighborhood in the wealthier section of town. 15-20 minutes to Temple Bar area. Perfect if you want to stay near downtown but not near all the noise. We walked to and from everyday. I was also sick during my stay and Ben and his mother checked up on me a few times which was extra nice. Would definitely stay again.
5458089,427825023,3/24/2019,Beautiful room in a great location perfect for exploring Dublin. Super easy checkin and check out and exactly as described. Would definitely recommend- thanks Ben!

Place was very private and a nice end for our busy Dublin days!"
5458089,463927992,6/4/2019,"We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are clean and the house is really nice. Location is close to city center. Taxi from Fleet Street (Temple Bar) was around 10-12 Euro. Bus stops in front of the house. If we come to Dublin again, Bens apartment would be my first choice again."
5458089,469180115,6/14/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again . Great location. 
Ben was a brilliant host who communicated with me prior to travelling & once we got to Dublin . The Aircoach drops you very near to the property & it was easy to find the coach stop at the airport terminal. Access to the building was easy as there was a key safe at the front door . The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed & the bathroom was clean & functional. There was only little things which could have made stay even better. A lock for the bedroom door . We locked are passports in the lockable bathroom when we went out  as we didnt like to just leave them in the room . Proper cups instead of paper cups would have been nice . 
Otherwise a perfect stay . Thank you Ben"

5458089,496188621,7/27/2019,"The apartment is very conveniently located, you can easily get there from the airport and several bus routes take you within minutes to the city centre.

The bed was a little too soft for me but the room itself is very nice!"
5458089,498690812,7/30/2019,Ben's place was great
5458089,499992873,8/1/2019,"Excellent location, within walking distance to the centre. The space is large, attractive and comfortable. Hosts we're always quick to respond."
5458089,510719921,8/16/2019,"Ben and Zachs Airbnb space is great- a self-contained area within their house, that is a healthy walk the other side of St Stephens Park to the main touristy areas.  Although on a well-used road, the space was quiet without traffic noise. Their communication was very responsive and I would definitely stay there again."
5458089,515124357,8/22/2019,Beautiful house in a great location. Room is spacious and clean. Bed is incredibly comfortable. Check in is easy and any queries are responded to quickly. Would fully recommend.

5458089,540359913,10/3/2019,"Ben's place was a great spot to stay for our short time in Dublin. The room was clean and had everything we needed. We appreciated the coffee and cookies that were left for us. We felt extremely safe in the area, and the location was super easy to find (we took the bus from the airport and the space was right across the street from the bus stop). The private bathroom was also a bonus. The street was extremely quiet and we slept very well. Would stay here again!"
5458089,542395945,10/6/2019,Thank you for a lovely stay in Dublin! It was great to be able to drop our bags off early and when we arrived the room was actually ready for us an hour early which was perfect! The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable and we had a really enjoyable stay. The house is right on the bus route into town and we even walked it a few times- 30 minutes flat walk into temple bar area. Ben's instructions on good places to eat and how to get around really helped
5458089,546182707,10/13/2019,Great Space! Highly recommend!
5458089,548360816,10/17/2019,We were amazed by the hospitality of our host! The place was comfortable and neatly equipped just in the right location. We strongly recommend!
5458089,553444672,10/24/2019,"Located quite centrally (20 min walk from Trinity college). 
Nice restaurants less than 5 min and a Spar opened until quite late. 
Nice and safe neighborhood, only a bit noisy from the room. 
Room perfectly fine and private bathroom in front of the room. 
Briefly saw Bens mom Sally, no particular contact with her."
5458089,556713888,10/30/2019,"A lovely place to stay with a welcoming host, a clean and tidy room and perfectly located if you want to stay just outside the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to walk in.  Offers great value for money and I would definitely stay again."
5458089,559501571,11/4/2019,"Fantastic house! Very central, easy check in and lovely hosts. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Dublin."
5458089,562111844,11/10/2019,We stayed at Bens for my first trip to Dublin. Its ideally situated an easy walk to several areas in the city and is easy to get to from the Airport.
5458677,423489757,3/14/2019,Great location! Exactly what I needed for my stay! I felt safe in the area. Was able to walk everywhere I wanted. I would stay here again!
5458677,432952471,4/5/2019,Fantastic location and welcoming reception. Fairly secure apartment and very clean. Recently renovated  with wooden flooring throughout. Can be a little noisy due to close proximity to the entrance gate and the main road but that is expectable in such a central location. Would stay again in future.
5458677,436134966,4/12/2019,Good value and located in Dublin city centre. Short walk to shops and restaurants. Can be a little noisy outside at times due to close proximity to the main road. Spar convenience store literally across the road. Would return again in the future.
5458677,440130487,4/20/2019,This apartment was very clean and comfortable. Its walking distance from many popular sites and I would certainly stay here again.
5458677,445503815,4/29/2019,"Charming one bedroom apartment just a few blocks off of OConnell St. Very convenient location. Good value when compared to hotel prices in that part of City Centre. Area can be a bit noisy, so come prepared with noise canceling headphones."
5458677,450415411,5/9/2019,"A nice, large apartment (much larger than any hotel room) with a super comfortable bed and fresh linens, lots of hot water, immaculately clean, great TV and channels - we caught up on Game of Thrones! I do think this was not a really good fit for us, an older couple with lots of luggage. We had to find a Dublin Visitor Center and check our bags while waiting for the room to be ready, which is later than most hotels would be, and hotels just accept and hold your bags. Making arrangements to do this and then check in took until mid-afternoon of a precious touring day. Younger people with only a rollaboard, and plenty of energy to walk around will probably like it just fine. There are some welcome touches, like plug adaptors and plenty of nice toiletries in the bathroom. The heat works well, which was crucial in Dublin's very chilly ""spring."" Fast wi-fi! The apartment and building are quite safe, but the neighborhood is a bit sketchy for a single woman, I'd think. It's only a few blocks from O'Connell street, the center of Dublin. David is a thoughtful host."
5458677,459282623,5/27/2019,Great location. Very clean. A lot of street noise as it is located on first floor and faces street. More noise on weekend night.
5458677,461383476,5/31/2019,Pretty accurate about Location but you are definitely getting what you pay for
5458677,461746869,6/1/2019,"Well located, very clean and good check in service"
5458677,465206790,6/7/2019,It was very clean and the perfect size! It was a really cute space and it was great walking distance from everything! There were all types of amenities that one may need and the building itself was extremely secure.
5458677,476550428,6/26/2019,"A great house for a couple, the house has the perfect size for 2 people, small and cozy, with all the facilities that we needed for a couple of days. The location is really good, closer to supermarkets, pubs and all the principal turistic places at Dublin. The host Carla was  a really nice preson and always replied me quickly to all my questions!"
5458677,476882146,6/27/2019,"Great apartment! The co-host was exceptional. The apartment location is not centrally located, but is easy to walk to local attractions. This apartment is on the ground floor on the street and you can hear people walking by, which I imagine may be a bit noisier on the weekends."
5458677,485613525,7/11/2019,Davids place is in a great location close to the city centre and night life! It was clean and communication was great! Only thing is it is very noisy but this is expected due to the busy street and location! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone
5458677,490353180,7/18/2019,Great location and wonderful apartment for your Dublin adventure. Be aware that it's on a busy street and noise might be a factor.  Near wonderful Chinese restaurants.
5458677,492430266,7/21/2019,"While this apartment was clean and well maintained, it was much further from city centre than we were expecting."
5458677,513866961,8/20/2019,"Nice place, friendly people."
5458677,520342614,8/30/2019,"Nice place, close to main street."
5458677,525239705,9/7/2019,Very accommodating and great location!
5458677,527693314,9/11/2019,"Location is great, walking distance from most places downtown. Flat has everything a guest may need, and Carla (the Caretaker) is great!"
5458677,532806335,9/20/2019,It is very central to public transportation and lots of pubs and restaurant. I work from my laptop and the wifi was great and stable. We would definitely stay again.
5458677,535453911,9/24/2019,"Nice appartment, very close to the center and pub.. very nice!!!"
5458677,539399020,10/1/2019,Perfect place to stay!
5458677,540914438,10/4/2019,Nice place. Great location.
5458677,542411760,10/6/2019,"This is a great sized and simple place that is very comfortable and safe. The location is a bit of a walk into the main area of the city, but it is still a great location. Also, it can be a little noisy as the apartment is on the street level, but we overall did not have a problem. The hosts are amazing and made everything very comfortable and easy!"
5458677,559524393,11/4/2019,"Apt does not look like newly renovated at all, there is a big painting spot on the wall, the kitchen door has no handle and other small detail like that.
Host is great, responsive quick and helpfull.
Price Is quite high for what it offer (electricity is not included in the price)"
5461737,419057655,3/3/2019,"Lovely, clean house in a great location for walking to all of Dublin's attractions, shopping and night life. Thoroughly recommend."
5461737,429511039,3/28/2019,"This house was in the perfect location, just outside of the major bustle, but close enough that we could walk anywhere. The only downside was figuring out parking,  but knowing ahead of time made it easier to plan! I would definitely stay here again."
5461737,431022107,3/31/2019,"Great stay, walking distance to everything we wanted to see!"
5461737,437112535,4/14/2019,"This townhome suited our needs just fine. It was comfortable and quiet, the washer and dryer worked well (actually dried the clothes!), the rooms (both upstairs) were fine, and the bathroom and kitchen (both downstairs) were nice. The stairs were a bit cumbersome in the middle of the night to get to the bathroom, being squeaky and with the bottom two steps being so small, but it was fine. I thought that the location was perfect!! I loved being in the Liberties, away from all tourists, but near plenty of bars and restaurants with locals. We walked everywhere easily. Id definitely stay here again - I felt like a local."
5461737,440688962,4/21/2019,"A lovely home just outside of the city centre and a walk away from Temple Bar. The house was clean and well furnished with comfortable beds and pillows. Netflix on the TV was great!
Communication with Keith was quick and helpful. The check-in/out process was really easy.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"
5461737,444109198,4/27/2019,"Keith has a lovely place, check in & out was easy and hassle free. We had an issue with the tv/internet which was quickly corrected.
The Liberties is great quaint area with great little shops, great location and within easy walking distance to Guinness Brewery and Temple bar."
5461737,445393871,4/29/2019,"Lovely cottage, perfect for a few days in Dublin. Well located near the city center, in a cute neighborhood. The house was also very clean and we appreciated the basic supplies at our disposition¬†! Would recommand¬†!"
5461737,447872965,5/4/2019,"We had such a nice few days in Dublin. Very nice place to stay, great location and exeptional communication. Id highly recommend staying here."
5461737,455223627,5/19/2019,"Great little house. Very clean, great bedding. There were 6 of us and we all managed to shower in the morning with hot water .. just don't let the water run all the time. About 15min walk to Trinity College. 5 min to Guiness and Teeling distillery.  Convenient little shop around the corner. Calm street."
5461737,458005154,5/25/2019,We can recommend the house of Keith. Its a lovely little house 15 min away (by foot) from the temple bar. Everything is clean and you have all the stuff you need in the house. Check in and check out is easy with the key box. We had a great time and enjoyed Dublin.
5461737,460411475,5/29/2019,This cozy apartment was in a great location and well appointed.  Clean and stylish with comfortable beds. The stairs are steep which was challenging for those with me that had mobility issues but that was the only minor issue we had. Keith as very patient with our changing schedule and was very quick to respond. I would highly recommend staying here.
5461737,462733038,6/2/2019,Keith was easy to deal with and responded quickly. Awesome location. A stones throw from the Storehouse and 16 minutes walk in to central Dublin
5461737,466434797,6/9/2019,"Perfect for a weekend in Dublin, central location, spotless and kitchen had everything you would ever need."
5461737,468361938,6/12/2019,This home was in a great central location very close to all the main attractions as well as providing a nice quiet place to relax at the end of the day.  It was perfect for us.
5461737,472714034,6/20/2019,"Loved the location 
House was super clean
And was able to accommodate 6 comfortably"
5461737,475965086,6/25/2019,Our family of three was very comfortable here.  The washer/dryer was a terrific convenience.  We dont mind walking so ditched our car back at the airport after getting our stuff in and were able to get around everywhere by foot.  The Lidl supermarket nearby has a great selection of affordable foods!
5461737,478724457,6/30/2019,"We had a great time staying in your quaint cottage in The Liberties.  The location was perfect for seeing the sights, an easy walk to many of the local favorites.  The sofa bed was comfortable, the linens are stored inside the long section.  We would love to return for a future visit."
5461737,482293615,7/6/2019,Great location and beautiful apartment!
5461737,484164037,7/8/2019,"Keiths home is in a great spot for your time in Dublin - very close to Guiness Storehouse and an easy 15 -20 Min walk to Temple Bar area.  
Best suited for a group of 4 adults - as we were 6 adults and found it to be tight quarters  but certainly do-able.   Keiths home is lovely and he is a good, efficient and prompt communicator."
5461737,486298536,7/12/2019,We loved the location and Keith was a very responsive host. The space is a little small and 1 small bathroom but we made it work for 5.
5461737,489712779,7/17/2019,"We had a nice stay at Keiths place. It was clean and nicely decorated. However, while this pace technically sleeps 6, we felt cramped with a family of 5. Perhaps it would be better for littler kids but we have teenagers and it was a bit small for us.  Check in process was easy and had no issues while staying there."
5461737,512132497,8/18/2019,"The house's location is great.
It is a small and cosy house, perfect for a short trip (I stayed for 5 days). It was perfect for four people despite the size of bathroom."
5461737,516540456,8/24/2019,Apartamento en una ubicacion excepcional. Barrio muy bien situado para conocer a pie la ciudad y con supermercados y pubs muy recomendables en la zona ( por si quieres vivir otra experiencia de Dublin que no sea la de Temple Bar )
5461737,521123013,8/31/2019,Keith was easy to communicate with and his place was great. His place is super close to everything we basically walked to get to all the attractions. Highly recommend staying with Keith!
5461737,522502300,9/2/2019,Great accommodation in an excellent location at a reasonable price.
5461737,524125762,9/5/2019,"Nice communal space and about a 20 minute walk to main areas for food, drink etc. Well equipped kitchen for eating in."
5461737,529218437,9/14/2019,"The location and ease of this Airbnb was perfect!! The space was great and provided a landing pad with perfect location and needed level of comfort for our short stay.
The space was a bit tight for 4 grown men, we anticipated tight but was a little tighter squeeze than anticipated. Id recommend for 3 men (or less) over adding the 4th on the couch for just a bit of added comfort during your stay.
The handle on bathroom door gave us a bit of trouble but the rest of the group who had small troubles simply didnt read the signage and directives easily left for those who stay.
Overall we enjoyed our stay in this Airbnb and would recommend (for groups smaller than our own). :)"
5461737,530702792,9/16/2019,"The house was smaller than I expected, but was quite cosy. Actually brought me and my friends a little more together. The beds were comfy and I really liked the thick pillows. The kitchen had everything that was needed, an oven, fridge and all spices and sauces."
5461737,548273172,10/17/2019,"Keith's place was great.  We arrived a bit earlier then expected, and he happily accommodate us.  We had some questions on how things operated, his response was quick and thorough.  The location was centrally located, we walked everywhere we wanted.  *As previously noted the stairs are steep,  narrow and a bit slick."
5461737,551456709,10/20/2019,"We had a good stay. Can walk into town in 15 mins. The local area is a bit run down so you would want to always head into Dublin City. 
Compact house but offered what we needed as spent most of the day out and about"
5461737,562095074,11/10/2019,Really lovely house. The sofa bed in the living room works very well as an additional bedroom as it's separated from the bathroom and kitchen by a door. Great location and fantastic host.
5461737,568456044,11/24/2019,Amazing
5496959,508088516,8/12/2019,"Good ubication, 10 minutes by bus 79/79A/40 to the center of The city, the stop bus is in front of the house. The flat is perfect for three persons and Patrick respond quickly any dubt."
5496959,514479166,8/21/2019,A nice apartment in a central location.    Patrick is responsive and flexible.  I would definitely stay there again.
5496959,516439925,8/24/2019,This place is a convenient bus ride to city center where there is lots to do and explore. Patrick is always available for questions and is easy to communicate with. The train tracks are extremely close to the building and are quite loud but stop running between 12am and 6am. Other than that this is a nice place to stay for 1-2 people.
5496959,523811057,9/4/2019,"Patrick's place was very nice, great environment to be in. Very communicative when needed and accommodation."
5496959,525234149,9/7/2019,Patricks house was a good place to stay. Easy bus connection to the city.
5496959,525928966,9/8/2019,"Lovely apartment situated about a 20 minute bus ride outside of the city centre. Patrick was lovely, patient and helpful and friendly, replied quickly to all messages and questions. The apartment was lovely and spacious with a balcony, and WiFi in a quiet location except for the odd train going past but that wasn't really too much of a bother!"
5496959,529907468,9/15/2019,"Great location, parking was useful for us! Very very helpful and accommodating. Would stay again!"
5496959,537325317,9/28/2019,Patrick was very accommodating but cleanliness could be better and train noise was an issue.
5496959,546101797,10/13/2019,"I have stayed here with two other people over the weekend and it was still comfortable. Great connection to the city center by public transport. Patrick is a great host, helpful and very quick to respond."
5496959,555892125,10/28/2019,"Good host, nice place, close to city."
5496959,568470014,11/24/2019,"Its not too bad, next time a little bit more cleaned. Patrick was very nice."
5520465,440947612,4/21/2019,"Dolores and her family were wonderful! They accommodated our last minute request, and provided a warm welcome to the house. The neighborhood is adorable, and the people so friendly!"
5520465,478667941,6/30/2019,Delores and her family were fantastic hosts and this home is uniquely wonderful.  The neighborhood is very charming and very safe while close to transit options to explore Dublin and beyond.  My family had a truly unforgettable month staying in this home and we hope to do it again some day.
5520465,530757986,9/16/2019,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5549787,419607715,3/4/2019,"The apartment's location is within walking distance to everything. The building has elevator so you don't  need to carry luggage ups and down. The apartment is decorated nicely, and the washer/dryer is a huge help. Communication with Cathal was always fast and easy. She is also very flexible with early check-in or late check-out. We would definitely recommend her place to anyone traveling to Dublin."
5549787,431956512,4/2/2019,"Good area to stay - good communication from the host. Had a lovely time. 

Only thing Id say is there was some wear & tear, however this is expected."
5549787,437857137,4/15/2019,Great location. Great space. Four adults fit comfortably.
5549787,440135276,4/20/2019,"Great 2 bedroom apartment close to public transport. We used the hop on hop off bus which picked us up across the road. Close walk to temple bar tourist district (5-10min) and other attractions. Had everything you needed in the kitchen for cooking. Beds were ok, but a bit old and sunken. Coffee shops downstairs and a express grocery store across road. Building is safe. Enjoyed my stay."
5549787,445376654,4/29/2019,Great location and good communication from Cathal. The Cathedral Cafe and Two Pups Cafe were both delicious. Bed was comfy. Would recommend.
5549787,445882122,4/30/2019,"Cathal's apartment is perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin, near St. Patrick's Cathedral and Francis Street. Her instructions/communication were quick, clear, and helpful and we really appreciated being able to check in early so we could drop our luggage and go explore! The space is well furnished, clean, and very spacious. Make sure to check out her welcome binder for tips about great places to eat, drink, and enjoy. We would definitely return in the future!"
5549787,449261132,5/6/2019,"Lovely place, spotlessly clean and really close to Vicar street which was perfect for us"
5549787,451222018,5/11/2019,"Perfect location to feel a little like a local! The Cathedral Cafe on the other side of the road serves a fabulous full Irish Breakfast. A must. 
Walking distance to several bus stops as well as St. Stephen's Green, Teeling Distillery and the Guinness Storehouse. Also near city centre and about 20 minutes away from Trinity College.
Your lovely host has tea, coffee, sugar and a French press available. There is a supermarket in the same block. Very convenient!
Earplugs are -unfortunately- necessary, but also provided. Check-in /out is super easy - and very ""Dublin"". Love it!"
5549787,452483135,5/13/2019,"Great location, clean, perfect for 2 couples."
5549787,452880793,5/14/2019,Cathal's apartment was perfect for us. We were going to a show in the Olympia and it was very close walking distance for us. Beds were comfy and the apartment was very clean and perfect for 2 couples. Very close to main city center and plenty of amenities near by.
5549787,453961289,5/17/2019,Great location to do things. However there is a big construction project going on across the street that is very noisy. Plus the nightlife is very loud there. Still worked around everything and it was just a short visit it worked for us
5549787,456323359,5/21/2019,"This AirBnb is in a perfect location. It is 1/4 block from a mini market, 1/2 block to St Patricks Cathedral and a Hop on Hop off bus stop. In addition just around the corner there is a city bus stop (across the street from St. Patricks). We caught the bus here twice to go up the street to Christ Church Cathedral ( which is within walking distance as well). Both times the City Bus drivers when we asked do you go to Christ Church and asked how much was the fare just waived us on without payment. It was only 2 stops away. It is also an easy walk from Christ Church to Dublin Castle and an easy walk from Dublin Castle to St. Patricks. All 3 of which are must sees. We didnt go to the Ginness Storehouse but it is also within walking distance. 
The unit is very nice and we really enjoyed our stay. It gets a little noisy around 7:30 am because of all the early morning traffic but was very quite at night. The elevator was real handy. We would stay here again if we are ever in Dublin."
5549787,457491778,5/24/2019,"Great place, Cathal is very quick to respond to questions and very helpful."
5549787,458011509,5/25/2019,"Had a wonderful stay! It was our first night in Dublin after flying from the US, so we spent most of our time sleeping. Bed was very comfy! Great location and within walking distance of many attractions. Would definitely stay again!!"
5549787,460010258,5/28/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin.  On the fringes of the busiest places.  Felt we were more locals than tourists.  Would recommend this without hesitation.
5549787,463494028,6/3/2019,Great location. Clean and convenient.
5549787,465788332,6/8/2019,"Cathals apartment is the perfect place to stay when visiting Dublin! It was a great location within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. Two cozy bedrooms with comfortable beds, a bathroom, living space, kitchen, and small balcony. Cathal left great tips for our stay and checked in on us to ensure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend!"
5549787,467520489,6/10/2019,This lovely apartment is in a great location. The elevator made hauling luggage so much easier.
5549787,467913719,6/11/2019,This was our first stop on our Ireland road trip and it was beyond perfect! Perfect location to walk to all major areas but not too close that we had to worry about extra noise. Cathal was a gracious host and answered my call when we had parking questions. The biggest thing Cathal helped us with was acting urgently to mail us something we left behind! We cannot thank her enough as a host and for her great space!
5549787,472756995,6/20/2019,"Our stay was great! The apartment is located near everything we wanted to see in the city and was well maintained. Cathal was quick to send a message making sure everything was going ok (a message I missed due to the app not sending me notifications while I was over there). The only minor hiccup we had is that the checkout instructions stated to leave the keys in the mailroom - accessible by a key provided. Unfortunately, unaware to Cathal, a keypad lock had been added to the mailroom preventing us access. I contacted Cathal via the app, and she responded instantly with further instructions. We could not have been happier with our stay.  The only other thing I would like to add is that for some reason the taxi drivers had a hard time finding the apartment with their GPS. This was quickly remedied by just telling them to take us to Fallon's Pub by St. Patrick's Cathedral."
5549787,474732827,6/23/2019,Cathal's apartment location was great and right across the street from St Patrick's cathedral. The apartment was very nice and comfortable for the four of us. The walk was 15 minutes to the Temple Bar area of Dublin. Picked up the keys at a cute pub across the street from the apartment.
5549787,477017994,6/27/2019,"The location is GREAT , the apartment is clean , organized  and a good value.

5549787,481725439,7/5/2019,"Cathals place was amazing! It was clean and the location was fantastic, right near St. Patricks and a quick walk to Temple Bar area. Her apartment was also beautiful, I wish I got to stay a couple more nights there. Would highly recommend staying at Cathals place if you are in Dublin."

5549787,485152334,7/10/2019,"Cathal has a lovely space in a great place in Dublin. Walking  distance to Saint Patricks Cathedral and Christ Church. Several restaurants in walking distance and grocery stores, etc. The house is spacious and the WIFI worked really well. All kinds of little touches like coffee, paper towels, spices, etc. for cooking. We were especially grateful for the washer and dryer at the end of our trip. I highly recommend this space. I cant imagine you finding one much better. Great value, spotlessly clean and easy checkin. Just book it!"
5549787,486135337,7/12/2019,Great location!  Would stay again!
5549787,486826998,7/13/2019,"Great place. Very good location, walking distance to city centre. Very quiet due to double glazed windows. Clean and comfortable"
5549787,492225991,7/21/2019,"Cathal was fantastic at communication and well above and beyond to help us out when we had a 13 hour delay with our flight. The location of her apartment is excellent and you can walk to every where. The apartment is exactly as described and worked great for start of our Ireland vacation. Would stay here again for sure.  Can't thank you enough for all your help. Mike, Carrie & Ross"
5549787,493969654,7/23/2019,An amazing place with lots of adventures close by.  You will have no issues finding dining options and it's in a very convenient location.
5549787,494537551,7/24/2019,Location is everything at this place. We were only here for 1 night and it worked well for this. We were right across from St.Patrick's Cathedral. Pretty much a 10-15 minute walk from most places. Cathal helped with any questions we had.
5549787,500413956,8/2/2019,"This apartment worked out perfectly for our family of four.  There was plenty of room.  The neighborhood was great.   We could walk to pretty much everything we wanted to do.  

Fallon's across the street was the perfect place to end each evening with a pint or two of Guinness.  We loved everything about Dublin and this apartment."
5549787,505561670,8/9/2019,Cathal was great at communicating! We had an issue with the hot water when we first arrived but he arranged for it to be sorted out the same day. Good location and plenty of room! Thank you for having us Cathal!
5549787,509298296,8/14/2019,"This was a great location, it had a lift (we had a lot of luggage and my dad is elderly, so that was nice!), and Cathal provided us the opportunity to check-in early and that was greatly appreciated, and her communication before was very helpful, detailed, and accurate. Just wish it had been a little cleaner. The refrigerator smelled and had food bits still in drawers, we pulled dirty glasses out of the cupboard, and bath towels were left out to air dry to be eco-friendly but that wasnt a very welcoming sight and the open window let TONS of flies in. This was easy for just a one-night stay, close to lots of Dublin attractions, and spacious enough for our group of four adults."
5549787,513320586,8/19/2019,"Cathal was a great host. Very quick and helpful communication. Very easy check-in and out. Great location, with plenty of cafes nearby and walking distance to plenty of Dublin sites. Plenty of room for my family of four. Definitely recommend this place. 
Did get a bit loud at night with the pub across the street, but it added to the charm for us."
5549787,515127301,8/22/2019,"Clean, modern apartment with easy check in / check out arrangements. Lots of local tips and communication from Cathal. About 20 minutes walk to Temple bar area, 40 minutes to RDS arena (as we were staying for a concert there)  ideally situated for us"
5549787,518895802,8/27/2019,Nice and clean apartment; conveniently located. Cathal was quick to respond and very clear in her instructions. Check-in and check-out were exceedingly easy. Would definitely recommend.
5549787,520461680,8/30/2019,"Great location for walking to most all attractions within Dublin. 
The layout of the place works well for more than 3 people. 
Very noisy at night though. Need to keep the windows closed and hope they block it!
Grocery right across the street and a good coffee place right by the building too. 
Cathal is very responsive to questions and feedback."
5549787,520907541,8/31/2019,Convenient to everything.
5549787,523371261,9/3/2019,"We highly recommend Cathal's place! Check-in was very easy, the apartment was clean, and the location was great for walking to nearby restaurants and historic sites. The bed was also very comfortable and allowed us to get a good night of sleep before flying home."
5549787,524120744,9/5/2019,Cathal's place was in a great location within walking distance to all of Dublin's attractions. Cathal was a very responsive host and the apartment was a large space. If you have a car like us we found street parking in Francis St that is free from 7.00pm to 7.00am. Check-in was simple and make sure you have a guiness across the road at Fallon's. We had a great time.
5549787,527196398,9/10/2019,Very comfortable place in a great location.
5549787,529849455,9/15/2019,We had a great time and we would book this apartment again.

5549787,538843913,9/30/2019,The location was perfect to walk and know the city. The street is a little bit noisy but nothing crazy. The apartment was very clean and the bed very constable.
5549787,544125559,10/9/2019,"This is a nice, clean two bedroom flat.  Plenty of room and amenities.  The host, Cathal is extremely responsive and helpful.   It is on the third floor of an apartment building but the lift worked very well. Would recommend it if you are looking for a two bedroom flat."

5549787,553997231,10/25/2019,Cathals place is perfect for a small family or two couples. It is perfectly located with everything you want to see in easy walking distance from the apartment. Considering the location it can be a little loud outside later in the evening (we stayed on a Thursday night so it was probably a busier evening) but it was no trouble getting to sleep. I highly recommend  staying here!

5570464,444624833,4/28/2019,We spent a night in Sinead's house during our holidays. We were perfectly received and the house is in a very nice and practical neighbourhood. The house is not very big but well equipped. Thanks a lot!

5570464,470637514,6/16/2019,"We had an amazing time during our weekend in Dublin, made extra special by how lovely Sineads property was where we stayed throughout our visit.

Its a lovely house on a quaint little estate on the outskirts of Dublin, there were good public transport links nearby but we enjoyed making our way on foot the short distance into the city, around a 25 minute leisurely walk.  There was a lovely pub (Arthurs) on the way to break up the stroll if needed.  

The house was much better than we had expected for the very reasonable price.  It was spacey, yet cosy with a lovely feeling and lots of stylish touches and trinkets which made it feel very homely.  It was fully equipped with all the amenities and utensils that you would expect and the kitchen had everything we needed.  There were two double bedrooms and a very large family bathroom with a full sized bath and a lovely powerful shower.  The heating could be put on when needed and was very effective.

There was a lovely little courtyard style, private back garden with wrought iron table and chairs.  

Check-in was simply a case of knocking on the next door neighbours door to collect the keys from Mary, who also manages the cleaning of the property and she was lovely.  Communication from the host Sinead was first class, both leading up to and during our visit.  We were even allowed to check-in earlier than advertised which was a massive help due to how early our flight arrived.  

We thoroughly enjoyed the freedom having our own property allowed during our trip, especially as it worked out cheaper than most hotels and even some hostels in Dublin.  We cant wait to return to this beautiful city and beautiful property."
5570464,482402415,7/6/2019,The place was small but adequate for 4 people.  Check in and check out was easy!  Sineads place was clean and her neighbor Mary was awesome!
5570464,500487265,8/2/2019,"Sinead hosted us in her own apartment. Located in a typical neighborhood of bricks houses, 20 minutes by bus of the city center. The inside is not recent but cosy with a ""soul"" and clean. Perfect stay for a trip in Dublin."
5570464,504236238,8/7/2019,"Locality great,  A Clean House in  & Safe Residential Area, Easy check in & out, home from home Style Accommodation with Parking,"
5570464,515206215,8/22/2019,"Good host, grand place"
5570464,532732390,9/20/2019,"Outstanding location, safe, clean and comfortable home. The bedrooms are upstairs so our sleep was very quiet. The driveway was perfect instead of the street. Sinead's description was spot on so we knew exactly what to expect. We enjoyed a glass of wine in the adorable back yard. I loved the french press for coffee in the morning. 

We very much appreciate the location and were able to walk to Guinness as well as restaurants and shopping.  The building is incredibly beautiful, built in 1917. We loved imagining the history.

The drive to the airport was close and easy in the morning. It took us 25 minutes. Thanks for Sinead's advice, we were prepared for a bit of traffic even at 6am. 

Thank you!"
5570464,534915946,9/23/2019,Great host! Very precise and fast communications. The house was gorgeous and in a nice centric neigbourhood ^^

5570901,419612729,3/4/2019,"We had an amazing time exploring Dublin while staying at Andrew's place. The space is exactly as advertised- spacious, amazing views, clean. It is close to a lot of great local pubs/food and a short (5-10min) walk from the centre of town/temple bar area. We went to a lot of places they had suggested and loved it. Andrew and Leo are so friendly and welcoming. I would not hesitate to book their place again!"
5570901,422542289,3/11/2019,"Welcoming hosts! Everything was perfect! Identical as per the pictures, and clean. The private bathroom, and private balcony... make you think you are in a hotel room. All the infos, brochures and maps are on the desk when you arrive. You think it cannot get better, then you meet Andrew! He is attentionnate, helpfull, and very welcoming.
If youre lucky as us, he might make you a coffee! We will be back for sure! Location wise, couldnt be better for us... we walk everywhere. 15- 20 minTaxi to the airport!
Thank you for everything! :)"
5570901,425928732,3/19/2019,"Absolutely the BEST place to stay !!! 

First: Communication is prompt and clear.

Second: The location is directly across from the Jameson Distillery in Smithfield Square (two blocks from the tram line). It's was a very easy walk to Guinness and Temple Bar.

Third: The space is clean and exactly as described and pictured. 

Fourth (and most important): Andrew and Leo are amazing hosts. They are extremely considerate, fun loving people who went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was perfect. I can't thank them enough, and will definitely be staying here again if I'm ever back in Dublin."
5570901,427936735,3/24/2019,Nice and quit location with good connection to the city
5570901,431616114,4/1/2019,"The room is everything you will need for a great night sleep.  The bed is comfy and bathroom is clean with great linens.  The location is perfect for Hop on off bus, great restaurants and night life.  But the real treasures in this booking are the hosts Andrew and Leo.   We had not stayed in many shared spaces.  Our time in Dublin was so much richer having them to give recommendations, relax at the end of the night, and to give us a bit of Irish hospitality.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else if we return to Dublin."
5570901,434107453,4/7/2019,A perfect home base for a weekend exploring Dublin - thanks Andrew and Leo!
5570901,449339884,5/6/2019,"Andrew is such a great host and his place was amazing. The space is very modern with lots of natural light. The location and views were top notch. Andrew offered great suggestions and insight on the area. We found our experience delightful and inclusive. It was easy to navigate Dublin from this location and bonus, there was parking on site. Highly recommend!"
5570901,450365964,5/9/2019,"Andrew was great with directions & communications and gave us an overview of the city with great suggestions for places to eat and various attractions. Our room was very clean, bright, comfortable and in a great location.  We enjoyed our stay."
5570901,451911374,5/12/2019,A CONVIENENT LOCATION
5570901,455918334,5/20/2019,Andrew and Leos place is so nice! Penthouse suite is so bright and stylishly decorated. The room was set up to higher end hotel quality and was super comfortable. Theres even a balcony overlooking the courtyard and a rooftop garden. Leo and Andrew both gave us some handy local tips and are very friendly. We were so lucky to also catch a big festival for dogs in the square below the apartment on a sunday afternoon. Lively spot! Would love to stay again if were in town.
5570901,456752381,5/22/2019,"Dramatic top floor en-suite room in a 3-bed apartment with views over Dublin and access to kitchen and living room, with other rooms in use by the host Andrew who lives there.  About 10-15mins walk to Temple Bar, O'Connell St down the riverside or up to Phoenix Park / station.  In fact you could probably walk to pretty much all the key touristy sights in Dublin with a little more time (or take the bus) from here.  Interesting restaurants and pubs nearby.  Andrew very welcoming and informative about Dublin and what to see.  Recommendations - take the hop-on/hop-off bus  if you want to go to get a quick (2hrs) summary of Dublin sites, and if you want to go to Kilmainham Gaol book tickets before you get to Dublin! (and if you are English, be prepared to be made to feel very guilty for everything bad that has ever happened in Ireland!)."
5570901,458597939,5/26/2019,"Lovely room at a central location in Dublin. Helpfull hosts, and a Good experience!"
5570901,465281346,6/7/2019,"Andrew was such an incredible host and provided a wonderful stay in Dublin. He is a very kind, caring, hospitable, and knowledgeable host who gave my mother and I tips and tricks for our adventures. 

The house itself is in a great location and even has its own roof attached that you can go experience a 360 panorama of the city. 

Highly recommend this for anyone and would come back in a heartbeat ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5580328,421969396,3/10/2019,"We knew the appartement was well located, it even happens to be closer to some places than we thought (Dublin Castle, Christchurch, Dublinia, Queen of Tarts, bus stop to go to Howth, Phoenix Park) It was very clean and tidy, tea and coffee available, kitchen well equipped for cooking as we had many meals at home. Our flight was planned late by night and we arrived even later, by 1 AM, and still Micheal and his wife were available for us. Some little details also make the difference and help you travel lighter (umbrellas, bathroom stuff). If we ever come back to Dublin, we would definitely stay at the same place!"
5580328,423870923,3/15/2019,"Clean, comfortable space, well thought out for guests.  Lots of good information available for things to do from Micheal and also brochures/travel books  available in the apartment.

We had a quiet cozy apartment to ourselves. We did not use the kitchen but the water kettle was definitely useful for tea and drinking water."
5580328,428957556,3/26/2019,"The apartment exceeded our expectations. The location is deceivingly quiet based on its proximity to the busy Temple Bar area. The directions from the airport are simple and thorough, and we had very little difficulty finding the apartment. Micheal and his wife were very responsive and easy to communicate with, and it made us feel confident in navigating Dublin. Extra bathroom amenities were a plus!"
5580328,429958303,3/29/2019,"Everything about this place is perfect- location, accessibility, Micheals hospitality and thoughtfulness-we are 110% satisfied. He had lots of local tips and maps around to help us. Dont even hesitate- this listing is too great to pass up! It even looks out over a courtyard with a statue and history of Handel- SO cool!!"
5580328,432290309,4/3/2019,"Absolutely amazing space and location. Convenient to everything...We walked everywhere in every direction.

5580328,461807810,6/1/2019,"Staying at Micheals apartment was fantastic, and exactly as advertised, and more.

We loved the vibrancy of the area, and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5580328,481219531,7/4/2019,"My wife and I really appreciated the fact that Michael came to find us when we got lost walking to his place. He was enthusiastic and very friendly. Showed us how everything worked. 

Space was perfect for us. Right on the edge of Temple Bar. Not noisy and it was homey.

Bed was firm but comfortable. We highly recommend this place."
5580328,483329409,7/7/2019,This was a lovely flat in a great area of Dublin! It was easy to walk around and the Airlink bus to/from the airport was very convenient. There were so many restaurants and bars nearby. We loved the little touches like having a (Hidden by Airbnb) chrome cast so we can watch movies on Netflix! The washer/dryer was also wonderful to have to wash some of our clothes from our long travels. Thank you so much! Would definitely stay again!

5580328,504885625,8/8/2019,Great central location. You can easily walk to most major tourist attractions from Castle to Trinity to Guinness factory to great shopping and restaurants. But expect to hear drunken yelling when you are trying to sleep as this place is a couple blocks from Temple Bar.. Nothing fancy but the place is well stocked.
5580328,510579970,8/16/2019,"Great apartment in the middle of the action, very clean.  Has all the amenities you desire.  Easy walking to get to attractions.   Would recommend staying here."

5580328,522469889,9/2/2019,Thank you so much for everything! Super friendly! Property was amazing and in the most fantastic location!
5580328,524702861,9/6/2019,"This was our fifth annual fall trip to Ireland, and found Michael to be an amazing host who provided us with many useful tips of where to go without getting sucked into the pricey Temple Bar tourist traps.   On that note, the place is very close to Temple Bar, but far enough away that it is a quiet, peaceful refuge.   

Checking in was a breeze with Michael meeting us outside place at an agreed upon time.  The condo is very well stocked, and comfortable.  The bathroom is modern with a proper flushing toilet and great shower, a rarity in many of the places we have stayed at over the years.    

The modern and spacious kitchen is nicely stocked with heavy stainless pots and pans, as well many condiments.  Some of the nice touches Michael has added are umbrellas for guest use, blue tooth speaker,  washer/dryer combo,  hair dryer.

As seasoned Airbnb travelers to Ireland, we highly recommend Michael's condo."
5580328,527217209,9/10/2019,"We found this apartment to be in a perfect location.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and yet it was quietly outside the chaos of the Temple Bar area.  Everything about the place was easy and convenient. Micheal was great fun to talk to and gave us a lovely introduction to the neighborhood, Dublin, and Irish sports. We took his advice and went to Darky Kelly's... it was fantastic! We would absolutely stay here again. Thanks Micheal!"
5580328,530096543,9/15/2019,"Perfecte ligging, super ontvangst, leuke tips, kortom een superverblijf !"

And despite being in the middle of the action, the overall noise level was minimal. Michael is an attentive host, and he provides all necessary amenities. Plus, the bed is really comfortable! We definitely recommend staying here."
5580328,535343478,9/24/2019,"Great little apartment in excellent location. Very quiet (apart from church bells all day & night). Good amenities, nice little sunny balcony, works well for 3-4 people."
5580328,537266177,9/28/2019,"Absolute recommendation if you intend to stay very close to lively temple bar, and seek to have a fairly nice, comfortable and quiet place to sleep!

5580328,544491802,10/10/2019,Can't say enough nice things about Michael and Maylene. We mistakenly booked the apartment for a day less than we needed and they bent over backwards to accommodate us. The place is in a prime location in Temple Bar and close to seemingly thousands of restaurants and pubs as well as the bus drop off and pick up areas to other cities/the airport. Also it was perfectly clean and nice! I cannot recommend this spot enough or thank these hosts enough. Truly.
5580328,545488394,10/12/2019,Micheals place was perfectly located to everything! It is by the night lifeù but still very very quiet.  He was extremely fast to respond and an excellent host. His place was clean and he also offers amazing history and tips for around town. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone who is staying in Dublin.
5580328,547954157,10/16/2019,"The location of the apartment is great, right in the center and yet quiet. The apartment is equipped with everything you need and also the communication and the check-in /out was uncomplicated."

5580328,555981171,10/28/2019,"An excellent little apartment, ideal for a short stay in Dublin. Well located, clean, lots of local information leaflets and an all round great place to stay."
5580328,560304152,11/6/2019,"Amazing location, my boyfriend and I walked everywhere we wanted and more! Great places to eat near by and sight seeing was easy. Very clean and great amenities. Was definitely worth it!! Great and quick responses from the host and great suggestions from them as well.

5596349,451930917,5/12/2019,The location worked well for us as we are comfortable taking a train. Why pay double the price to stay in Dublin. it's only a 20 minute train ride to the city centre for 6.25 euro. Also the town of Howth is just north of Sandy's air bnb. Howth is a fishing village with a nice trail to hike.
5596349,456680657,5/22/2019,"Hi there!
We had a wonderful time in Dublin and really enjoyed staying at Sandy's house. The room was very nice and clean. We had to share the bathroom with Sandy herself and other guests. The Check-in was done by Sandy's nice friend Suzanna.

Thanks for recommending to buy a so- called Leap Card (40‚Ç¨ for 7 days) to use all kinds of Public Transport in the Dublin area.

The room was just as described in the posting - however, bear in mind that you could be sharing a toilet/shower with up to 4 other people and there is no other access to water. This is the only downside to the accommodation. Otherwise, it was in close proximity to Malahide Castle, where we were seeing a concert, and to the city centre. Public transport was absolutely fine from here! All in all, great value for money."

The bedroom was comfortable, cozy, and clean and we really appreciated the additional amenities included, such as shower supplies and the hot pot, coffee/tea. Sandy was a gracious welcoming host, with lots of information for visitors. She was very responsive, and accommodating to our requests. Overall a 5 star stay, and one of our favorite air bnbs to date. Future travelers, take a day to explore Howth if possible, the cliff walk is beautiful! Thanks again Sandy!"
5596349,553131598,10/23/2019,"The house is lovely, clean and located close to the coast. Its easy to get to Howth. 
If you dont have time to spare take a taxi. The bus rout is beautiful but it takes some time from the airport."
5596349,555984602,10/28/2019,"Sandy was an amazing host. The communication was always very quick and she was very cooperative with our early check in and out! The place is very clean, she cleans the bathroom every day (there is a rain shower!). The bed is sooooo comfortable, very soft and just perfect after a busy day of walking around. The location is about 5mins from the Dart station from which you can get everywhere (25mins to Dublin). Also, if you want to explore Howth; its just 8 train minutes away! We really enjoyed our stay and the short daily banter we had with Sandy. Thank you!"
5596349,558817102,11/3/2019,"Nice place to explore Dublin. Near to the trainstation from where you can get to Dublin in about 20min. The room was very clean and the bed was confortable. On top Sandy gave us towels and hygiene products to use. Thank you that for Sandy ;) 
We would definitely recommend this place and are looking forward to our next jurney to Ireland."
5596349,563259233,11/12/2019,Sandy war eine super Gastgeberin. Immer wieder gerne.
5596349,563918467,11/14/2019,"Great stay, room perfect, great location - 5 min walk to Bayside DART station and 20 mins into the city, ample parking available around the house."
5596349,566380702,11/19/2019,"Had a great stay! Sandy's place is clean, quiet, and easily accessible by public transport about 20 minutes from Dublin's center. Very much recommend checking out Howth (a nearby fishing village with a nice seaside walk) while you're here as well."
5605620,493211454,7/22/2019,"We loved this place in Dublin! The location was great. We were within easy 3-10 minute walking distance to buses and green line tram (Cabra Luas), both of which took us to city centre quickly. The kids (11 & 14) loved the backyard trampoline. And they loved having their own rooms. We were able to use the washer and dryer, which was very helpful."
5605620,494402201,7/24/2019,"The Ruth's house town is really good situated in a quiet place close to shops, bakery, cafes... We really appreciate Cabra.
You can take buses or tramway to go to the City center of Dublin in 15 minutes.
We really enjoyed our stay here.
Dublin is a fabulous city!
Ruth is a great host, really helpful . And her house is perfect for a family of 2 or 3 kids.
My kids love your trampoline !
And as she is pets friendly, our dog (yorkshire) has discovered Dublin with us!! thank you so much for him!"
5605620,495488875,7/26/2019,"Great family home in central Dublin. Ruth is a great host, very responsive and helpful."
5605620,498100452,7/29/2019,"We had a very nice time at Ruth and Colins house. The place is bright and very nicely decorated, the neighbourhood is friendly. Also it is only about a 5min walk to the tramway that take you to trinity station. We had the chance to meet Colin and the kids, that are adorable!"
5605620,500507398,8/2/2019,"We had a great time. Definitely a bit of a walk into city centre, but we did it with two small kids and were just fine."
5605620,501311799,8/3/2019,Great access to the airport and Dublin attractions. Ruth was very good at communicating details and making sure everything was ok once we arrived.
5605620,503024962,8/5/2019,"The house is in a nice, friendly neighborhood.  It was slightly farther away from the city center than I expected but once I discovered the local tram system, it was only a 5-10 minute ride.  I would recommend this place"
5605620,507253215,8/11/2019,"We had a lovely stay here! The house is wonderful and we loved the bakery nearby! Its fairly easy to get to the Dublin centre and the area is quiet and nice. Ruth was very welcoming and responsive, she left a freshly baked bread and homemade jam for us. Such a pleasure to stay here!"
5605620,512135601,8/18/2019,"Ruths place is bright and welcoming. We went in to Dublin by taxi which cost about 12 Euros. Ruth left some bread and homemade Jam on the table and put fresh flowers about the house which was lovely. We didnt have children with us but if we did I dont think they would have wanted to leave the house with a trampoline in the garden, Netflix and gaming consoles etc. The price was great and This was a trouble free booking. Ruth was a fabulous host."
5605620,537888731,9/29/2019,"Loved this place! It's a bright and stylish family home with lots of nice touches - and a great location in terms of local amenities and quick access to the city centre. Plus, Ruth couldn't have been more helpful in the run up to my stay. Recommend!"

5616178,425423443,3/18/2019,"We had a wonderful stay at Imeldas home. I was a bit worried about staying outside of the city, but there is a bus stop and a train station close by. Imelda provided us with recommendations for apps to download to get around easier and we had no issues at all. Imelda was quick to respond to messages and questions we had, and the check in process was very easy. Our room was clean and had extra towels, toiletries and plug adaptors for us to use. A lovely breakfast was provided to us during our stay which was greatly appreciated. Thank you so much Imelda for being so kind and friendly. I wish we wouldve had the chance to talk more!"

Definitely a super host, no doubt. You wont be disappointed with your stay there! Also it is easy to catch buses from her home as well, so it is in a great location! Not too far from the bus stop nor the train station which makes it easy to get to the lovely coastal town of Howth and city center as well!"
5616178,437243049,4/14/2019,"Imelda is a very kind person.  I recommend you to stay in her house. Moreover, public transportations are very close."
5616178,440164599,4/20/2019,"I really recommend it as a good place for staying outside the city centre. the beds were incredibly confortable and Imelda offers a very good breakfast! She even had the kindness of making a bag of snacks for us since we were leaving very early! The bathroom was shared with other guests and there was no big deal about it, however there were a limit-hour of 21h in the evening for taking a shower (because of the noise it makes), and that is something to consider if you want to hang out all day in Dublin and get back late craving for a shower - that's not possible there. Overall, a confortable stay with a very good price for Dublin!"
5616178,442767217,4/24/2019,Alles bestens!
5616178,444774318,4/28/2019,"Imelda is a super host, house is lovely and warm and clean also. Imelda is there if you need her and very happy to help."
5616178,449246609,5/6/2019,"We arrived early in the morning and Imelda was very flexible for us to check in early. This is a great location if you're going to be in Dublin. Transportation is great from here, buses or train is 10-15 minutes away walking. Make sure to use the leap visitors card if you will use public transportation inside Dublin"
5616178,452469276,5/13/2019,Excellent hospitality!!! Thank you!!
5616178,453660108,5/16/2019,Imeldas place we found great because we could securely park and leave our car. Easy transport to the city. Doesnt take long. Comfortable and clean bedrooms and bathroom.  Imelda gave us good instructions to get around. Great host.

5616178,462468858,6/2/2019,"we had a good time.
The house and the room are well. equipped, very clean and comfortable.
Imelda is a very good host
The city center is good to reach.
- thanks!"
5616178,467899132,6/11/2019,"We had a really nice stay in Imeldas place. The room and common areas were spotless. There were everyhting we need. Breakfast was waiting for us on the table when we got to the kitchen in the morning. She is such a nice and kind lady, we really enjoyed our small chats with her during our breakfast! 
The only thing we were not happy with was the location of the house. It was close to the airport but there were no direct transport, so if you dont take a taxi, you need to go to the city centre to go to the airport. For the city centre, DART and bus station was very close but their service wasnt so frequent. It takes 10 minutes to get the city centre by dart, however, one day we waited for 40 minutes to get on the train (maybe just because it was on sunday). Apart from that, the place was great! 
Thank you for being such a great host Imelda!"
5616178,470561750,6/16/2019,Great value for money accommodation
5616178,472304398,6/19/2019,Imelda is a great host and she ensures her home is a home from home for her guests
5616178,474506945,6/23/2019,"Imelda had very quick responses and was ready to help with any of our queries. Her place was very clean, comfortable and was close to bus stations; buses take about 20 minutes to the city centre. Overall, it was worth it for the price."
5616178,476066059,6/25/2019,"This is a great place and she has thought of everything including an adapter for travelers in a little goodie basket if you forget anything in addition to shampoo etc. The breakfast was awesome and had so many choices. Your plate setting was set up for you so nice. There is a shared bathroom but be aware you may be sharing with up to 4 other guests in two other bedrooms. It was sparkling clean and I didnt mind expect the constant traffic in and out. The floor boards and stairs are very very loud and I could hear everything going on in both rooms. Not all guests are loud but there was a lot of noise with shutting doors, talking, coughing, and going in and out. So bring earplugs or headphones if you are a light sleeper for sure. Imelda was so kind and asked how I slept and always offered me and chatted for a few minutes. The bus to town takes about 20 min and was explained very well. Lots of information is available in rooms and kitchen. There is also bull island close by for a bit different experience than downtown Dublin."
5616178,477025282,6/27/2019,"Very friendly host, very clean rooms, nice breakfast. We enjoyed our stay and will come again next time staying in Ireland."
5616178,480309942,7/2/2019,Imelda was great! She was there to greet us when we arrived and helped us feel at home. Imelda was extremely helpful with tips to get around the city and great places to eat.
5616178,515207800,8/22/2019,Fabulous place that's sparkling clean with a helpful host who has thought of everything. Definitely would stay again :)
5616178,517222189,8/25/2019,Well kept place with an organized and diligent host.
5616178,518900859,8/27/2019,"A great find! Imelda's place is lovely and an easy bus or train journey into Dublin city centre. Imelda is a great host, very welcoming and friendly. A good breakfast was provided and she also provided lots of useful information and a basket full of toiletries in case you'd forgotten something which is a thoughtful touch. We had a great stay here and would recommend Imelda's place to anyone travelling to Dublin."
5616178,519899999,8/29/2019,Very nice stay at Imelda ¬¥s house. The house is cosy and very well located. Imelda is very caring and reactive. She will make your stay very appreciable. I highly recommend Imelda as host.
5616178,522621839,9/2/2019,Imelda is a great host and I would definitely look to stay again if I were to come back to Ireland for travel!
5616178,527577491,9/11/2019,"Imelda is a friendly and welcoming host. The twin room was bright and airy,  spacious and very comfortable for the two of us. Bathroom was shared with other guests during our stay without any issues. The daily breakfast provisions provided are a lovely touch. We felt very much at home. Location was great for exploring Dublin city and returning to a quiet neighborhood at the end of the day."
5616178,528486791,9/13/2019,"Very clean and comfortable. Imelda is very fast to help you in any way. Answers in a flash. Very easy to get in and out of Dublin.
Thanks!"
5616178,531419761,9/17/2019,"I dont feel this location is the best.  I didnt think it was close to the city or the airport.  Its a nice quiet area and if youre a runner - there is a park down the street to have a run around the track.

So in summary:  bathroom sharing is not the best.
The walls are thin - there are 3 guest bedrooms upstairs and you can hear everything from their beep on their phone, coughing, snoring, and when they come in at night."
5616178,532292020,9/19/2019,"Lovely and homely accommodation near Dublin city centre with a clean, cosy room. The host, Imelda, is a bubbly and helpful woman who makes you feel at home!"
5616178,533845797,9/22/2019,Had a lovely time. Thanks again.
5616178,535469861,9/24/2019,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldnt of been better. Imelda takes pride in genuinely being a super host, thinking about what she would want as a guest and then offering it to those who come to her home. As well, she tunes in to her guests particular needs, in our case COFFEE !! For us we appreciated the continental breakfast that was an offer every day before we headed out. It was basic but with some variety of cereals toast and  buns. And coffee!
Imeldas response time is amazing, uncanny and we need more stars available to properly rate it!! We had an issue with trying to order takeout and we were sorry to bother her as it was in the evening. Didnt know what else to do.  the moment I sent a e-note to her I could hear her step upon the stair coming up to help us,  and cheerfully. Imeldas communications are clear and to the point and shes also a witty and warm person,  the quintessential Irish hostess! We enjoyed chatting with her.
The room is much cuter than the picture shows, with big windows and nice decor.  There is good storage so that the room is not cluttered when youre there with your luggage. The location requires some walking to get to transport, which as middle aged but healthy types we were fine with,  but If you have a significant mobility issues, maybe not for you as well as the room being on the second floor."
5616178,537191201,9/28/2019,"Things I loved:
-Great friendly host who was super kind and sweet from the moment I arrived
-Low cost 
-Room with a lock on the door, and a basket of items in case I forgot things like shampoo or toothpaste
-Quick and easy communication
-Near the airport

Things I didnt like:
-Not being told I wasnt the only person staying there during my visit.
-People loudly talking in the room next to me until 11pm or later
-Being woken up multiple times each night by people   leaving to go to the airport(2:30 and 4:30 am)
-Finding the bathroom dirty after other people used it, including blood on the toilet seat!!!!! 


Overall:
All in all this place was not what I thought it was. If I had known other rooms were being rented as well I wouldnt have stayed there. Plain and simple. The host was kind and generous, and easy to communicate with ahead of time. I only wish I had been told at some stage that other gusts would also be there as well since it made the house more of a youth hostel style environment that I was not okay with."
5616178,542358351,10/6/2019,"Staying here is very warm and comfortable. Feels like home. Imelda is a great host, she has everything you might need or might have forgotten and she let you use it ;) transportation around is good and easy, just better plan ahead your very very :) early plans during weekend as bus on Sundays goes only from 8 am."
5616178,555970046,10/28/2019,Imelda is a great host! Had a lovely time here.
5616178,561929140,11/10/2019,"Great  hospitality. Imelda provided tips, as well as all types of luxuries that made the stay much more pleasant than a hotel. Everything was ready, and described accurately."
5624357,476521918,6/26/2019,"Micheal and his wife Tula are very welcoming hosts, and I would happily stay with them again.
The room is a single, but the bed is comfortable and the room is very clean. The apartment is in a very nice area, Sandymount, within a few minutes walk of the village, the DART station and the beach. Great value, especially considering that this is one of the most desirable areas of Dublin in which to live. Breakfast (cereal, fruit juice and fruit) being provided is an added bonus."
5624357,478904313,6/30/2019,"Friendly, helpful and courteous host. Lots of local knowledge and tips. Great for a bit of a chat."
5624357,483328709,7/7/2019,Really fantastic location in an idyllic seaside neighborhood close to Dublin City Centre. Micheal was very hospitable.

5624357,486774635,7/13/2019,"I came over to Ireland on the late ferry, and Micheal's place was perfect for a stopover. It's located perfectly for central Dublin, and Micheal was very hospitable and also very flexible allowing me to arrive late. Would stay there again."
5624357,493403531,7/22/2019,This is a great location for access to central Dublin and to the coast. Nice quiet location but beside a great urban village location (Sandymount) with its restaurants and bars. On-site parking is a great attraction so close to city centre
5624357,497343574,7/28/2019,Michael and his wife were excellent hosts and were overall very nice. Their place is a short walk to the beach and also some good restaurants. It was exactly what I needed for my short stay in Dublin. I definitely recommend staying at their place.
5624357,499414606,7/31/2019,Nice room in this modern flat in a terrific location in Sandymount just outside Dublin City Centre

5624357,532293974,9/19/2019,Michael and Tula's cosy place was ideal for me as I had a work conference in the city centre for 1 night. Their place is close to the city and in a quiet area that close to the beach. The host made it easy for me by meeting with the key. I was made feel most welcome and would highly recommend.
5624357,536250853,9/26/2019,"Michael and Tula were wonderful hosts; extremely friendly and very easy going. 

The location is perfect for the Dart, busses and of course the beach for a lovely walk.

I had a cracking sleep and just really enjoyed my time here.

Thanks again Michael and Tula.

Cheers!"
5624357,537330428,9/28/2019,"Lovely host, great location. Took 5 min to walk to the train."
5624357,537887173,9/29/2019,"Good location, good value"
5624357,562114197,11/10/2019,Micheal is a wonderful host. He was really polite and very helpful. He even offers a simple and healthy breakfast to the guest which is always very welcomed.
5624357,564644324,11/16/2019,A warm welcome and a pleasant stay.
5624357,567723243,11/23/2019,"Michael was a great host, quick and accurate location details. Room was perfect. Great breakfast. Parking was very handy. Would highly recommend and hopefully I can stay again soon"
5624357,568363435,11/24/2019,Exactly as described. Lovely people. Great location.
5635315,538773458,9/30/2019,Pleasant host. Reasonably priced accommodation.
5656305,421339917,3/9/2019,"Overall my stay was fine. John's wife welcomed us and was very kind. She bought us bread and milk and was very kind to show us all the best spots in Dublin on a map that she annotated. The apartment is a bit of a walk from the main tourist attractions but it's a great little neighbor with a park nearby. Good restaurant options a 5 minute walk away and very close to the bus stop. On the downside, the place is moldy, especially the bathroom. I felt nervous to walk bare foot in the bathroom. It's very bare bones and small because it's not really a real apartment but rather an old closet or something transformed into an Airbnb. The only source of heat (which is essential in the winter when I visited) was an electric heater, which was not the best. During my stay the WiFi ran out, since it was a hotspot rather than a box. Unfortunately, it was impossible for John to give me a new one since the hotspot ran out at night on our second/last day. This place is a decent option for the budget traveler since it's the cheapest Airbnb available and cheaper than some hostels."
5656305,426914683,3/22/2019,"John was a great host. Hell help you out with any questions or requests you may have. He was very accommodating. The place is about an hour walk to the Guinness factory and about 45 to the temple bar. Not bad but not super close so keep that in mind. Overall, would stay again!"
5656305,429947125,3/29/2019,"We were greeted at check-in and got suggestions on what to see - although it is very easy to use public transport from the place into town, we walked all days with no problem, since it takes maximum 30 minutes. The best tip we got was to take one day out of Dublin to visit the seaside."
5656305,434115429,4/7/2019,"John was an amazing host, he was quick to respond, and we had a great welcome chat with him. He gave us loads of local tips and ideas on stuff to see and do, he was quite the guide to be honest. 

The place was neat and just what we needed. He gave us breakfast and every morning we would walk to downtown Dublin, which is nice and close by.

The only negative thing I have to say is that the hot water ran out pretty quickly, but we got used to it."
5656305,436066079,4/12/2019,"Johns place was conveniently located at the best spot between downtown and being able to easily get to the airport. Would highly recommend for any stay, but certainly even more if you are coming from our going to the airport the day of your stay."
5656305,438227539,4/16/2019,John has a great place!
5656305,442823180,4/24/2019,"The host was very nice offering us a lift to the city center by car, also they explained us the way for going to the best places and the studio. The location is good because you can go by feet to the city centre in 30 min, BUT the apparment looks bigger in the pictures and it is really dump so the smell is disgusting inside."
5656305,444025774,4/27/2019,John very friendly made us very welcome and told us some places to check out around Dublin what we didn't know about
5656305,447225119,5/3/2019,John is a perfect host. On arrival he greeted us and gave us tips. The room is ideal for two.  The property is 25 minutes away from the center.  We recommend!
5656305,448635677,5/5/2019,"John was very nice in giving suggestions about visiting the city and he had maps for us to use. He was available for us to contact him at any time, very kind."
5656305,460106350,5/28/2019,Great!
5656305,460883394,5/30/2019,"Simple, convenient stay at John's. Close enough to city centre and plenty of public transport options. With an extremely jet-lagged baby (and parents) John's house provided all we needed. Cheers"
5656305,463444971,6/3/2019,"Nice and clean accommodation, great communication."
5656305,465278748,6/7/2019,John is a great host. He waited for us and assisted with the bags. He had maps and suggestions ready. John is a host eager to please.
5656305,467319001,6/10/2019,"John was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Upon arrival, John gave us a map of the city and recommendations for pubs and attractions to see. Even better, he drove us to the Spire so we didnt have to walk the entire way. The room worked well for three students staying for one night, but was definitely a bit cramped for all three of us."
5656305,468867643,6/13/2019,"John was extremely nice and welcoming, there was coffee and other small things that made the stay good."
5656305,470581376,6/16/2019,"The room was perfect for our one night trip to Dublin, everything was as described and John was great to keep in touch with any queries we had."
5656305,476014431,6/25/2019,"Near the airport, good to find, very clean. John gives very good information. Very friendly...."
5656305,478020303,6/29/2019,"The apartment is close to City centre. We parked our car by the apartment and walked to the city. John had a lot of good information about Dublin, which we used alot."
5656305,481808473,7/5/2019,Great place to stay! Would stay again
5656305,491632896,7/20/2019,"John gave great recommendations about what to see and do and where to eat for dinner in Dublin. He also brought over a few things for us to have in the morning for breakfast, which was greatly appreciated!"
5656305,500412946,8/2/2019,Situated perfectly. John is a wonderful man.
5656305,503030302,8/5/2019,The room is nice and clean and everything you need is inside. John is helpful and easy to reach for arrival and departure.
5656305,503742743,8/6/2019,John is a great host. The place is basic. Good spot if youre there for a match at Crome Park and easy access to lots to eat and see.
5656305,512518579,8/18/2019,"John was very kind and gave us very good recommendations. He even offered to let us stay an extra day, as a result of nobody booking it that day. He had some breakfast for us, and the location was great."
5656305,515756929,8/23/2019,"John is a wonderful host. Kind, thoughtful, great communicator. Recommend anytime!"
5656305,517396749,8/25/2019,We had a very nice stay at John's appartement!
5656305,518789797,8/27/2019,Good for a short stay.
5656305,521674045,9/1/2019,Worth it!
5656305,523815349,9/4/2019,"Great spot, close to things via walking, plenty of parking when I stayed."
5656305,534059627,9/22/2019,"Really appreciated the fact that John let us check in at late hours and check out really early in the morning because of our flights. Also, you will  find a Europe to UK adapter.

Great location, 10-15 mins from Dublins city center if you go by bus. Approx. 35 mins on foot. Drumcondra is really pretty.

For a short 2 night stay, the studio is relatively ok considering  its price. It depends on how pretentious you are.

Even though the listing doesnt state anything thats false, these are some things I didnt like.

The shower base was pretty dirty. The showers curtain was also dirty with signs of mold.
We had to ask for Wi-Fi. We had working Wi-Fi 2 days later. The space is way smaller than  it looks like in the photos. Theres no window or working ventilation in the bathroom. The butter and one of the jam jars were already eaten from. Not really willing to eat after strangers. More towel hangers would be useful."
5656305,535473449,9/24/2019,John was great. Very personable and flexible! Wifi was down which was unfortunate as that was our only way to communicate with our families. Good for the value.
5656305,535844608,9/25/2019,Comfortable and quiet overnight stay for two in the back flat. Quite close to ferry port. Older style and fittings but clean and just a few stairs.
5656305,537298989,9/28/2019,"John is a great host.
He is very accommodating and helped us out a lot. He replied quickly and gave us useful tips
 It was a great stay."
5656305,538774237,9/30/2019,"Small touches that make the difference for travellers - coffee, bread, hairdryer. Very clean."
5656305,539875714,10/2/2019,"Nice place, John was very easy to get a hold of and the location is very good"
5656305,543738072,10/8/2019,"Very basic, good location, clean linen, place very tired and could do with a total make over."
5656305,547966244,10/16/2019,"Als je hier twee nachtjes verblijft, is dat prima te doen. Langer vind ik niet aan te raden.
De bushalte is inderdaad vlakbij, maar zorg dat je dan de juiste kaart koopt (de hop on hop off bus en de airlink stopt niet aan het einde van de straat).
Er was weinig voor ontbijt maar John ging speciaal voor ons wat kopen. 
In vorige recensies staat wat over vochtigheid en een nare lucht. Wij hadden daar geen last van maar dat kan ook komen omdat het prachtig weer was. 
Het tweepersoonsbed ligt prima, maar het eenpersoonsbed is alleen geschikt voor een  kind (dun matras)."
5656305,548309969,10/17/2019,"John was a wonderful host - he had maps for us and great information about the city. He was welcoming, and there was fresh milk and breakfast foods for us. Highly recommend."
5656305,550801065,10/19/2019,The profile is very accurate. Had a great stay.
5656305,553131844,10/23/2019,Very close to public transportation to city center and airport. John was very responsive and helpful with local sights and things to do!
5656305,553963744,10/25/2019,"John's studio flat is simply, but tiny and clean. We could reach the center of Dublin by walk. John is very kind and helpful man."
5664563,484087233,7/8/2019,"The bus to downtown (120) is right outside the house. The house is nice and clean, but the pictures could be updated. And not all amenities are functioning."
5664563,495721250,7/26/2019,"Staying at Catherine's was great! The house is cosy and perfectly sized for our party of four adults and three kids. We loved having the garden with the trampoline for the kids and for a glass of wine before bedtime. The house is situated close to both the tram and bus and even works for a walk to town.
Catherine is a wonderful, thoughtful host and quickly answered all questions we had during the stay."
5664563,502166977,8/4/2019,"Our experience with Catherine's house was extremely positive. 
Catherine was very friendly and helpful, yet not intrusive. She greeted us at our arrival and she even let us find what was needed for breakfast. She also gave us lots of tips and useful practical advices (restaurants, places to see, transport and so on). 
The house is very comfortable and matched all our expectations. It is located in a quiet, residential neighbor, yet easily connected with the city center by bus (the bus stop is just a few steps away), tram or train. 
I strongly recommend Catherine's house for a pleasant stay in Dublin."
5664563,511530225,8/17/2019,Catherine is a beautiful person and her home is great if you want to feel a home away from home x
5665724,422852102,3/12/2019,James's place is a great place to stay! Our few nights here were comfortable and enjoyable! James's hospitality and location made our trip in Dublin fantastic. Highly recommend his place to anyone near Dublin's center.
5665724,428504042,3/25/2019,We had a great stay with James. He was very accommodating and extremely helpful! His apartment is 10-15 min walk to the centre of town and is a good value in the city. Definitely recommend staying at James'.
5665724,434052781,4/7/2019,"James is a super friendly host, easy to communicate and happy to give you advice on what to do. The bed might be a bit small to fit two people comfortably for longer stays but for the two nights we were there it was just fine."
5665724,438320655,4/16/2019,"Jamess stylish and cozy Dublin home is made even better by the wonderful hospitality you receive - fantastic local recommendations, and a warm welcome after a long day exploring! We really appreciated Jamess and his housemates friendliness and the genuine and relaxed atmosphere they have created. We would not hesitate to recommend staying here!"
5665724,440697521,4/21/2019,"The location is very comfortable and quiet.
James is very nice and discreet.
He will help you if needed."

5665724,451796025,5/12/2019,"Had a great weekend staying at James' home. The place is very stylish and James and Colm were very welcoming. Their tips about the area were so useful.

Be sure to check out the cafe, it has great atmosphere and tasty coffee."
5665724,454061209,5/17/2019,"If you're staying anywhere in Dublin - you simply can't go wrong staying at James' place. Attention to detail, great hospitality and help are clearly his trademarks."
5665724,458054442,5/25/2019,"A lovely place to stay while in Dublin! James is quick to respond, and his house is a really cool space. Breakfast was set up each morning, and he gave us some great recommendations. Street is a little noisy outside, even with the window closed (tram going by, etc) - not a problem for us but could be if you're a very light sleeper. Bathroom was shared but we didn't have any issues. Very clean. 5/5!"
5665724,471351658,6/17/2019,James is a great host. Good location.
5665724,478666449,6/30/2019,James is a great host. His room is as described and his home is lovely. The breakfast provided was delicious and generous. Thanks James!
5665724,487510890,7/14/2019,"James is a fantastic host with an amazing home. We felt very welcome and looked after.
The location is great - very close to Temple Bar area. Would happily recommend to anyone going to Dublin"
5665724,490908391,7/19/2019,Very handy for the city centre and comfortable
5665724,494530615,7/24/2019,"Great space, great generous breakfasts & lively personalities.
Close to a bus stop & tram.
Very helpful with local tips & suggestions.
Only a double bed so a little small but still manageable & comfy."
5665724,502214213,8/4/2019,"James is a thoughtful, meticulous host. Everything works smoothly and our entire experience was lovely. Cannot recommend highly enough."
5665724,505318091,8/9/2019,Nice appartement at 15-20min from Temple Bar. Breakfast ok.
5665724,513979395,8/20/2019,"James was an literal life saver for us. We booked another Airbnb, which let us down on the day I flew to Dublin. James answered my call for help as fast as lightning and invited us to stay with him. Thank you again for saving us that day!!

If you want to have an great time in Dublin, with a place to come home to and relax, choose this apartment! James and Alan will have everything ready for you, including a yummi breakfast! They are wonderful and kind people and great hosts!"
5665724,522488085,9/2/2019,"James's home is absolutely beautiful, but also really welcoming and cosy. There are some great touches for guests such as a breakfast bar laid out with a continental breakfast, including delicious scones from the cafe downstairs, and a map of interesting places to visit. The location is fantastic as well, just 10 - 15 minutes walk from shopping on Parnell and O'Connell Streets. Don't forget to visit Jay's Cafe on the ground floor of the building for delicious food and a really warm welcome."
5665724,524168874,9/5/2019,We had a great time staying at James's place.  It was very clean and had lots of charm.  The apartment is a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  Very convenient!
5665724,536805975,9/27/2019,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jimmys place. Such a beautiful home located in a quiet street but easily accessible from the city centre. Although James was out of town, I received the warmest hospitality from his housemate Alan who was just an amazing person. Its a huge house but I never felt like I was away from home. Having being on my own for about two weeks it sure felt nice to just unwind and chill. 
Thanks for stocking up the fridge. 
PS: I never needed lunch after the breakfast that was provided."
5665724,546043359,10/13/2019,"James' location is absolutely wonderful. It's in a great location that is just a 12 or so minute walk from the city center, making sightseeing all major sights a breeze. Plus, it's not everyday you have the opportunity to stay in a period home--much less one with modernized amenities that still retain its original charm. James has used his sharp expertise as an architect to turn his space into an amazing place to stay.

There were many touches that made us feel all the more welcome, including a personalized print-out containing information about our stay, and a self-made guide that shows his local recommendations. For us, he left out some basic provisions we could use to make our own breakfast, but there is also a great cafe connected downstairs. Highly recommended!"
5665724,555836696,10/28/2019,"I had high expectations coming in because of all of the sparkling reviews, but I can with confidence say the stay exceeded those expectations. Do not hesitate to book here.

Make it a point to get Jays to-do list and check as many of the spots as you can, and also take advantage of Jays cafe being downstairs for your morning coffee or afternoon pick-me-up. Great location, and everything more or less is within walking distance. We didnt use transport at all. Cheers!"
5665724,563618116,11/13/2019,"The location of the accomodation was perfect, James was really kind and helpful:)"
5665724,565313111,11/17/2019,"Our stay at James's place was amazing! The house is in a quiet but central road, really close to the LUAS green line and to the city centre itself (about 10 min walking). There is also a nice bar just next to the main door; the owner is super nice and gave us tips for our stay. The room was super clean and endowed with everything one needs. Although we met James quickly only on our arrival, he provided us with really interesting suggestions for things to do in Dublin. Overall, we had a really pleasant experience at James's place, and we would definitely recommend his place to other travellers!"
5671611,419592883,3/4/2019,A great place in a great location!  Very clean and lacked nothing!  Worth it!

5671611,433968319,4/7/2019,"Simons house is beautifully decorated and a pleasure to stay in! Would definitely recommend it! A perfect distance from the centre to allow you to experience the real Dublin but also easily access all of the tourist attractions. Simon is a great host and was very responsive, getting someone over to help us when we struggled with the oven straight away. Thank you!"
5671611,437061155,4/14/2019,"The flat was very clean, comfortable and a great place to stay as we explored Dublin. Simon is super responsive and offered good suggestions and recommendations."
5671611,440857067,4/21/2019,"My friends and I stayed and Simons for my partners 30th. We all had a wonderful time. There was 10 of us all together, the house was spacious enough for us all not to be on top of each other and the amenities were wonderful. Simon was very helpful in the run up to the trip and communication whilst we were there was perfect. Location was amazing surrounding area being quiet with only short walk into the city centre. Would highly recommend!!"
5671611,445511520,4/29/2019,"Simon's place is as beautiful as on the pictures. We felt at home immadietely. We were a group of 7 people and it was enough space for everybody. The big table in the citchen especially was great for breakfast and evening drinks. Simon replied directly when we had any concern.

The house is located in a very nice area with a spar around the corner and nice pubs in walking distance.

It was the perfect choice for our weekend family trip!

Thank you again Simon :)"
5671611,446818479,5/2/2019,Simon's place is in a quiet residential area close to the city centre. Check in was smooth and swift and Simon provided us a lot of local tips. We had a wonderful stay in Dublin

We will definitely be back to another of Simon's places."
5671611,469309661,6/14/2019,This Airbnb was awesome. Lovely flat....
5671611,473788588,6/22/2019,"Great home!!  We have been to Dublin 6 times, and this home is one of the nicest that we have ever stayed in.  It is north of the Liffey, in an area that is less touristy.  There are many great pubs within walking distance.  We walked through the market area which had a lot of fruit and produce stands.  There is also a butcher shop that sells fresh meat and fish.  The large kitchen at the home is perfect if you want to make something at home!!"
5671611,478715906,6/30/2019,This a a great house for a group and is a beautiful home from home.

5671611,483022807,7/7/2019,Simons home was absolutely lovely - a large space for 8 of us to stay in with plenty of room. Simon was very quick to respond to any queries we had and gave some useful information about the surrounding area.
5671611,489730762,7/17/2019,"The house is so wonderful! We felt at home and comfortable immediately. The house is located within walking distance from many restaurants, take away locations, convenience stores, and the temple bar area (1 mile or so). We greatly enjoyed our time with our family of 8 (including a 6yo and 2yo)."
5671611,494349349,7/24/2019,"The apartment and its location was perfect for our party of 10 persons.  Simon was a fantastic host, who contributed with suggestions and advice for Dublin, and he was even generous enough to let us store our small mountain of luggage, includning sleeping bags, rain gear and a gigantic ¬´lavvu¬ª (Lappish teepee) in the apartment after checkout because of our late flight home. Thank you very much from all of us:  Family Norlund and family Matte Landgraff"
5671611,508075741,8/12/2019,This place is exactly as it looks on the site.  It is lovely and quiet and it is centrally located for your daily excursions around Dublin.  The kitchen provided a great place for us all to gather and talk about day!
5671611,509908884,8/15/2019,"Great home: Clean, lots of space, awesome kitchen, comfortable beds and great bathrooms! Very quiet neighborhood for sleeping after long day of international travel. Fabi was great - she showed us the house and was very welcoming on our first day to Ireland. The only thing we would advise is taking an Uber/Taxi to/from town especially with children."
5671611,511218142,8/17/2019,"Fantastic home, in a great location, with thoughtful hosts!"
5671611,516288931,8/24/2019,"Good clean home beautifully furnished. However, the locality seemed a bit shady and  away from all the good restaurants/pubs which are around the city centre."
5671611,536327792,9/26/2019,I loved staying at Simons house.  He was very easy to communicate with.  The house had so many small conveniences and touches that made staying there lovely.  We cooked quite a bit and the kitchen had everything we needed. This was also a very great place to stay with kids. We often walked to the park and Simon had a crib and a high chair which was super helpful.  We did puzzles in the kitchen and everyone looked forward to coming back at the end of a big day.
5671611,542246176,10/6/2019,Simon's place is a fantastic choice. It's about a 15 minute walk into the centre so great location. The house was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed. Simon and our allocated house manager were quick to respond to any questions we had. Would definitely recommend for a group weekend in Dublin.
5671611,548322928,10/17/2019,This was a wonderful home a quick walk from all the great downtown areas in Dublin. The host was over the top helpful to us with excellent tips that made our stay wonderful. Might be our best stay yet at an air bnb.   We would love to visit again.
5671611,562010807,11/10/2019,"Simon's home is awesome! There were nine of us here for the weekend celebrating a birthday and meeting up with old friends! There was plenty of space and it felt very homey! The house was clean and ready for us when we arrived! Simon also worked with us so we could check in early because of our early flight! The house is about a 25-30 min walk from the Temple Bar area, but only 10 minutes by cab! Every major spot is about a 5 to 10 minute cab ride! Amazing stay! Thank you!"
5671611,565354537,11/17/2019,"Simons house was a great home away from home for our girls weekend. Gorgeous house, and great area for nice breakfast places / close to city. Would definitely recommend"
5671611,568320955,11/24/2019,The apartment is beautiful and in a nice neighbourhood. Walking distance from the city center if you're not lazy. Simon gave us plenty of information to get around and made sure we had everything we needed. Recommended.
5696906,422530183,3/11/2019,"Mary is a great host - chatty, caring, and a charming person as well! The house is really cozy and gives you a feeling you live at home, bedrooms are good and there was never a problem with a bathroom, even though there were several people staying at the house at the same time. Check-in and check out are super easy too!

The area is very nice as well, with many nice restaurants and shops and a trip to a city center is very fast and convenient with a tram. Would highly recommend and would stay again for sure! Thanks Mary for a great stay!"
5696906,425525165,3/18/2019,"The room is ok and the heater work very well, the bathroom is big with shower. In the kitchen there are fruits and if you want you can prepare coffee and tea. The apartment is in a quiet zone so you can sleep without any problems, but there are pubs and restaurant around. Grafton Street is about 15-20 minutes walk so you can have a nice walk, the bus stop from airport is less than 10 minutes walk. I just saw Mary in the evening when i arrived but she was always ready to reply my questions while i was there, so she is the perfect host. The self check-in is very easy so i could arrive to apartment at 11pm and i didn't have any problem for the check-in, the last day she allow me to leave the apartment in first afternoon. It's a great place to stay. Thanks Mary!!!"
5696906,428515467,3/25/2019,"I felt very comfortable during my stay in Mary's house. She is a very helpful, friendly Host. It is very central and you can discover a lot in the neighborhood. The room was bright and nice. I highly recommend her House"
5696906,437245891,4/14/2019,"Cant beat Ranelagh for closeness to Dublin and a wonderful village atmosphere. Everything you need is within steps.  The #1 room I stayed in was on the small side, but the bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom down a few steps was spotless!!  Mary is a lovely host - I only saw her once or twice but she seems kind.  

Buy a Leap card at the SPAR (sp?) and dont forget to touch the pad when you enter and exit the tram.
Takes you into downtown Dublin in under 10 minutes!

Enjoyed this hone and would stay again : )"
5696906,451954685,5/12/2019,"Amazing location, room, and stay. I would definitely recommend!"
5696906,458048577,5/25/2019,"Mary is a great host and the place is very clean, cosy and also located just a short walk from the city centre."
5696906,460103491,5/28/2019,"The house is very close to the city which is easily accessible by either foot, bus or taxi. Mary is also very helpful and will provide any tips and also mentions some information on a welcoming sheet when you arrive."
5696906,463887834,6/4/2019,"Fantastic location,beautiful property and a welcoming host!"
5696906,466535578,6/9/2019,The room in Marys house is very clean and the bed sleeps great. You can easy acces the house with a code and own keys. Mary reacts very fast on questions. The house is in a nice area with supermarkets and restaurants. With the green Leap youre very fast in the City Centre.
5696906,470628839,6/16/2019,Mary's place is wonderful.  It is in a central location with plenty of places to eat within walking distance.  The room was clean and in order.  The bathroom was clean as well and decorated nicely.  Check in was no problem at all.  My overall experience was fantastic and I would recommend anyone who decides to travel to Dublin to stay at Mary's place.
5696906,472351884,6/19/2019,"This place is in a great location and buses and luas are close by.  It has a nice village atmosphere with good restaurants and food shops and is very quiet.  Mary was very helpful with directions and orientation.  I thought I'd be sharing a bath with one other person but there were 3 others and no hand washing (important to me as it was the end of my trip).  A yoga studio is at the back of the house with classes in late afternoon, so voices and footsteps were not expected."
5696906,474431142,6/23/2019,"Mary was both communicative, prompt, and a wonderful host. While she was not able to welcome me into the residence, she did however send me prompt communications via the messaging app to ensure I not only arrived, but got all situated. 

This is a very conveniently located residence next to many local pubs and the tram that takes you into downtown. The only downside was the fact that the public transit closed at midnight, but that's no fault of Mary's. 

My stay here was extremely pleasant and I would recommend her hands-down!"
5696906,477976579,6/29/2019,This is a really well located place in Dublin. It is very convenient to get into the city by bus or tram. It is a very quiet room and the bed is comfortable. I enjoyed my time staying at Mary's place.
5696906,481120494,7/4/2019,"The stay at Marys was a lovely experiance. Firstly the check-in was a breeze; the instructions provided were accurate and to the point. The room was comfortable and cozy and perfect to come back to after a long day. The place was sparkling clean and maintained. Though Mary was not there, instructions and house rules were clearly provided and she was always available on call or message incase required. The house location is also very convenient with grocery shops, pharmacy, restaurants nearby; the tram stop is also a few steps away and the city center is only a few minutes on the tram. Highly recommended."
5696906,485668636,7/11/2019,Clean and to spec. Superb.
5696906,491629537,7/20/2019,It is a very nice location and easy to get to the city Centre. The bed is very comfy and everything was clean!
5696906,498710872,7/30/2019,Marys place is beautiful and roomy! i had the comfiest bed and coziest room. theres so many places to eat right outside her door and the bus stop is right across the street. very convenient ! The only thing I wasnt thrilled about was the 10:30pm shower deadline. Other than that everything was perfect! Shes very flexible with check in/out times too. Thank you mary!
5696906,508105162,8/12/2019,"The room was better than expected, clean, good wifi and a big and confortable bed. I did a late check-in due to my flight being delayed and there was no issue.
There is a good italian restartant Antica Veneziaù literally 5 meters from the door and few other places on the main street. City center is 30 min away by walk."
5696906,521631734,9/1/2019,"Pros:
- Excellent location. The house is within the heat of Ranelagh village. Bus stop right outside and LUAS within walking distance 
- Great food around, and if you are looking for a long term stay, there are grocery stores around as well 
- The house itself has been tastefully done, its beautiful, quiet and peaceful 
- Kitchen available for use 
- Great bed with very cozy comforter 

Cons: 
- The exhaust of the property behind is quite noisy, so if you are light sleeper and keeping the window open, you may be disturbed
- If its a hot day, theres no fan or cooling system in place in the room, so the room can get hot 
- The water pump can get noisy, but showers are not allowed past 1030 pm, so shouldnt be an issue"
5696906,525216971,9/7/2019,The owner is very nice and the house is very clean and comfortable. The location is very close to the city centre. Highly recommend.
5696906,529836625,9/15/2019,"Mary's place is gorgeous, full of life, in the heart of Ranelagh and close to everything... The room and bed are very comfy and it's probably one of the best values in the City. Hat's off Mary!"
5696906,532241783,9/19/2019,Great
5696906,533965073,9/22/2019,very nice place to stay and very nice bed thanks
5696906,536639291,9/27/2019,A charming room in a lively neighborhood. Its a quick walk or tram ride to town. A great way to experience Dublin.
5696906,542413641,10/6/2019,"Great value in expensive Dublin. Lovely area and Marys place is steps away from cafes, pubs, restaurants and buses and trams. Warm comfortable place and Mary is so hospitable. I had a problem with my luggage and she drove me to the repairers to get it fixed. So lovely."
5696906,544477665,10/10/2019,"My stay at Mary's house was lovely and relaxing. Really comfy bed and soft sheets. Mary was on holiday while I was there but she replied to emails very quickly. The house had a lovely feel to it and is in a great location, near the LUAS, Aircoach and walking distance to the centre. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby too. Would highly recommend staying here."
5696906,546923095,10/14/2019,"Thanks Mary for having me for the weekend! The space is clean and you will feel you have some privacy too. The room was also warm and not too noisy, I think its great for short stays."
5696906,553132910,10/23/2019,"Mary is welcoming and friendly, the location is central and my bed was very comfy. All good."
5696906,555101767,10/27/2019,"Marys place was as advertised, comfortable, and easily accessible. The bed in the room was extremely comfortable, and I felt safe in the neighborhood and close to some great places to eat in the village. I highly recommend staying with Mary!"
5696906,565976702,11/18/2019,"Second stay at Mary's place and I can only repeat myself: it's a pure gem in a preserved area, not far from City center, cozy and comfy, so what's not to like?!!!"
5699798,428532279,3/25/2019,Very nice apartment and location. Adrian is a very knowledgable host. We enjoyed our stay!
5699798,431036819,3/31/2019,"Really well located, walkable to the central attractions in Dublin, trouble-free and great communication from Adrian. Top value."
5699798,433997788,4/7/2019,Good location! Adrian is a nice host who can tell you everything about the city.
5699798,440209091,4/20/2019,Unfortunately the stay was terrible and we cannot recommend the apartment to anyone. Cleanliness of the flat was so terrible that Airbnb moved us into a hotel - I think that's everything one needs to know.
5699798,445509548,4/29/2019,"Nice Appartment. We could get in early in the morning, and leave in the afternoon. Thank you."
5699798,448566975,5/5/2019,Great apartment in central location. Highly recommend....
5699798,451929825,5/12/2019,Great stay in Adrians. Adrian was very speedy in response and had a lot details available for things to do during the day
5699798,455784237,5/20/2019,Adrian is a realy nice guy. Communication is perfect with him and the apartment is cute. If you looking for a quite place to stay for a few days than it's a good choice.
5699798,462533670,6/2/2019,"Location is quiet but within a 10 min walk of almost everything, which is great. Communication was quick and meeting for checkin was simple. The lock on the door is a bit tricky but after a few times it gets easier to figure out."
5699798,463958925,6/4/2019,"Very accommodating host with excellent communications. Location was perfect for us, really enjoyed some of the local bars and cafes very close by. Easy walk to other bars, restaurants and shopping areas."
5699798,467271759,6/10/2019,Adrian was kind enough to give us some really useful recommendations while we checked in and the apartment's location is great (very close to St Patrick's Cathedral in particular and everything is walking distance).
5699798,470663930,6/16/2019,"Adrian is an outstanding host - very accommodating and communicative; he even allowed an early check-in since we were coming into Dublin on a red eye.

The space was very cozy and comfortable and made a perfect base from which to explore Dublin."
5699798,473847562,6/22/2019,Great location!! Perfect for walkable access to all that City Center has to offer and Adrian was a great host!!
5699798,475538743,6/24/2019,Adrian was a great host; our flight got in late and he was very accommodating with waiting up for us to arrive and showing us around the place as well as giving great tips on the area and leaving a large amount of brochures around to make sure we made the most of our time in Dublin. Would recommend to everybody!
5699798,478037939,6/29/2019,We had a great stay at Adrians place in Dublin. His place is cozy and very convenient for traveling. It is a very easy walk to the city Centre but is very quiet. Adrian provided the space with plenty of pamphlets and suggestions for local attractions. Thank you!
5699798,478990452,6/30/2019,"Adrian is an amazing host. He made it a priority to walk me around the apartment and confirm everything would work for me.  He also has tons of maps/local suggestions for the area.  The apartment is located within a 20-30 minute walk to just about everything in the city.  Overall, it was a great experience!"
5710121,421887287,3/10/2019,"House is cosy and good for family visit. Shower pressure needs attention, and also the shower water on the main bathroom, which gets either too hot or too cold. Overall it was ok. Wouldnt call this an Airbnb Plus thou."
5710121,423514735,3/14/2019,"Karen and her home is so wonderful! I stayed here with my mother, husband and 9yo daughter, who called the home a ""mini castle."" There are so many sweet antiques, yet it's very warm and cozy. The beds were incredibly comfortable - all of us had a hard time waking up in the morning, we were so cozy! 

Karen was super easy to communicate with, and accommodated our crazy-early arrival time with no hassle. The neighborhood is great, there are great shops and pubs around the corner, or it's a quick taxi ride into the central part of Dublin. We would definitely love to stay there again. Thanks Karen!"
5710121,425904301,3/19/2019,It was a beautiful journey to us. The house is amazing and so wonderfully arranged. The decoration is really great! Karen is a nice host. We spent a great time.
5710121,427822729,3/24/2019,"This is an absolutely wonderful home for your trip to Dublin! We were so very comfortable every moment. The kitchen has a nice island for gathering around. The beds are extremely comfortable. The home is impeccable in decor. And the best part was all the hospitality and local tips from Karen. She recommended several restaurants that turned out to be our favorites of the trip! We cannot thank her enough for hosting! 

Also, all the cab drivers and tour hosts we spoke with mentioned what a poshù area this AirBNB is ... we felt safe the entire trip and loved the neighborhood! There is a grocery and loads of yummy restaurants all within walking distance. 

Highly recommend staying here and plan to again next time we visit Ireland!"
5710121,430308206,3/30/2019,"What a gorgeous house and in a fantastic location!  Karen was a wonderful host, very flexible and helpful.  The house was delightful, with lovely antique finishes but modern conveniences like plentiful hot water, dishwasher etc.  It was a pleasant walk into the centre of Dublin, we enjoyed the exercise and also appreciated the pleasant neighbourhood and the perfect silence at night.  The beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable, the kitchen was beautifully appointed with everything you might need, and there were great shops and restaurants nearby.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay in Dublin and the house was perfect for our group of 6 (including one senior citizen and three teenagers).  Many thanks Karen for all your hospitality!"
5710121,433975098,4/7/2019,"Karen has been the best host from North and South Americas and to Asia, I have done my fortunate bit of travel. Stayed with some pretty rough and great places in my travels but this place is a dream. Thank you Karen for sharing your incredible home with the 6 of us!
Slainte!"
5710121,438288208,4/16/2019,"We had 3 generations staying in Karens home and everyone enjoyed it. The sitting areas are beautiful for a cup of tea/coffee in the morning and the blackout shades are a big perk in the rooms. The place is so stylish, we snapped many photos before moving all of our stuff in to remember it! LOVE the neighborhood"
5710121,441696240,4/22/2019,Karen is a great host and the house was perfect for our needs.
5710121,444826251,4/28/2019,"Had a lovely weekend at Karens house. She was a great host and the house is very very spacious, with Uber comfortable beds.
The location was about 20 mins away from most of the main parts of town, close enough to the action but  far away enough for a quiet night.
Thank you Karen!"
5710121,449230219,5/6/2019,"Karen's place is lovely.   It's super convenient to town,  while being a real Dublin home!"
5710121,454982961,5/19/2019,We loved staying in Karens beautiful home. It is not only pleasing to the eye but also extremely comfortable. Our party of 6 loved the convenient location and enjoyed visiting with our hostess and her friendly dogs on the first day. She left food for us and made us feel very welcome. If we return to Ireland we want to stay again.
5710121,458770685,5/26/2019,"Karen was a wonderful host - attentive and always in touch.  To give you a sense of the type of person she is - upon checking out, we forgot our sons diaper bag at her home. I messaged Karen and after a few exchanges, she was nice enough to drive the bag to our next location. 

In addition to Karens welcoming nature, her home was lovely and within walking distance of the town. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to spend some time in Ireland."
5710121,465776610,6/8/2019,Karen is a wonderful host!! She is very friendly and happy to help with any special requests. She had bread and milk waiting for us when we checked in which was really nice! Overall we had a great stay at her home. The only negative thing I can mention is that we thought we were going to be closer to the city center of Dublin. It cost around 18-25 euros each way every time we wanted to taxi to town. Other than that the stay was wonderful! Very comfortable beds!!
5710121,473862035,6/22/2019,Everything was as advertised. Our group would stay there again.
5710121,477519397,6/28/2019,"What a lovely home! Fabulous modern amenities housed in a charming Irish row home. Karen was fabulous. She went well beyond what is usually expected to provide us with a warm and welcoming stay. Be mindful of parking, as it is along the length of the street. Finding a spot can be difficult later at night, but we generally were able to find something. 
We cant thank you enough Karen. We enjoyed your wonderful home, and our stay in Dublin."
5710121,483177218,7/7/2019,We loved staying at Karens! Beautiful home & lovely service!
5710121,498748251,7/30/2019,Beautiful Irish home with lovely outside space to relax.
5710121,508188721,8/12/2019,The house was wonderful and Karen is a magnificent host.  I highly recommend.
5710121,517286494,8/25/2019,"A really nice home in a great part of town.  We were particularly impressed with the interior decorating - the home had a classic feel but with modern amenities and appliances.  

Our host Karen was also very responsive to any of our questions and helped us navigate the city.

Overall, we had a positive experience."
5710121,519246193,8/28/2019,"Lovely, lovely home, beautiful details, very comfortable. Easy to make food and enjoy our group together - a very nice stay."
5710121,525247440,9/7/2019,"A home lovingly decorated with character and style, adorned with books and memorabilia from bygone times - great for a family getaway and the perfect setting for high tea! Karen is a very conscientious host and is on hand to help you with your every need as shes just a stones throw away in the little house at the back. The milk, coffee, fresh bread, butter and preserves was a really lovely touch. Please note: the 4th bedroom is not ideal for really tall people, as it is in the attic and has limited head room, but it does have a very cute en-suite bathroom and is beautifully decorated."
5710121,534167410,9/22/2019,"Karens home is warm and lovely. It is an old house full of character. As a host, she is very involved. She will walk you through every little detail at check-in, she is always available via text, and she has her neighbors watch over the house while guests are staying there. There are many strict house rules, and Karen is vigilant about adherence to those rules. Amenities are good, and so is the location. The listing is pretty accurate. Altogether, we were pleased."
5710121,546180697,10/13/2019,"Karen's place was fabulous! The home is full of character. It accommodated four single adults easily and gave each our own space.  The house became an sanctuary of relaxation. If we hadn't been sightseeing, I could easily have just relaxed in this home reading a book with a glass of wine in the salon, coffee in the morning on the patio, etc.  Public transportation was nearby; however, we used taxis to get about town. There is street parking on a narrow avenue but it was plentiful. Karen was a pleasure to communicate with. Communication was easy and quick. Karen met us at the home upon check in; very easy to chat with and informative.  I would not hesitate to stay here again on my return to Dublin."
5710121,551308106,10/20/2019,Karen's house was an easy choice when we were looking for a place and lived up to the billing. It was full of character and comfort.
5710121,556427200,10/29/2019,"Karens beautiful home is in the absolute best location! We loved being walking distance to downtown Dublin, to the Luas, to groceries, and neighborhood parks. Plus, the neighborhood is beautiful. Karens home is gorgeous, and very thoughtfully designed. This home was our final stay after a month in Ireland, and it was so lovely to still have the outdoor space while in the city. And, the beds are so cozy! Karen was an absolutely wonderful host. She met us upon check in, was quick to respond to any need, and very gracious and helpful when our one year old became ill. Her neighborhood recommendations are spot on. 

Only two small issues for us. A washer and dryer are listed, but they were not actually accessible to guests. This was an issue since we were on a longer trip, and planned to use them at each home we booked. And, the home is listed as family friendly, but there were small ceramics or glass objects on every surface in every room which was difficult with two small children. Like I stated, small issues, but important to note for families. 

Overall, a wonderful stay with a very gracious host, and superb location!"
5710121,558906455,11/3/2019,"Karens house is so beautifully designed, down to the very smallest detail. We had such a lovely time staying there, and would recommend it to anyone."
5710121,565384640,11/17/2019,"Beautiful house with very comfortable amenities. Karen was a wonderfully welcoming host. 

Point of note for future guests: as is the nature of such a lovely period house with high ceilings, it takes a while for the house to heat up so we turned up the heating earlier rather than waiting until it was cold. The heating is very easy to use though so this isn't a problem at all and once we realised this we had a very comfortable and lovely stay."
5712832,444816450,4/28/2019,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here on our 5 night stay in Dublin. It was a perfect size for two of us and super cozy! The location is great - super close to a lot of top tourist attractions. For the spots not so close, there are taxis just outside along with multiple bus stops that will bring you everywhere else. We availed of the airport pick-up/drop-off and had some confusion with not being able to find the driver, however we got quick responses and everyone was very friendly in helping :) overall we loved our stay and I would highly recommend!"
5712832,467512560,6/10/2019,"Great location, great value. Would recommend to others"
5712832,481610092,7/5/2019,"A great location, great place with tons to do and a short walk to most of the cities best sights. I'd recommend anyone looking to take in both the relaxing side and nightlife of Dublin stay here, since you stay right in the heart of it all."
5712832,487647991,7/14/2019,Good little 2nd floor apartment for 4 - 6 people. Has everything that you need. Brilliant location
5712832,525053445,9/7/2019,"Nice flat, the location is perfect for all activities downtown. We expected more noise during the night, but it was very quiet."
5736480,422564463,3/11/2019,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in Dublin. Located 15 minutes by car from the city center (30 minutes by public transit) and about 30 minutes from the airport it was very accessible to get to the things we had planned. However, the front entrance was gated and we had to walk up a hill with our luggage - which was fine for us, but may not be for others. We loved being able to relax on the balcony with a cuppa in the mornings and sit cozied up next to the fireplace in the evening."
5736480,426237845,3/20/2019,"This flat is a perfect location for easy day trips into Dublin via bus route while avoiding the craziness of the city.  Chapelizod has some wonderful pubs/restaurants/shops with a small town feel while being just outside Dublin.  As for the flat itself, the character of old wood floors and fireplace are timeless; however, the listing pictures are outdated and several furnishings have been changed since it was listed.  The space is almost overrun with the hosts personal belongings, making it difficult for guests to settle in and find necessary items (hairdryer, hangers or space to hang clothes, etc).  Other than that, the location and space are a great value."
5736480,435074907,4/9/2019,"Maeve,s place was great , very stylish and private. The parking was convenient and the location was ideal for us. 15$ taxi or 3$ bus to city center. The little pubs and restaurants right down the street were excellent. Would stay again!"
5736480,437205917,4/14/2019,"We stayed at Maeve's for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. Since we travelled by car it was great not having any problems finding a parking space (since it is a gated community with a parking lot). Especially since parking in and near to Dublin is quite a struggle and can be verx expensive. The bus ride into the city centre was easy and quick and it also took us only about half an hour to get to the Wicklow mountains. The flat itself was great and very homey, though there were some differences to what is shown in the pictures (regarding furniture)."
5736480,440898421,4/21/2019,Maeve was an efficient and quick host! She explains her home very well and accurately. Thanks for your hospitality! Felt like staying at a friend's place.
5736480,442888205,4/24/2019,The host canceled this reservation 42 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5736480,449675616,5/7/2019,"This place was in a great location. Very clean and stylish. Wooden floors with a fireplace and balcony, was by far one of the best places I've ever stayed."
5736480,463409404,6/3/2019,"We stayed in Maeve's apartment while attending the Bloom Show in Phoenix Park. Perfect location, great views from balcony, quiet area. Shops etc all close by.  We used self check in and Meave was available for any queries etc . . . Highly recommend - would stay again!!"
5736480,470431665,6/16/2019,"The place was lovely, stylish and in a great little village. Only downside was the host had left lots of her belongings, so not ideal if you need lots of wardrobe space, however it was enough for us for the weekend."
5736480,484599798,7/9/2019,"Great location for sight seeing in Dublin and further afield, with buses running incredibly frequently, even on Sundays.  Having access to Phoenix Park was a bonus, and seeing the many deer that live there made it very special.
The apartment has everything you would need for a very comfortable stay, including a delightful balcony with beautiful views.
Maeve is really lovely and was very helpful with many excellent recommendations.
All in all, our stay couldn't have been better.     :-))"
5736480,526640345,9/9/2019,This place is a real gem. The moment I opened the front door I felt a sense of calm and peace. The location is beautiful - I am so glad we chose to stay just outside the City Centre as it meant we had the best of both worlds. Maeves flat is really comfortable and homely. The balcony is just lovely - in the morning there is a lovely view over the river. But the real plus is the secret gate to Phoenix Park which is such a beautiful place.  We spent a whole day exploring the park and watching the deer. There is also a fantastic cafe in the village where I had the best avocado toast ever. It is very easy to get into the City Centre - buses every few minutes just a few minutes walk away.  I would highly recommend Maeves place and I am so glad we chose it.
5736480,554950914,10/27/2019,"Maeve is a kind and caring host. Her place is very cozy, there is a small supermarket, a very nice restaurant (The Bridge), and a bus stop nearby, all within walking distance!  Heuston station is 5 minutes away (get a Leap Card). If you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, and experience a village feel, pick this place. Highly recommended!"
5736480,563841774,11/14/2019,Great little apartment. The lovely Chapelizod village is nearby and you are only a short bus journey from Dublin City centre. Being within walking distance of Phoenix Park is a bonus. The apartment itself is ideal for one person or a couple: cosy and perfectly proportioned. Thanks Maeve for your hospitality and communication!

5790359,514948852,8/22/2019,"Beautiful home in a gorgeous setting.  A 3-minute walk to the beach!  New neighborhood and quiet.  Beds are comfortable.
Be aware that this home is very lived in and the host's belongings are in every room, giving us a feeling that we were intruding in their home and that they were going to drop in at any time.  Had we known this in advance we would have been prepared.  Also,  for non-European travelers, educate yourselves on what a wet room is and how to turn on the water heaters as well as heating for the home.  (This applies to homes in general in the UK) Be aware that the water heater in this home will not accommodate consecutive showers.  You must wait about 20-30 minutes in between showers.  We made the reservation for this Airbnb with 5 of us staying here  so the host was aware of that.    After the 3rd shower there was NO hot water as the water heater failed.   Upon contacting the owner we were told we were supposed to wait for 20 minutes in between showers."
5790359,521115267,8/31/2019,Carol was quick to respond to any and all questions we had and was very polite in all communication. The house itself was very nice and clean and had all the amenities listed in the posting. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Ireland.
5790359,525725820,9/8/2019,"Caroo has a lovely house, only 15-20mims walk to Skerries harbour. She was constantly in touch about our visit, and I would recommend her house to anyone that wants to stay in the area."
5790524,437901955,4/15/2019,"Staying at Carols place was the best choice by chance we could have made. After traveling around through Irland and sleeping in B&Bs mostly, we enjoyed staying in this cosy and nicely decorated house, which is situated close to the sea. carol is really fun to talk to and great company - we didnt  feel as guests, more like friends in the end - but you have to be cool people ;) we surely come back!!!"

5790524,543776252,10/8/2019,"Very nice house in a quiet neighbourhood. The room is lovely and the bed very very comfortable. Carol's hospitality was great, she is very caring and even cooked for me a few times. It's a 20min walk to the next train station and it takes another 30min to Dublin, which is easy to handle if you plan your day a bit. Mind that there are no trains/buses past 11.30pm.
I'd recommend this accommodation."
5835782,434688502,4/8/2019,It is super tidy and clean accommodation. Karen is very kind and considerate. I absolutely enjoyed my stay there including the great morning walk alongside the beach(right in front of the house!).

5835782,451865217,5/12/2019,"Karen's gorgeous home in Sandymount is everything the visiting professional or recreational visitor to Dublin would want. The home is the warmest I visited while visiting Dublin, the bed super comfortable. The decor is modern and tasteful; everything issuper clean, every nuanced detail thoughtfully attended to. There are some house rules that make it better for everyone including other guests and hosts. In a gated community on glorious Sandymount strand, it does not get much better. A super quiet but close enough to the centre of Dublin. Sandymount village is a treat with a couple of cute coffee shops on a sweet village green."

5835782,471835936,6/18/2019,"There are so many Dos and Don'ts and Rules to this accomodation that I wouldn't recommend it for a holiday stay, just if you need a bed for a work trip. Important to be aware that there is no access to any other room in the house except the bedroom and bathroom. Otherwise place is clean and comfortable."

The flat itself is perfect for the traveling couple. Light and airy, the flat has a small balcony overlooking the courtyard of the apartment building. We had lovely weather and kept the window and door to the balcony the whole time we were in the apartment (albeit not that long!).  Joseph (Gemmas brother-in-law) greeted us and he couldnt have been nicer and more informative. He had excellent directions and recommendations. 
A last note for all those white-sound sleepers, Gemma provides a fan in the bedroom which is a great touch, personally speaking. Loved our stay with Gemma and will definitely recommend."
5887650,475996156,6/25/2019,"Amazing location! Close to temple bar area, city centre and Guinness factory. Josef was very welcoming and gave us lots of tips for where to go."
5887650,478925464,6/30/2019,Lovely apartment the edge of the city centre. 5 minute walk from the Guinness storehouse
5887650,561373447,11/9/2019,My stay was pleasant. Communication was easy and fast. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Good place to stay when staying in Dublin!
5887717,464769575,6/6/2019,Good
5887717,466405274,6/9/2019,"Joe's apartment has great location! Our bus arrived just few blocks away and airport bus stops also very near. The center is within easy walking distance, yet the area is peaceful. The building is modern and quite. The apartment was perhaps just a little bit worn, which didn't bother us. Sofa-bed in the living room area was also good to sleep on. We were able to check in early, which was really helpful. Communication was good. Thanks Joe!"
5887717,468859409,6/13/2019,Totally fine place to stay for a night or two. Joe was very quick to respond and helpful.
5887717,469713701,6/15/2019,"Location great for walking into town and a quick 20 min taxi ride from the airport, close to a small supermarket too. Price was good in relation to the rest of Dublin. Thats where the positives ended for us Im afraid, for us it was really disappointing and my family were quite upset with the condition of the apartment having seen the advert look so lovely. 

The apartment is very grubby, a lot of things are broken/cracked/stained. The towels and bedding we were given were stained and threads were hanging off them. Theres basic amenities missing such as spare towels, tea dowels, dish cloth, TV etc, it was very basic. 

I aired my feedback to the host who wasnt very receptive to my constructive comments even when I provided photos - his response was to sarcastically imply I was the problem because I had had difficulty the previous day in finding the apartment (totally irrelevant to the condition of the apartment but hey). The description of how to find the building, although lengthy, was inaccurate (we were told it was opposite a tyre shop but there are no tyre shops or even garages opposite). 

I was provided 2 phone numbers to contact when I arrived in Dublin, the primary number wouldnt answer and the second number sounded completely confused and unaware of why I was calling which was very worrying. This person then gave me a third contact number to call, of a girl who was cleaning the apartment. She didnt say anything to us when we walked up, didnt show us how/where to use the fob, literally walked us into the flat, handed me a towel and left. We stood in absolute amazement. 

I appreciate the hosts comments that this is a home not a hotel so cant be expected to meet the same standards but in my view, if youre willing to rent out a property on Air BnB, its not unreasonable to expect cleanliness as minimum. In addition, we stayed in another Air BnB (again in someones home) the 3 nights prior to our stay here and it was absolutely perfect so I cant accept that its a home is a valid excuse. 

Lastly, the pictures imply that the apartment is in/overlooking the college (numerous people had said this when looking at the advert without me saying) and it isnt, its about a 5 minute walk away and overlooks building sites which cant be helped. However, I think the pictures give a false representation. 

I wasnt going to write a review but the response I had from the host this morning really took me aback and prompted me to write an honest review for future potential guests. 

In summary, if youre a young student who is not particularly concerned about cleanliness and nice presentation, this would probably be fine for you. If youre a family/friends/couple and you wanted a nice base for a few days away, I wouldnt recommend this apartment."
5887717,471773315,6/18/2019,"Joe is an excellent host! His apartment is in a great location for going on local tours and seeing everything Dublin has to offer, but just far enough from the busy areas to have a wonderful stay. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is considering a visit to Dublin!"
5887717,473191077,6/21/2019,"The experience was amazing, the house is in a perfect area! With walk distance you go anywhere downtown. I suggest to everyone that considering a little vacation in Dublin, to stay at Joes place. Definitely we will back again if we decide to come back in Dublin"
5887717,474734978,6/23/2019,"Good place for a weekend break.. Good location and building felt secure.
Place is a little tired, but for a base to explore Dublin, can't complain!"
5887717,477025928,6/27/2019,"The apartment is pretty much exactly as described, and the photos are very accurate. The location is great, right next to trinity college, very near to temple bar. Its also really close to bus stops and a train station in case you need to travel to other areas in Dublin. The communication was excellent and check in/out went without issues. Highly recommended."
5887717,480774521,7/3/2019,"The flat is in an excellent location near Trinity College with all of central Dublin within walking distance, its an ideal base for a couple for a short break. The flat is a little tired but perfectly serviceable and although we didnt use it, has a very well stocked kitchen. Joe was a very responsive host, sorting issues quickly and offering recommendations. Great bakery for breakfast just round the corner too. Would stay again if in Dublin for a couple of nights."
5887717,481728140,7/5/2019,"Joes place is great! Its located very close to great restaurants and bars and only a 15 minute walk or so to popular areas like Temple Bar. Joe accommodated us when we requested an early check in and was quick to answer any of our questions. The cleaning staff met us when we were confused about how to enter the apartment and was lovely as well! This space is incredibly clean and quite roomy î complete with a great shower and bathroom, kitchen, super comfortable bed, and a balcony to relax and view the city from. I wish we would have stayed here longer!"
5887717,485771485,7/11/2019,A lovely apartment in the centre of Dublin. Spotlessly clean with absolutely everything you could think of.  I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Joe.
5887717,486148626,7/12/2019,Super convenient location. Incredibly quiet. Host communicated with us brilliantly and the place was spotless.  Best air b n b experience Ive had in Dublin.
5887717,491642109,7/20/2019,"At great value to money only a few minutes walk from Temple, i'd definitely recommend this as a good option as a base.  Our host was very quick to answer any questions and checkin / checkout was as easy as it could be."
5887717,496369771,7/27/2019,"I stayed at Joe's apartment for a week, Sunday through Saturday, July 2019, in order to attend a work conference at Trinity College, Dublin. The location, regardless of business or pleasure, is the heart of Dublin city. It is literally around the corner from Trinity (if that is your need) but every possible attraction or amenity a visitor to Dublin needs is on your doorstep. 
The apartment had two double beds (1 bedroom, with a fold out couch/bed - perfectly comfortable). The place was spotless, the kitchen has everything you need on hand, there was piping hot water on demand, fresh towels, spare clean (and new) bed linen, wifi was really good. There was literally nothing else I could need or look for. One or two email queries to Joe were answered instantly (including one late on Sunday night after check in - exceptional response).
With the price of Dublin hotels in peak summer there was no way I could stretch a week in Dublin for work and allow time to catch up with friends. 
I can't recommend the place highly enough! BOOK!"
5887717,498863200,7/30/2019,Joes flat was the perfect location and a great spot to get around the city from.
5887717,503731081,8/6/2019,Great location and accommodation. The system to get the key was a difficult hassle compared to most Airbnb experiences.
5887717,504232869,8/7/2019,The host canceled this reservation 86 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5887717,504871630,8/8/2019,"Joe thank you for being our host. While our stay at your apartment met our needs, there were issues. The washer/dryer didnt work the best and the clothes I did dry turned purple. Im not sure if this was due to the previous load by perhaps the previous tenant. The refrigerator/ freezer was unavailable which could have been a big inconvenience for someone staying longer than two days.

The construction right outside this apartment made for a very early morning even for a moderately heavy sleeper especially when working past moderate jet lag. Although you cannot help this aspect, I think it should be mentioned to potential renters when they query. 

Although it is definitely apparent that you and your keeper work hard to be attentive to the cleanliness of this apartment, there are some things might need to be replaced. Such as, the board under the shower. 

The apartment is very warm and stuffy when walking in, we had to air it out every time we came in. 

The location was very central and we loved that. We did not use the dishes or stove. 

Also when we went to empty the trash it was difficult to find the utility room as it was written on the first floor when in actuality it was on the ground floor past a few doorways. We looked throughout the entire complex until we found this.

All in all, this is a good stay for a quick trip in the city."
5887717,508176740,8/12/2019,Joe was easy to contact. He gave good instructions. His space was kept very clean however there was a very powerful cigarette smell
5887717,509330440,8/14/2019,"C'etait genial! Bonne localisation, apoartemment Beau et propre.

Grand merci pour l'accueil!"
5887717,514045002,8/20/2019,The location was great and communication was excellent.
5887717,515795363,8/23/2019,"Joes apartment is a fantastic place to stay while in Dublin! Taking the 747 bus from the airport to pick up the key was incredibly easy, as the bus stop is right in front of the pickup location. Its just a quick walk from the key pickup location to the apartment. The location is perfect for walking to the major areas. It is also in a great location for the buses to Belfast and DART. I felt safe walking back from the station late at night after I attended a concert at RDS arena. The apartment is clean and in a nice building. The coffee shop around the corner has fantastic coffee and fresh baked scones. Joe was welcoming and responsive. Thank you for allowing me to stay!"
5887717,518180780,8/26/2019,The location was great. Easy walking to Grafton and other areas. The apartment itself was clean and the perfect size for 2 people for a weekend.

5887717,522622260,9/2/2019,Awesome space and good location. Very responsive and clear instructions are given. Thanks for a great stay!
5887717,524518955,9/6/2019,"Not much I can add to what others have already stated. Great location, lots of amenities nearby (pubs, restaurants, grocery shops). Temple bar is 10-15 walk away, Grafton street and the shopping district is also 10-15 walk away. Apartment itself was clean and spacious, kitchen is v nice as from the photos with fridge, freezer, oven, toaster etc. Didn't have any problems with the check-in, or check-out process. Only saw a couple of other people in the building. Building itself is quiet, no noise issues. Pictures on the listing are accurate. No issues from me, I would highly recommend to others."
5887717,525987078,9/8/2019,"Very convenient, extremely clean and good value for money. Also, very clear instructions made it easy to find and use. And owner was always easy to get in touch with, very helpful."
5887717,532296211,9/19/2019,The location is great. Nice spacious apartment with a nice balcony. We did have some issues with the water heating and the place couldve been cleaner but we had a nice time.
5887717,546231519,10/13/2019,"Great sta, nice place.. raccomended!"
5887717,553521583,10/24/2019,"We had a great stay with Joe! The apartment was clean and obviously well maintained, and within walking distance of all the great locations we wanted to visit in Dublin. He also included a list of popular attractions and places to go! 

My only (very minor) complaint was it was a bit confusing finding our way to the apartment initially, but Joe had multiple open lines of communication to help us find our way safely and quickly to the apartment. 

Overall: clean space, great communication by Joe, and nice, short distances to many sites in Dublin from the apartment."
5887717,554988600,10/27/2019,All ok
5887717,561909282,11/10/2019,"Great stay in a lovely, very central, cosy apartment."
5892012,419086431,3/3/2019,"Thanks Stephen for having us, it was perfect for what we needed and in a great location. Stephen is super friendly and very helpful. The bed was lovely and comfortable meaning we got a great night sleep."
5892012,427977504,3/24/2019,"Stephen was an excellent host and he made us feel very welcome. The bedroom and bathroom were sparkling clean and even though it was in an apartment complex in the heart of Smithfield, it was super quite and we could even leave the window open all night without being disturbed by any street noise. Stephen's little Pug was adorable. We would certainly come here again."
5892012,431013081,3/31/2019,"Steve's place is in a really great location! Every major attraction is easily within walking distance. Phoenix Park, Jamerson Distillery and a super fun lively cute pub called Cobbleson are ridiculously close to the Air Bnb. Steve goes out of his way to make his home as clean and homely for you."
5892012,433364240,4/6/2019,"The appartment is well located and you are near from almost everything.
Stepen is kind, full of energy and can give you advices about the surroundings.
Unfortunately some things bothered me, taking in account the price and the other Airbnb experiences I had in Dublin and Ireland. To make it simple and not to go into details the experience I had was not as good as expected. I hope it was unforeseen circumstances (and I'm not talking about the dof, who was really funny)"
5892012,434058631,4/7/2019,"Stephen was a great host, very friendly and made us feel welcome. The flat is really well located, has everything you need and the decoration is quite stylish. Loved the dog!!"
5892012,440700221,4/21/2019,"This was the second time we have stayed here. Loved it both times. It was a short stay but we were warmly greeted and well taken care of. The location is very convenient to the Temple bar area, Heuston train station, and city center. We definitely recommend this place to other Airbnb travelers."
5892012,444829895,4/28/2019,"Stephen is a nice and uncomplicated host, I felt very welcome and comfortable. His Appartement is located close to the city center."
5892012,447825689,5/4/2019,"Me and my mom stayed at Stephen's for a night and it was class! The house is cool and very clean. The double room is lovely, the atmosphere is really chill and the bed is super comfy! The toilet is fancy and super clean as well! 
We also had  a chat with Stephen when we came back home in the evening and he's a really lovely person! Then there's also an extra bonus: Maggiel! Stephen's dog! She's the little princess of the house! She enjoys cuddles and attentions! She's the cutest! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anyways, we had a lovely experience art Stephen's and I'd definitely come back! I absolutely recommend it!"
5892012,454494813,5/18/2019,"Stephen has been incredibly accommodating particularly since we arrived very late at night. His home is very clean and cosy with all necessary ammenities. His dog Maggie is very quiet and didnt bother us at all, quite the contrary, shes the sweetest. We will definitely come back here if visiting Dublin again."
5892012,455025215,5/19/2019,Great location and solid accommodations.
5892012,461794039,6/1/2019,"Stephen was a great host! Very friendly and accommodating. Location is good, about a 15-20 min walk to temple bar and the airport bus, and about 5 min walk to Jameson. Very nice guy and has a cute pup as well! :)"

5892012,468372748,6/12/2019,"Excellent host.  Great place and great guy. Steven is adorable and makes you feel at home. Excellent location and even better apartment. 
If I ever return to Dublin I'll definitely stay at Steven's again.  Thank for everything my family and I are so grateful."
5892012,469280798,6/14/2019,"Brilliant location, flat was clean and tidy, Stephen was friendly and welcoming. Also has an adorable wee pug"
5892012,470603767,6/16/2019,Stephen was very hospitable and we felt so well taken care of and welcomed. We only stayed one night but loved how close him home was walking distance from all the sites downtown Dublin. Enjoyed a very restful nights sleep and loved hanging out with his pooch.
5892012,474625727,6/23/2019,"It may be a bit out of the way of the main city, but the place itself is close to a store where you can buy food and a tram line which is awesome! Stephen was a very welcoming and happy host who greeted us with open arms and had many suggestions but stated everything with such enthusiasm. His dog was also very cute and friendly. Always willing to share his food with us but we were too stubborn to not accept his offer, very hospitable. The only thing I will say is that the bed was hard for my comfort, but that is ever bed in Ireland I've slept in so maybe it's a norm there. 
Highly recommended place!"
5892012,482293754,7/6/2019,"Room is tidy, clean and warm and bright. Bed was comfortable. Towels were clean and fresh. Bathroom was fine. Hot water and okay pressure. All in all we had a good stay. It is in a very good location. Hosts were very friendly and welcoming."
5892012,526031973,9/8/2019,The location was very central for me in Smithfield and great access to fab bars and restaurants. A nice quiet apartment and cool  modern bedroom. Stephen is a lovely and generous  host.
5892012,530008338,9/15/2019,"The apartment is located at the center of the city and major tourist attractions and major pubs are at walkable distance. 
Stephen and Leo along with their pet dog Maggie were fantastic host, had great conversation making it a friendly stay. 
Was welcomed with a big smile and Stephen prepared breakfast and coffee for me which it self is enough to explain how good they were."
5892012,534085571,9/22/2019,"Everything was great, apartments location, condition are very good. Stephan is super owner. He support me in difficult situation. Highly recommend"
5892012,545478850,10/12/2019,"Stephen was a great host, and put his best foor forward to make me comfortable and happy.  His responses are prompt, and provides all the necessary information to a new comer/ tourist.
The apartment was cosy, and room/ washroom was quite well kept, clean and comfortable. Location was nice and suitable, in the city centre, with good public transport facilities within walking distance.  
Stephen has an amazing collection of sculptures of Lord Buddha, very tastefully decorated/ placed in the apartment. His initiative of growing tomatoes and other vegetables in his small balcony is worth appreciating. 
A must mention is Maggie, very cute pug, a nice companion in the apartment. I do intend to visit Dublin in this lifetime, and spend more time with Stephen and Maggie..
Wish you all the best.."
5893248,425527981,3/18/2019,"Very nice and clean appartment in great Location.

5893248,473854568,6/22/2019,Great stay! We were given lots of helpful tips about local spots to visit for drinks or eat. The driver we were given from the airport to the apartment was great! He had great communication the day before the flight to know exactly where to find him. He also gave us direction from a map once we got to the house. Host had great response time to answer all of our questions. Seamless check in and lovely small place right outside of the city centre.
5893248,478829494,6/30/2019,"Great little space, perfect for one person but would be a bit squishy for two. Very clean, easy access to buses, great communication from hosts"

5893248,514045136,8/20/2019,I had a great stay and this was the perfect base for my travels while in Ireland. It was especially comfortable for a solo traveler and it was a relaxing stay for my week of day trips and my time in Dublin attending a convention. The public transportation options were especially valuable. The communication from the hosts was great and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again.
5893248,520909676,8/31/2019,"Great location, 30 minute walk to central Dublin. Very clean! Had everything we needed. Enjoyed the pubs they recommended."
5893248,522576593,9/2/2019,"Very nice and cute apartment. Liam and Fiona gave us all the instructions nice and clear to get there and get the key. They were also very fast responsive.  
The place was very clean and organized. We had everything we need. We were able to cook our meals perfectly.

The location is great. Across the street from the bus stop. 2 minutes from a pub, supermarket, coffee shop. 10 minutes from the park. The view from our apartment was also very nice (4th floor). The bed was a sofa bed, bit very easy to assemble and comfortable. 

Weve loved our stay there! We will definitely stay there again."
5893248,526761892,9/9/2019,"Good, clean apartment. A bit sparse, but it met all our needs. The hosts were extremely communicative and provided extensive helpful instructions to ensure a smooth process. The apartment is a bit outside the main city, probably about a 15 minute walk. We enjoyed our stay and would book again."
5893248,546897842,10/14/2019,"Liam and Fionas studio was cozy and welcoming. Our trip to Dublin was amazing and we loved staying in the studio. We cooked meals in the kitchen, always felt safe, and the unit was very clean!"

5893921,428579788,3/25/2019,They can expect to have issues with the toilet. The hot water fluctuates but it had a rather large sitting area. Pots and pans for cooking and two nice size bedrooms.
5893921,430819872,3/31/2019,"Malcolm was a great host, would highly recommend this apartment for its location and ease of check-in. I would stay again. Thanks :)"
5893921,433372533,4/6/2019,Great location and a well appointed clean apartment. Exactly what we needed for a few days in the city.

5893921,437254930,4/14/2019,"I don't think I'd stay at this place again, unless the price was dropped down to an appropriate level (around 100 Euros), or unless Malcolm fixes the issues that multiple people have complained about. The explanations that Malcolm gives are unfortunately not true."
5893921,444151923,4/27/2019,Malcolm's place place was clean and we'll located for our needs. Correspondence was excellent.
5893921,445367630,4/29/2019,"This is a great location for visiting Dublin, and the host was responsive to our texts. The beds were comfortable and the apartment was quiet. We had difficulty figuring out how the heating works. The carpets and shower could use a little attention. All and all it was a reasonable value for the Dublin area."
5893921,447346022,5/3/2019,Great place to stay in the city. A quick walk to the luas
5893921,449354423,5/6/2019,"As always we had an amazing stay in Dublin. Such a marvellous city.
The apartment was not our favourite. Even though the location is perfect and in walking distance of everything and easily accessible from the airport or if u want to do a day trip to Howth for example.
However the place was a bit dusty and we had quite a few problems with the hot water arrangement. 
Since the host was not very communicative it felt a bit uncomfortable sometimes"
5893921,453552375,5/16/2019,Malcolm's apartment was excellent.  It was very convenient to everything we needed in Dublin.  We would recommend it to future guests
5893921,455149941,5/19/2019,Basic appartment with ok location.
5893921,458056695,5/25/2019,A comfortable and well supplied accommodation. The location of the unit is excellent for visitors to Dublin. Close to a transport hub it is also within walking distane of many of Dublin's main sights. It was perfect for us as first time visitors.
5893921,460092852,5/28/2019,"Malcolms place is great! Clean, great location and roomy. I highly recommend it!"
5893921,462828591,6/2/2019,"The apartment is located in a gated community which is good since there are many homeless people and drug addicts striking around on the north side.
The apartment is well sized and the beds were comfortable. It was silent. The instructions on how to get to the apartment were very good and there was also an information broschure in the apartment with good tips.
The apartment was rather damp and it was obvious that the host doesnt live there on a regular basis."
5893921,466595841,6/9/2019,"Very nice, quiet apartment situated in a great location in Dublin.  Everything you need for a city break."
5893921,468407032,6/12/2019,Great location. Spacious flat in good complex. Helpful and responsive host. Would recommend.
5893921,469268579,6/14/2019,"The apartment was in a great location and very close to amenities - 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area, touristy area. 
Space was in a quiet gated area, was large and roomy  but in some serious need of TLC, some small repairs and some professional cleaning!"
5893921,470664000,6/16/2019,Good location
5893921,473282385,6/21/2019,"If youre thinking of staying at Malcolms apartment in Customs House Harbour make sure he had attended to - water that wont go down the bathroom sink and shower, the faulty room heaters, the cupboard with only half a hinge, the shower handle hanging by one dodgy screw, the filthy cooking utensils, the moth-eaten and tatty towels, the weeds on the balcony, the filthy glass on the balcony doors, the filthy oven, the dirty  and damp linen of previous renters in the cupboards and make sure the cupboards are free from clothes of previous renters. If he can guarantee those things, then the location is good. And be careful not to pay too much for what you get and dont take Malcolms word that he will deliver what he promises."
5893921,481122871,7/4/2019,Malcolm's place was conveniently located and had everything we needed for our stay. I was particularly appreciative of the activity and restaurant suggestions he provided. The beds were comfortable and the curtains were effective at blocking out the light--I slept really well!
5893921,486995401,7/13/2019,"The place is in great center location. Easy walk to everything you would ever need in Dublin. Multiple public transportation options too. Apartment itself is a good size, has a balcony overlooking water and has everything you'd want in a kitchen. My biggest concern was a bathroom that needs a good scrubbing and all the drains needs to be cleaned. Sink fills up instantly when attempting to wash hands and shower fills up with dirty water while taking a shower. We also had issue with short supply of hot water. I did contact the host about the issues and never got a response."
5893921,488722657,7/15/2019,"The flat is in a great location, just across the river from Trinity College.   A few good pubs and restaurants close by.

Malcolm was not good replying to emails and we had to borrow a phone to get any response from him.   Then he emailed access codes etc.   The flat is nice but rather small - typical of city center locations.   It is in need of a little TLC - there are a few minor items that need to be fixed and also while we were there, there were large sacks of dirty laundry in the closets.   Easy free parking adjacent to the entrance was an added bonus in town."
5893921,493993085,7/23/2019,"Great location.  As mentioned in previous reviews, the furniture and carpet could use some upgrading, but everything worked, the kitchen was stocked and the apartment was comfortable.  The main tourist areas are a 10 minute walk and the place is fairly quiet except for the seagulls that squawk early in the morning.  Thanks Malcolm."
5893921,498716085,7/30/2019,"Malcolm's apartment was exactly as described.  It was clean, comfortable, well appointed, and only a short walk to major tourist attractions in the city center, and particularly the convention centre, which was my destination every day.  The weather was very nice during our stay, which made the balcony a very nice place to relax at the end of the day.  There were some easily fixed maintenance issues that I have corresponded to Malcolm privately about, and which I am sure will/were be dealt with before the next guests arrive. I highly recommend this property."
5893921,502203943,8/4/2019,"The appartment is at a great location. Only about 15 minute walk to the city centre. The living room is quite big and the WiFi is excellent. Beds are ok and there is plenty of closet space.

However, there are definetely some things that need to be fixed. These things have been mentioned before in previous reviews and are still not fixed. Things like not having hot water, the appartment feeling dusty and smelling weird, old laundry in the closets, etc.

Malcolm is not the best at responding to messages either. Once we had made the booking, it took about 4-5 messages to get the check-in instructions and get confirmation on a earlier check-in. After confirming our check-in and asking some questions, Malcolm didnt respond any more.

Overall I probably wont stay there again until the issues have been fixed and Malcolm does a better job at commucating."
5893921,514018674,8/20/2019,"Very handy two bedroom flat close to CCD,in the middle of the financial district. Comfortable, clean, good facilities, parking, and lots nearby. We had a great time."
5893921,518906890,8/27/2019,Malcom was easy to reach when we needed him. Great location!
5893921,521678204,9/1/2019,"Good central location, everything you would need for a stay in Dublin"
5893921,523718735,9/4/2019,"Good location, comfy and spacious. Nice host"
5893921,530094532,9/15/2019,"Location is excellent for access to all of Dublins highlights.  
One of the reasons we choose this property was because of parking but after arriving and contacting the owner found out that parking access (card needed to open gate) was not available but would be okay because always cars ""coming and going"".  
Not really acceptable.
Property was as described, great to have a washing machine!  Some minor maintenance issues would have been nice.
Overall happy with the property."
5893921,536331166,9/26/2019,"Nice location, host did allow us to check in early, which was nice , since we had luggage with us. Apartment was ok, really needs updates.  Mold in bathroom, shower door handle is un-attached. Really dangerous.  Furniture dirty and shredded. Directions for gate and door confusing. Especially for people
That dont use such entry ways.  Host needs to rewrite directions to be more clear."
5914552,423159879,3/13/2019,Nice guys. The accommodation is very central and the check in was very easy. Little furnished room.
5914552,428547417,3/25/2019,"Great place to stay in Dublin. It was very clean and comfortable, very near to the center of the city. Thanks for everything!"
5914552,437055747,4/14/2019,Wijk is super is waar ze wonen! Alles goed te voet te doen
5914552,440721273,4/21/2019,We had a lovely stay at Padraig and Iuris apartment. They were very friendly and easy to communicate with. Our room was simple and cleanîexactly what we needed. The apartment was in a great location near the canal and we were able to walk throughout the city without needing public transportation. Recommend to friends!
5914552,444693658,4/28/2019,"We had a great time staying here, the host(s) were very friendly and helpful. Also our late check in was no problem at all :) would recommend!"
5914552,449670891,5/7/2019,"Easy to find, well connected location (buses, tram, foot). We had a nice stay at Padraig and Iuri's."
5914552,458543482,5/26/2019,"Lovely appartement, spotless and arranged with great taste. Padraigand Iuri are really nice and quiet people, we couldn't have hoped for a better stay than the one we had! We highly recommend !"
5914552,467899913,6/11/2019,Great location! Great option for the price. Super cozy.
5914552,470487452,6/16/2019,Luri was very accommodating. The apartment is in an excellent location. Nice building.  The bed is a little on the hard side.  Overall a good experience.
5914552,475564811,6/24/2019,Great place to rest the head and shower after exploring Dublin all day!
5914552,494000747,7/23/2019,Very nice contact and good location.
5914552,497254784,7/28/2019,"Wonderful place. Location was ideal- just marks the border between rathmines and portobello, both safe and hip and fun areas with lots of coffee, interesting restaurants, and only a short walk downtown. Easy access to and from the airport - a bus and a 7 minute walk. 

Iuri and Padraig were timely in their communication and even let us check in early when we arrived at Dublin mid morning. Would highly recommend them and this place for anyone coming to Dublin."
5914552,508028363,8/12/2019,"Paddy and Iuri have a lovely flat in a convenient location, a short walk from the city. The airport express bus takes you very close to their flat which is convenient. Check in was easy and they were very responsive to my texts and understanding of a delayed flight. They recommended a cafe for breakfast which was absolutely gorgeous. Thank you!"
5914552,529913947,9/15/2019,Great accommodation and location!
5914552,544147003,10/9/2019,The location of the apartment is brilliant. The bus & the Luas are easy to reach. Its also possible to walk into town. The check-in and communication was really easy. We recommend the apartment.
5914552,559529948,11/4/2019,"Great locatio,  close to the Portobello canals. I recommend this place to anyone looking to stay over in Dublin"
5914552,562027159,11/10/2019,Location location... and this is exactly what you need. Thanks for a great stay. Perfect location & everything we need from a weekend stay in Dublin.
5914552,568341923,11/24/2019,We thank Padraig and Iuri for the kindness and hospitality! Great location and a clean bedroom with enough space for our bags. A good place for a short stay over in Dublin. The hosts were easily reachable by phone and email for practical questions and the airline bus connection stops only 5 minutes away (walking) from the appartment.
5931145,422862035,3/12/2019,"We were disappointed. The room was smaller than expected, there was no proper heating, the bedsheet was covered with hair and little pieces of black cotton. There was no heating in the bathroom."
5931145,430853238,3/31/2019,"Very attentive hosts, super helpful and made it a very easy experience thank you!"
5931145,440030719,4/20/2019,"Very nice hosts, the Air bnb was very clean"
5931145,442353183,4/23/2019,"Thank you for being excellent hosts and we really appreciated the helpfulness, tips, and providing a safe, clean, and lovely place to make our stay in Dublin extra wonderful."
5931145,452964018,5/14/2019,"This is such a wonderful place to stay. Liam and Fiona made the instructions very clear on how to get in, and we are able to travel around the city if we dont have a car. The place is adorable and cozy and inviting we actually ended up spending an evening just hanging out there! There is a cute coffee shop around the corner called Love Supreme about a 10 min walks worth and then a few places to eat and none of them were disappointing. Its about a 25-30 min walk to the Quays and city center but its doable. Definitely would recommend and stay again when visiting Dublin! Thank you Liam and Fiona!!"
5931145,463856626,6/4/2019,Great place to stay!! We especially appreciate Liam and Fionas thorough list of recommendations in the area including local restaurants/pubs. Gary was beyond excellent in assisting us from the airport including carrying our bags upstairs and providing a map/directions to the city center. The accommodations were small but perfect for 2 people. We stayed in the Oscar Wilde room. Very quiet at night.
5931145,478115528,6/29/2019,Very walkable to city center and the beautiful Phoenix Park!
5931145,495031759,7/25/2019,"A small cozy apartament with everything you need for your stay. Very convenient that the bus stop is right there, a few footsteps away from the front door."
5931145,503743495,8/6/2019,I loved it! They were very accommodating and quick to answer any questions. They went above and beyond!
5931145,518728921,8/27/2019,Liam and Fionas Oscar Wilde studio was great! It was close to everything we needed! We had so much fun staying there.
5931145,519796540,8/29/2019,"The flat was a small space but perfect for me and my partner located on the 3rd floor, quiet but a few flights of stairs. Liam and Fiona were very helpful before our arrival with suggestions of what to do in the city and the local buses. They also offered to book us a private transfer from the airport to the accommodation. We decided to pass on this as we couldn't check in until later in the day and we found a bus pass from the airport the ""DoDublin"" very useful for getting to and from the airport and also getting around the city VERY good value for money!! The great thing was the bus stop was right outside the accomodation and they were very frequent so we always had a way of getting around the city. Thank you so much Liam and Fiona for making this trip better for us!!"
5931145,524693932,9/6/2019,"Apartment is in a great location: close to markets, pubs and restaurants. The bus station is just in front of the apartment. 
The communication with the host is perfect, Liam and Fiona are very kind and response quickly. My husband and I, we spent three nights and four days, for us was a little small but the place has everything that you need and its very clean. 
Thanks Liam and Fiona for your hospitality and kindness."
5931145,528532810,9/13/2019,We had a great time and appreciated all the sight-seeing tips!
5931145,539389841,10/1/2019,A great affordable spot with easy access to downtown.
5931145,549998889,10/18/2019,"Very clean, close to city center and easy check-in!"
5931145,559526493,11/4/2019,Nice place just a bus ride away from the centre.
5931145,567720541,11/23/2019,Fiona and Liams place is very nice! Would love to stay here again when Im back in Dublin.
5935770,428497587,3/25/2019,"Brilliant location, great value for money. Really loved my stay here. Excellent communication from David, was very easy to get in touch with him."
5935770,432931511,4/5/2019,"David's place is excellent and the apartment is so central

Only issue is that the lack of amenities such as milk for coffee

And the girl who takes care of the place was late

Also please be aware that there is an extra cost for electricity not stated any where

Other than that an amazing place"
5935770,435722262,4/11/2019,Cool!
5935770,443662843,4/26/2019,Best location
5935770,450708826,5/10/2019,Great place and excellent host
5935770,452964933,5/14/2019,Charging 10 euro for electricity after you ve already booked is not on. All charges should be clearly stated before . It's basically stealing as you as you don't have the option of canceling your booking. But I think it's Airbnb responsibility to prevent this. Other than that it is a good flat in a good location.
5935770,461947193,6/1/2019,Very responsive host and a great location! Highly recommend this spot
5935770,465275761,6/7/2019,Central and lots of space. Good communication.
5935770,470513768,6/16/2019,Lovely clean apartment. In the heart of Dublin City with great access to everything Dublin has to offer. Check in was quick and easy as was the check out. Nothing negative to say about the apartment or the process.
5935770,473275869,6/21/2019,Great location!
5935770,478989444,6/30/2019,"We had a good time in Dublin. The apartment is really well located and David was very friendly and helpful. The land lady met us and she was very helpful as well.

The apartment itself is very clean and well looked after. For a weekend for 6 people its absolutely perfect, but any longer than that and I might find somewhere else. Its very much like a student house, a bit rough around the edge, but for the cost of stay and for a couple of nights its absolutely perfect. Plus the service was very good so overall I have no issues."
5935770,480174370,7/2/2019,Great location.  The accommodation is a little tired.
5935770,481801296,7/5/2019,What a nice surprise to find this huge space available in the Temple Bar area and at that price! The rooms are spacious and the washer/dryer was a life saver after traveling for 8 days and getting there with a suitcase of dirty clothes. Ive seen 1 or 2 people comment on the noise but they apparently didnt read or comprehend where they were staying - near Temple Bar. Im a light sleeper and all it took was some ear plugs and I slept through the night. An amazing value for a group - I stayed alone and it was still a great value for 1! Highly recommended.
5935770,483070118,7/7/2019,Nice Clean apartment to stay in...is as described...nice and close to city centre.
5935770,485265214,7/10/2019,Davids place is great for a group that doesnt mind the loud city noise. I liked the place I was just surprised how noisy it was late at night and early in the morning.
5935770,487781178,7/14/2019,Amazing location and good value - only downside was the toilet being mostly unusable.
5935770,502158775,8/4/2019,"The apartment was fantastically situated, although it was a little tired and in need of a little TLC it was nice and clean we would definitely stay again."
5935770,507147359,8/11/2019,"Clean, great location. Would stay again."
5935770,509274109,8/14/2019,Great location for all the action of Dublin
5935770,515203222,8/22/2019,Cannot beat the location! Will book again next time we're in Dublin :)
5935770,525239056,9/7/2019,"You will absolutely love this spacious flat.  Simply and elegantly appointed, you'll feel at home right away.  You are in the heart of the city with all the amenities that city centre offers; however, you are also in the heart of the city with everyone else who is enjoying it, so you may want to bring a set of ear plugs just in case you are a light sleeper.  If you enjoy stretching your legs, you will have endless tourist attraction destinations at your toe-tips.  Less inclined to wracking up mileage on your pedometer??  Not a bother, as finding transportation in David's ideal location is easy-peasy."
5935770,528642561,9/13/2019,"David's place is perfectly located for seeing central Dublin.  
Some street noise early in the evening. An older place but clean,  neat and tidy.  
Good value for money."
5935770,530077907,9/15/2019,"Check-in and communication worked very well.  Great location in the heart of Dublin. 

Unfortunately the apartment is very old and rustic and the host should think about a refurbishment. We did not feel too comfortable in there. Especially for the high price we would have expected a higher quality. The ""double beds"" are very small and not ideal for more than 1 person.  The water pipes sound like they're dripping.  The inside is very sound sensitive and even with closed windows you can hear everything from the outside."
5935770,532280446,9/19/2019,Ottimo
5935770,536788492,9/27/2019,Nice place and nice area
5935770,538072551,9/29/2019,What location !! A great place to stay.
5935770,539922826,10/2/2019,"After traveling Europe the past month, I needed a place that was close to everything and yet quiet and spacious. I FOUND IT IN THIS Airbnb! More than enough rooms to accommodate large groups or families. 

Its close to Temple Bar and City Center. The bus ride from the airport to the apartment was really fast and close. 

Your gonna love the quick replys and suggestions from the owner and the house cleaner. They are awesome!

Ill be back! See ya next time Dublin!"
5939399,425424956,3/18/2019,Lovely location to discover Dublin! Our hosts were quick to respond and provided an easy check in with our plane landing so early in the morning. They provided local favourite spots to go to and a few bevys in the fridge. Their home is beautiful and would love to stay again!
5946473,419984502,3/5/2019,"Linda is friendly and very knowledgeable on places to visit in Dublin, especially if you like music. She fed us breakfast every morning and had nice coffee too! What a nice place to stay."
5946473,422904687,3/12/2019,"Linda's place is the best location for a holiday or short term business travellers as it is halfway between the city centre and the airport.  Literally, all that you need is just 5 minutes walk away, a green and silent area where you could chill after huge hiking or a long night at the bar area. A bus stop with all the buses to the city centre/airport, 12 mins from Drumcondra railway station, restaurants, bars, a Tesco with reliable prices. The apartment is clean and you are able to start your day with a coffee and a croissant even in the garden.  Who book a hotel room nowdays? :)"
5946473,426241878,3/20/2019,Everything was perfect! Linda is really friendly and can also help with everything! Hightly recommend!
5946473,427931500,3/24/2019,"Lindas place is warm and comfy, with music-inspired decor and all the amenities - a first rate stay."
5946473,431540855,4/1/2019,"My research reflected this would be the best area of Dublin for it's ""in-betweenness"" ¶.  to the airport and the Dublin experiences.   Bus transport was ""just"" the right way to get around AND they all had open WiFi!!!!   The TESCO shopping center, near by, outfitted us with a good cell plan and Sim card.    Eateries & Pubs just down the block.    Had looked into other Airbnb's in the area but this one stood-out."
5946473,434725108,4/8/2019,"We had a great time at Linda's place, which is a traditional cosy house in Dublin - close to the airport and close to the center (by bus or taxi). There are nice places to eat out close to her place too, as well as a park and bus stations. The communication was good too as she was very helpful at all times and replied within max 30 minutes. Every morning Linda had a breakfast prepared for us and even asked us what we would prefer. There was delicious good (not filter) coffee and we could use the whole kitchen, Internet was good, bathroom very clean, the room cosy with kettle and tea and heating so we were never cold. Linda can give you recommendatiosn for Dublin and around, especially pubs and traditional music. we definitely recommend this airbnb :)"
5946473,439505814,4/19/2019,"Everything was as described, we had a great time and would definitely recommend staying at Linda's! We especially loved the breakfast options ;) Thanks!"
5946473,445510341,4/29/2019,"Een prettige ruimte, gezellig huis met gedeelde ruimtes maar veel privacy. Linda heeft het goed voor elkaar voor de gasten !! Wij hebben haar nauwelijks gezien of gehoord, maar konden via app haar altijd goed bereiken. Ze reageerde zeer vlot en behulpzaam. Zeer tevreden over dit verblijf."
5946473,451250996,5/11/2019,Our stay at Lindas place was fantastic. She was caring and had great advices for discovering Dublin and the places around Dublin. We followed some of her recommendations and were so happy we did. Also Linda was always available and provided us breakfast and fresh towels. Shes living in a lovely little house close to Dublin city. I would book her place again if I go back to Ireland :)
5946473,456701502,5/22/2019,Such a lovely person! Helped us with local knowledge... had brekky waiting for us every morning. Cosy bedroom and nice clean bathroom.. we loved it!
5946473,460051155,5/28/2019,Linda made us feel at home the second we arrived for the visit. She was great helping with directions from the airport to her place and even made special accommodations for us to check in a bit early the day we arrived. Linda recommended great local spots to visit and day trips to explore areas outside of the city. Linda also provided breakfast every morning (pastries and coffee) and again went out of her way to provide nut free options for breakfast for a peanut allergy. I highly recommend anyone visiting Dublin to stay with Linda if they have the opportunity!
5946473,466544699,6/9/2019,"It was a pleasant stay at Lindas AirBnB. We really liked the local tips which Linda gave us!  Every morning she brings us a little breakfast, this was lovely. Also the connection from the AirBnB into the city was good, because not far away from there is a  bus station from where you come in between 20 minutes into city centre."
5946473,475451256,6/24/2019,"Quiet room, nice bathroom, well situated between airport and city center. Real nice detail: Linda bought some breakfast for us :) ..she was hardly at home while we were there (fine by us, we're shy ;-) ), real easy going as well :) .. very recommendable!"
5946473,478891745,6/30/2019,"Really enjoyed staying with Linda. Nice comfy bed, lovely breakfast and coffee and I absolutely loved the garden "
5946473,519328236,8/28/2019,Great stay! Linda and the place were quite lovely - highly recommend!
5946473,529193962,9/14/2019,"Very nice place, cute little garden, calm neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay!"
5946473,543178407,10/7/2019,"Great host with a warm, welcoming environment- especially for a first time traveler! I would definitely stay here again! City Center was easily accessible by walking or using a leapcard for the bus!"
5946473,550768161,10/19/2019,"ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
My stay with Linda was AMAZING!!!!! The house is extremely clean, we walk from the house to temple bar everyday, she left yogurts, bread, ham and cheese for us and gave us great local recomendations, she also was in contact everytime. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!"
5946473,557098989,10/31/2019,"The Linda's place is very good. Clean, comfortable, everything works well, strong reliable WiFi. Location is a bit far (30 min walks to the center of Dublin) but if you are fit and energetic it's not a problem. Besides, you need to burn the thousands of calories of Irish food and Guinness! If walking is too hard, there are convenient buses, stops are 2 min. from home. 
Linda is an excellent host. Quick responses, great advice and suggestions. The check-in and check-out were a breeze. The breakfast food is delicious - yogurt, cheeses, cereals, juices, bread and of course tea, coffee. 
I would recommend this place 100%!"
5964227,418541816,3/2/2019,Great room in a residential area close to centre. Good opportunity to experience real Dublin life but still be close to all the tourist areas.
5964227,423160373,3/13/2019,"Sarah, Jhon & Jack are excellent hosts, the room is great and you have all kinds of help if you need it, we received a great deal and they helped us a lot.

5964227,427809947,3/24/2019,"Sarah and her boyfriend made us feel very welcome. The room is small but you will find everything you need, like tea, coffee and cookies en Sarah made a map with usefull places to eat and take the bus. You can easily walk to the centre. No taxi needed (except to go to the airport)."

5964227,435116676,4/9/2019,Sarah was an absolutely wonderful host and her place was cute and clean. The room was in the perfect location. Transport connections were great - bus running past the house into the city centre. Thanks a lot!
5964227,438295031,4/16/2019,"Quiet, lovely neighborhood and literally a 20 second walk from the bus stop taking you to the center (in 15 mins)! The view is of a pretty park so you feel like you're outside of town but is so convenient to go back and forth. Sarah is so sweet and the room is so cozy, it felt like a true BnB:) Highly recommended."

The house is in a lovely, safe family area of Dublin. A bus stops outside the house so you are into Dublin city centre in no time. Everywhere was immaculately clean and tidy. I loved that Sarah had left tea and coffee making facilities in the room  and bottles of water. Bed was very comfy too. We intend to come back and stay again. Thank you!"
5964227,482379377,7/6/2019,"Sara and Paul were really nice with us, Sara gave us a map and some recommendations to have a great time at Dublin.  The room was comfortable and well equipped."

Lots of thoughtful touches like toiletries, water, coffee,tea, fridge with milk, plenty of bottled water, cookies, sweets, a good selection of books with the offer that you can keep one if you want!, well researched and written information on local travel places to eat etc. 
So much to recommend I've probably missed something out.
Perfect Airbnb experience at a fraction of the cost of Dublin Hotel prices."
5964227,535900215,9/25/2019,My stay was wonderful. Easy check in and great communication. Very thoughtful touches including the makings for tea. Would highly recommend.
5964227,540392844,10/3/2019,"Not recommended.  Confined to a bedroom without a chair, and no access to TV or radio."
5964227,547883911,10/16/2019,"Sarah and Paul are  very welcoming  thoughtful hosts. The location is great as Marino is a friendly neighbourhood, it is  easy to reach the Centre but quiet at night,  local shops and bars and Fairview Park near to enjoy some peace after a day in a very  busy city. The room has good cupboards with shelves and hanging space, a kettle and coffee, teabags etc. The bed was very comfy and warm.  The shared bathroom and shower is adjacent and all were clean and convenient.  Sarah has excellent local information in the room and is happy to help but also able to give you privacy. An excellent reasonably priced place to stay which I very much recommend.  I will happily return!"

5990142,423208300,3/13/2019,"Stayed one night at Julie & Audrey's flat. Communication was very good, and they were extremely helpful re. late check in.  The flat is only 10min from the airport, so very convenient if you have a late/early flight. The place was sparkling clean and had small details like tea/coffee and biscuits. The bed is ultra comfortable, and shower was good too. I would definitely return!"
5990142,424733912,3/17/2019,"The apartment was even better than described. It is 5 minutes away from the airport - in handy when you have to take a late night or early morning flight. There are some supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, all very close, so you have all the accessibility.

The room and private bath - both were very clean and spacious. Julie and Audrey were excellent hosts. Highly recommended and definitely will book again when I visit Dublin!"
5990142,426851194,3/22/2019,I needed a last minute place to stay before catching a flight out. The location is right near the airport and easy to access.

5990142,446790990,5/2/2019,Julie and Audrey have set up a wonderful space for guests in an extremely convenient location. They were wonderful hosts throughout - from communication in advance to providing great advice on travelling in and around Dublin. It was such a pleasure!
5990142,448579924,5/5/2019,The Hosts for this Air BnB were super kind and accommodating. Audrey was kind enough to book us a taxi for when we had an early morning flight out of Dublin! They provide you with some tour maps and pamphlets which is very convenient. Everything was super clean and they even cleaned the place during our stay a refreshed our towels and things like that. Although we found the place seemed pretty far from the city centre its location is nicely beside the Dublin Airport which made our flight out at 6am so much easier and cheaper via taxi. My sister and I would both highly recommend this place!
5990142,449343679,5/6/2019,Super professional and great place to stay! Very easy to get to the airport and city centre via bus from this location as well. Highly recommend.

5990142,454405691,5/18/2019,"The apartment is spotlessly clean and very modern and comfortable. It is accessible to Dublin City Centre and particularly Dublin airport. The area also has shops and cafes and a gym nearby.  Audrey and Julie were great hosts; they met me on my arrival after I had to change my arrival time to much later than originally planned. The bedroom and bathroom were separate from the main living accommodation, affording a non-intrusive overnight stay. I would have no hesitation in recommending it."
5990142,455158840,5/19/2019,"Really comfortable and quiet place, everything is clean and the little attentions like the amienities for breakfast are pleasant. The location is pretty convenient when you are taking a plane. Julie and Audrey were very kind with us."

5990142,464234135,6/5/2019,I enjoyed my brief stay at Audrey and Julies apartment. It is close to the airport and was very quiet and clean. Audrey was kind to call me a taxi in the morning back to the airport - this is a great place to stay for one or two nights!
5990142,466591626,6/9/2019,"It was neat and tidy. A television would have been a nice touch but at the end of the day, this was an honest room with a clean bed and thats all I needed."

5990142,472312899,6/19/2019,"Julie and Audreys place was perfect for our last night of a long trip. They are very close to the airport and their apartment was easy to find. The room is well furnished with guide books, taxi and good info, and even snacks. The bathroom was very updated and had some toiletries also available. Check in was easy and the home was quiet. A bonus was getting to meet their sweet dog!"
5990142,473829963,6/22/2019,"Julie & Audreys place is as advertised, a clean double room with your own bathroom, perfect for a day or 2 in Dublin, before or after a flight or concert. No sitting area in bedroom, so not suitable for longer stay. Close to public transportation, and a shuttle to and from airport at Holiday Inn Express, about 10 min walk from appartment"
5990142,476397887,6/26/2019,"It was basically like staying at a hotel but in someones home! Location suited us to a t... we were flying in one day and flying out the next to Canada so being close to the airport was key. Not far on the bus to Dublin City Centre either although I think I'd stay closer if we didn't need to be close to the airport. 

Hosts were lovely and the bedroom/bathroom had everything we needed including some sweet treats!"
5990142,478841092,6/30/2019,"The room was perfect for what I needed--a late-night stay between flights into and out of Dublin airport. There was coffee and tea and two pastries in my room for breakfast, the bed was so comfortable for a weary traveler, and they communicated the access information clearly. If all you need is a bed near the Dublin Airport  and access to a lovely bathroom, this is the place. Note that taxi fare from the airport is give or take 15 Pounds. Taking the 41 Bus from just north of the intersection of Swords Road and Northwood Avenue (a 15 minute walk) was 2.50."
5990142,481669209,7/5/2019,Julie and Audreys place was perfect for what we needed. Super close to the airport and in a nice area. Had a very comfortable stay!
5990142,482243076,7/6/2019,"Staying with Audrey and Julie was such a wonderful experience! Their apartment was impeccably clean and organized down to the very detail. They made it very easy for us when we arrived and were very hospitable and welcoming, along with their VERY cute puppies! The apartment was very calm, quiet and conveniently close to the airport. The bedroom was equipped with a mini fridge with water and OJ, and the pasties and tea came in handy, since we had a flight the next day and no time to grab food. Audrey was even nice enough to order us a taxi for the next morning to take us to the airport. Also, the apt is just a short walk down the main drag to McDonalds, Costa Coffee and other shops. I would highly recommend this room to any dog-lovers looking for a place near the airport!"
5990142,483103161,7/7/2019,Simple clean room in a quiet green location close to the airport. Practical for a sleep over if you need to catch the flight early AM.

5990142,485140910,7/10/2019,"My partner and I stayed at Julie and Audrey's place during our layover in Dublin. It's a perfect location if you need a place to crash overnight. It provides quick access to the airport and it's close enough to take a taxi to Dubin's city center, if you want to and have time. The bedroom and bathroom for guests were very clean and included some basic amenities (coffee, pastries, juice, basic toiletries, etc). Julie and Audrey were very friendly hosts and they have the cutest trio of little dogs! I highly recommend staying here!"
5990142,486852853,7/13/2019,Julie and Audrey are great hosts and the flat is good located. Especially when you need to go to the airport in the morning it's perfect. We can definitely recommend it!
5990142,487817679,7/14/2019,"Julie and Audrey's place is in a great location if you need to be close to the Dublin airport! We were only a 5-minute car ride from the airport, which was great after two weeks of traveling. The apartment is very clean and their communication with us leading up to checking in was great. The only thing to note is that there is a dog in the apartment, which I don't recall seeing on the listing. We didn't see the dog at all, but heard it barking for a while when we did self check-in and heard it running around the hallway in the evening. It wasn't a big issue for us, but something to note if you are not into dogs or want absolute quiet during your stay."
5990142,488519688,7/15/2019,Great place to stay near the airport..very clean and all you need for a night or two.
5990142,489174224,7/16/2019,"I stayed here during an overnight layover. Taxi there was 13 euros and I took the bus in the morning (~3 euros). The room and bathroom was very clean, cozy, and perfect for what I needed. Check in was very easy with a lockbox as the hosts were not home at the time of my check in. Would stay here again!"
5990142,494924471,7/25/2019,"We used the room to visit Dublin. There are two bus stops in the near you can use to see Dublin. In under 10min walking there is Lidl and Spar.
Julie and Audrey are very hospitable, even though they are not always to meet.
The dogs were our highlight, they are so super cute and trustingly!

The airport is really close to that home!

Thank you very much! "
5990142,499901638,8/1/2019,Perfect stop for the airport. We had an early flight and a late arrival and they were perfect with accommodating our trip!
5990142,503734722,8/6/2019,Lovely apartment close to Dublin.
5990142,507176097,8/11/2019,"If you want to stay close to the airport for one night to get there quickly, we can recommend staying there."
5990142,508655055,8/13/2019,A lovely host conveniently located to Dublin airport. Highly recommend for a flexible check-in or late flight
5990142,514442184,8/21/2019,"Accurate description of the place, Julie and Audrey were very helpful and kind. The place is close to the airport which was perfect as we needed to catch an early flight the day we left. Close also to public transportation. Wouldn't doubt to recommend the place to friends in the future."
5990142,516245095,8/24/2019,"Julie and Audrey are some of the most well-organized Airbnb hosts that I have stayed with. The room is very comfortable and conveniently close to the airport. If youre looking for a good nights sleep before or after your travels, I would definitely recommend!"
5990142,519404959,8/28/2019,"Hosts were lovely and friendly. The space is clean and modern. However we did run into a few issues worth noting:
1. This price is set for 1 person, unlike most other listings on airbnb. You will be charged additional money for another guest.
2. There is an additional cleaning fee, which may not be apparent without clicking on the additional cost section.
3. Response time is lacking with this host: I messaged them on July 28th with the exact question: Will there be additional fees that will need to be paid at arrival or check-out?ù Host responded on August 26 at 6:36 (less than 24 hours before our stay and too late to cancel per the cancellation policy) saying that they would be charging extra for another person. Response time of over 4 weeks later is concerning of superhostù status.
4. The apartment is 13 minutes from the airport by car per (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps (not 5 minutes as listed in the description.) If arriving by bus from the airport, note that its a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute walk from the bus stop.

All in all, I wouldve canceled and booked at a local hotel for the confusing fee structure of this shared space if the host wouldve given me a response in adequate time."
5990142,519725077,8/29/2019,Ladies were compassionate toward a medical issue I was having during my stay.
5990142,520436363,8/30/2019,"Sehr hilfsbereite und freundliche Gastgeber und alles sauber. Super vom Flughafen zu erreichen. 
Jeder Zeit wieder. :)"
5990142,521663831,9/1/2019,"This place was wonderful as it was close to the airport, reasonably priced and the hosts were very hospitable and had some of the best instructions! The space was cosy, clean and comfortable. Also really appreciated the signs on the door as it made me coming in late at night very easy to know where to go without risk of waking someone. I appreciated the little snacks and pamphlet with local suggestions. Would definitely stay here again if I was passing through Dublin!"
5990142,522622476,9/2/2019,"Great space, hotel like standard with small touches that make a difference, even a mini fridge! And a sparkling clean bathroom. I will definitely be back if I need to stay in the area. Thank you!"
5990142,525191805,9/7/2019,Sehr zu  empfehlen. Es war alles sauber. Die Wohnung ist direkt am Park und nur 5-10 Minuten vom Airport entfernt (Bus). In die City ist es auch nicht weit. Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich gewesen.
5990142,526042218,9/8/2019,"Julie and Audrey were so sweet and accommodating to our needs. They have a great spot, with easy access to the airport and local shops and restaurants. Their home was exactly what we needed to end our trip to Ireland!"

5990142,530704696,9/16/2019,"We loved our stay at Julie and Audrey's. They were both very kind and friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. Their apartment is beautiful and very close to the airport and Dublin city centre. It's a great location if you don't want to be right in the city. The room itself was great. I loved that they included a mini fridge, kettle and some snacks. They also had a little booklet with all kinds of information on the area. It was very well done and came in handy. The bed was very comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The bathroom was very clean and modern. I wish we had been able to stay longer at Julie and Audrey's as we loved their apartment. We would highly recommend their place!"
5990142,532218077,9/19/2019,"Julie and Audreys place was a perfect little stop over for my one day in Dublin. Its super close to the airport, either a 15 min walk + 10 bus ride or a quick taxi will get you there for ‚Ç¨8-9. It was so cozy, they even had tea and coffee set out for my early morning flight. I took the bus into the city center and it was easy to navigate getting around from their place even without phone service. Thanks again for a relaxing stay during my stop over!"
5990142,532688612,9/20/2019,Great spot!
5990142,536797331,9/27/2019,We had a lovely stay at Julie & Audreys home. Sparkling clean with thoughtful touches and really close to the airport.
5995991,420214207,3/6/2019,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5995991,427988402,3/24/2019,"Beautiful location with fantastic views. 
Will definitely recommend for others looking for accommodation"
5995991,431035007,3/31/2019,Lovely apartment to stay in. Great location. Communication was excellent and check in was easy. would recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin :)
5995991,432289234,4/3/2019,"Great views and great location away from Temple Bar. If you want to be in the heart of things, this won't work for you. But, if you like to retreat to peace and quiet and the views of the quay, then you will find this suits perfectly! On the bus line so you can easily access what you want so it shouldn't deter. I have horrible feet and walking was not fun, but I still liked the local. The apartment was clean and sophisticatedîa little tired in placesîbut it is a rental. Could use some new paint to cover wear and tear and needs new calking as things are getting a tad mildewy in parts. But wall-to-wall windows and views make it worth it. Do not expect friendliness from this host. Its all business and expect no accommodation to your needs. Seems cagey to be directed to a coffee shop to NOT meet someone and be given directions but never be given an address your entire stay. I get being careful, but this borders on paranoid. Once you get the directions via text, they are detailed and concise. BE SURE to have your cellphone and What's App installed or you will be in trouble. Great coffee shops all-around and convenient markets for basics you can see from the balcony. Dinner at Osteria Lucio was beyond convenient and I recommend it. Do yourself a favor and get to Paulie's Pizza one night. A short walk opposite of city center from the apartment and you'll thank me."
5995991,436522980,4/13/2019,Very cool place and great location!
5995991,438702477,4/17/2019,Its a nice and clean place. The host was friendly and responsive. We received all the necessary instructions and information before we arrived.

5995991,460838560,5/30/2019,"This place is amazing, had an awesome view and the Host was extremely nice! If youre planning a trip to Dublin, this is where you want to stay."
5995991,463900055,6/4/2019,"The views from this apartment were absolutely amazing. There are windows everywhere! The electric blinds worked well, but they are not very dark so it does get light when the sun starts to come up. The noise from the road below is noticeable, even with the windows closed, so if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. The location was great, we walked everywhere from here. The restaurant just across the street (Charlotte Quay) was very good. The apartment looks luxurious, but it just didn't feel that way. We had some trouble getting the windows closed because they were slightly open when we arrived and it was like a wind tunnel in the apartment. It had more of a corporate apartment vibe than someone's home and there were not any of the amenities that we have experienced in other places we have stayed (a few tea bags, some sugar, coffee). For the price, I expected a bit more than what we got."
5995991,465682625,6/8/2019,"Enjoyed our stay. I think I would choose to stay closer to town.  If you have your own vehicle, parking isn't that great of an option. The views are spectacular I must say. It's hard to travel with 5 people and everyone enjoy a hot shower...but everything was clean so we were happy :)"
5995991,469884940,6/15/2019,"Great location, lots of little cafes and restaurants nearby."
5995991,471414294,6/17/2019,Excellent location and views.
5995991,472964933,6/20/2019,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5995991,473164038,6/21/2019,This is a really nice apartment. The check in process is a bit strange as you are never actually given the address throughout the stay. Still able to find it easy enough. The place is clean and the host is very responsive. The temperature was the main issue. It is June and the master bedroom was brutally hot all day and night. There is not air conditioning or much ventilation so the only way to keep cool is open the slider door in the living room. The windows do not open. We had two fans pointed at us (blowing hot air around) in order to sleep. One of the showers only has hot water. All in all a fine place except that it was way too hot.
5995991,476065717,6/25/2019,"Fantastic location in heart of Grand Canal near theatre and great restaurants. Easy walking into central Dublin.  Apartment very stylish, comfortable and immaculately clean."
5995991,480259075,7/2/2019,Great location and beautiful and stylish space. It is located about 1 mile or two away from the busy city center. We liked it as it was very quite and peaceful and the views were so beautiful. There is plenty of space in the apartment. There are also some places to eat in walking distance as well as a grocery store. We love the balcony overlooking the water. If there was a bistro set out there it would be a very nice touch. Overall we had a good stay. If you have your own car it is expensive to park in the deck across the street. We paid 80 euros for two nights. If this would blow your budget you may want to look for another alternative. We enjoyed having a washing machine and a place to cook breakfast. Nice place.
5995991,486944311,7/13/2019,"We had a great stay here in Dublin. It's located in an upscale modern area about 10-15 min. outside the City Center. There's a grocery store, coffee shops and restaurants all in that area, making it easy for our family to get essentials that we need. Going in, we expected the space to be a little tight since it is a high rise apartment, after all. As others mentioned, the rooms can get extremely stuffy. Opening the windows let in a cool breeze, however one of the room's windows was bolted so it could not be opened and we had to use the fans to help us sleep. Also, as others mentioned, the check in process was strange. I understand the desire to keep the location classified, but the process seemed like we were following a treasure map, while dragging along a ton of luggage. Despite that, the place was extremely clean and while it was not necessarily walking distance into the City, the bus stop is close to the apartment, making it easy to use our pass to get in and out. Overall, we would stay here again."
5995991,487804927,7/14/2019,Fabulous apartment in a great location. Would definitely return.
5995991,491586144,7/20/2019,Great apartment! Thank you so much for your hospitality.
5995991,498871861,7/30/2019,"Rude attitude by the host (Adam), he received us with the AirPods in his ears, walked in front of us few meters away  without saying anything.
We were told that our apartment had a problem one hour before our check in and that the new apartment would be more comfortable and modern Than the other one, however the quality was inferior and the extra beds were uncomfortable, the plumbing system in the bathrooms wasnt working properly too. The price stayed the same"
5995991,508710278,8/13/2019,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. The location is great. It's a 20 minute walk to the city centre and there are lots of great restaurants in the area. The view is absolutely incredible (lovely view over the harbour and over Sillicon Docks, where all the big tech companies are located).
However, there were some issues with the apartment. It was not that clean and is not that well maintained, with lots of (small) things broken or in a rather shabby state.
The host (Adam) was kind and when we told him our issues with the apartment he was very understanding and said he would make sure they will be fixed soon.
So if indeed the issues will be fixed, I would definitely recommend this apartment."
5995991,532293046,9/19/2019,"Not a great airbnb experience for us, we would not stay here again. In short, the apartment was dirty, wasn't properly stocked with soap and towels, a lot of things in the apartment are broken, and they changed the keypad to a keyed lock in the middle of our stay. 

The photos in the add must be from when the apartment was brand new. It looks very clean in the photo and it not nearly that clean in real life. 

The couch from the photos is not the couch in the apartment. The couch that is there is black and the add calls it a ""sofa bed"" and it is not. It does open up, but it looks like part of it is missing because it doesn't turn into a bed. 

The add says "" all towels and toiletries"" and ours had shampoo and conditioner but no soap in the bathroom. 

The master bedroom shower has mold in it. I did not look at the other shower. The master bedroom carpet is dirty and matted. It looks like the water tank or washer has leaked at some point and ruined the carpet and it has not been replaced. 

There was a thick layer of dust in a lot of areas, especially the vents. So much so that dust would fall from the bathroom exhaust vent when it was turned on. 

The window in the guest bedroom does not open at all. We asked about that and were told that it indeed does not open and they are waiting on a replacement for it. That is a problem when it is really hot during the day like it was during our stay. One of the windows in the living area does not open properly and has duct tape around it. 

During our stay, we came home to a random beeping noise throughout the apartment. We thought it was the alarm panel so we text the host, who told us it was probably the curtains, which are on a remote. It was the curtains, and the only solution to stop the beeping was to flip the breaker that controlled the curtains, which we did. We were not offered to have that fixed during our stay. 

Also during our stay, I was contacted by the owner who said they wanted to come and change our key pad on the door to a regular keyed lock. After initially telling them we would be gone for the day,  I immediately text back and asked if they could just wait until our stay was over to do that because the key pad was more convenient for us. We had different people in our group that came and went at different times and we didn't to have to keep up with physical keys and risk losing them. That request was ignored and the keypad was changed to a keyed lock anyway. They left 4 keys for us in a broken and unlocked mailbox in the building entryway."
5995991,532769075,9/20/2019,Fantastic flat with awesome views in a very up and coming neighborhood.  Easy check in/out  process. Plenty of room for two couples. Would highly recommend this to any visiting the Dublin area. Car park is available within walking distance.
6001077,421003388,3/8/2019,Very nice place.  Really was a wonderful stay
6001077,425508994,3/18/2019,"The host, Matt, was very rude and not welcoming at all. He was patronising and had his ear phones in the whole time and couldnt take his eyes off his phone while talking to us, which I consider to be very rude. The only nice thing he said all weekend was please leave a great reviewù when we left. It lists there is a gym, pool and hot tub, which isnt completely true as they are in a completely different complex about 5 miles away.. That was one of the main selling points for us so was very disappointed to find out it wasnt really the case.

Apartment was really good, slightly dirty in the bathrooms. Great location. Blinds were pretty useless, might as well had not been any. Limited hot water in the showers."
6001077,491435023,7/20/2019,"This apartment is in an amazing location right beside a lot of good restaurants and bars and easy walking into city centre.

The structure of the apartment is great with giant floor to ceiling windows and a balcony.

However the apartment is looking and feeling a bit tired with many scrapes and marks, there are some floor standing fans put in which is great as due to all of the windows the apartment is warm and the master bedroom window no longer opens to let in fresh air.

There is a problem with the remote control window blinds where putting them up or down in one bedroom does the same in the other bedroom so when sharing best to coordinate with the other guests.

The window in the second bedroom doesn't close properly which is maybe why the other room has been bolted closed.

All in its an amazing location but the apartment is tired and could do with some investment and TLC."
6001195,427900579,3/24/2019,A great apartment with good views of you are looking for something clean and contemporary for a weekend break. Priced competitively.
6001195,432977448,4/5/2019,Very Stylish apartment. Absolutely above your expectation.
6001195,436171666,4/12/2019,The location was great! Host was very quick to answer questions. Close to everything that we wanted to do. Eateries right outside of the building! The view was great! I locked myself out of the building and they were quick to respond and get me access less than 10 min after calling. Highly recommend this place!
6001195,440235233,4/20/2019,The host canceled this reservation 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6001195,445454303,4/29/2019,"Great, bright, modern apartment in an interesting part of town near great restaurants and the theater and a short walk to almost every other part of Dublin you may want to go to."
6001195,460525153,5/29/2019,Good space.  Host had someone come to the apartment when we had trouble working out the heating/air-conditioning.
6001195,469202582,6/14/2019,Good location and a nicely laid out apartment.
6001195,475519418,6/24/2019,Great views and location!
6003187,431760410,4/1/2019,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6003187,468012020,6/11/2019,Really nice location and everything you need for your stay in Dublin. You can reach the city centre by foot in about 10mins. Angela is a really nice host. Fully recommend.
6003269,434676143,4/8/2019,"Andreas place is greatîclean, cozy, and stylish. She provides so many great recommendations for things to do in the city (with specifics for each so you dont have to do a ton of googling before narrowing down the options), information on nearest shops and grocery stores, and was so easy and helpful to communicate with from the day we arrived. Its a bit of a walk to the south side of the city but we managed it easily every day! A great place to stay in Dublin thats affordable and feels like home."
6003269,435739707,4/11/2019,"This is a very well located apartment for all the major attractions of the city, just a few minutes walk to Capel Street and Temple Bar. The bed was comfy and we found the entry instructions clear. There is a really nice cafe for quality coffee and breakfast downstairs. Would recommend for two."
6003269,437258010,4/14/2019,"I have to say, I was very excited about staying here, and it simply did not live up to my expectations. Andrea was very communicative and understanding, but didnt provide a satisfactory response to the fact that she lied about there being a hot tub in the property, Im sorry, but in no world does a bath count as a hot tub and this is not made clear in the comments. This property is expensive, even for Dublin but is not in the city centre and I have never said this before when staying in an air Bnb but I think a hotel wouldve been better (and cheaper) in this case. There was nothing overly wrong with the property, it is well kept, but it feels dated and it is quite cramped, we spent a lot of money on coming to stay here as a birthday surprise and were left severely disappointed as we had much higher expectations. I just think that several things couldve been done a lot better, I certainly have high standards though, and this is a fine place to spend a couple of nights in Dublin. I have nothing against Andrea as she is a lovely host but I am afraid that I feel my experience was very sub par."
6003269,438724370,4/17/2019,"I loved it! Andrea is very quick to respond, and the house guide was LOVELY and helpful for planning our day trips from Dublin. The place was cozy. Would come back!!"
6003269,447254175,5/3/2019,"Andrea's cosy apartment is exactly like in the pictures - perfectly cosy, clean and only a 2-minute-walk away from one of the main streets with many places to go out, go shopping or just to get to many bus or train possibilities as well. The apartment was perfectly prepared when we arrived - even some tea and milk was already prepared (thank you for that! ;) ).
We will definitely come back once we're planning on visiting Dublin again - which we definitely will! :)"
6003269,449242415,5/6/2019,"A very clean, cosy place in a brilliant location for exploring the city."
6003269,450411853,5/9/2019,This place is cute and quaint. It's got everything you need with nothing you don't. Andrea is a wonderful host...I especially appreciated the timely responses to messages and all the great food recommendations. Be sure to go down the street to Jay's Cafe for an A+ scone! 
6003269,451953169,5/12/2019,My husband and I were very happy with Andrea's apartment. It was very clean and her bed linens smelled like they just came out the wash! Most places I question the last time they were cleaned. Everything worked properly. The wifi worked well. Andrea was attentive to our questions. It's a fair walking distance to city center or the new commuter rail is near by if you're not up for walking. Even the bar across the street wasn't too loud- at night shutting the bedroom door kept the noise out. Our only dislike was the hallway smells like sour trash all the time so maybe the people who take care of the building can do something? Overall it was a very good experience there.
6003269,453301380,5/15/2019,"Cute, comfortable, clean place not too far from many sites in Dublin. Fantastic local tips!"
6003269,455903145,5/20/2019,"Andrea's place was fab. Great location, clean and looked great. Plus all her local tips were really handy and spot on! Would definetely recommend"
6003269,456773414,5/22/2019,We had a great stay!
6003269,458694620,5/26/2019,Beautiful apartment and the location was excellent. We were very close to everyone we wanted to see. Andrea was very hospitable during our stay.
6003269,461389878,5/31/2019,Andreas place was in a great location and was exactly what we were expecting! We struggled a bit with finding the check in instructions but Andrea was very helpful in instructing us to find the keys.
6003269,463361073,6/3/2019,"Amazing place with a comfy bed and a  great location only 15 mins walk from temple bar. Quirky and cosy apartment with a pub opposite if you dont want to venture too far. Andreas a great host, providing tones of Information about Dublin tours and the best restaurants. Would highly recommend and cant wait to return!"
6003269,468323509,6/12/2019,"A wonderful stay at a unit as described by host. Bright, comfortable, attractively decorated apartment. Outside the Center City but readily accessible to many attractions  by walking. Kitchen has all needed items  and extra food incidentals are stocked. Washer and dryer  combo an added welcomed feature. Host leaves a detailed guide to area restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet except at night  the bar across the street can be heard. This noise does not extend into the bedroom in the rear so a peaceful nights sleep is possible. Heed the hosts note of apartment being on second floor (two up from ground floor). We are 68yo and found no problem walking up and down the stairs....but hauling  my large luggage piece up the narrow stairway curves proved to be  a challenge."
6003269,472667058,6/20/2019,Andreas proper apparent is very well located so you can reach the city by foot or by tram. Thanks to her recommendations we found perfect places to eat in the neighborhood. Very good place  for a stay right in the city of Dublin!
6003269,484053671,7/8/2019,"Andreas place was great! It was easy to walk to most everything, and she left detailed suggestions for places to go for food, which we greatly appreciated. The apartment was very cute and perfect for two people."
6003269,486352126,7/12/2019,Such a beautiful apartment in a great location! Excellent recommendations of places to see and eat as well! Thank you!
6003269,490243581,7/18/2019,"We had a good stay at the apartment, which is well decorated with anything you'd need. Andrea also gave a very comprehensive guide for places in the city which was quite useful."
6003269,499371060,7/31/2019,"My sister and I stayed at Andreas place this past summer of 2019. Andreas place is exactly as described! It is clean, cute, bright, and beautiful!! The pictures and location description on this site are very accurate. My sister and I were able to easily walk to city centre, or transportation stops. We did have a bit of a bad experience trying to check in to the apartment. Andrea had accidentally given us the wrong lock-box confirmation. As two visitors from a different country, without WiFi we had no way to contact her. We were able to take refuge and get WiFi in the cute pub across the street. But after reaching out to Andrea, it was quite some time before we heard back from her. we ended up just trying different combinations of the 4 numbers in the original code and were able to figure it out. Once Andrea did respond, she was very apologetic. We understand that it was just a mistake, but it was still very inconvenient and ended up consuming most of our first day in Dublin. However, after that initial mishap, we had a completely AMAZING trip! Andrea checked in several times to make sure that we were enjoying our stay. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at Andreas apartment! It is fairly price and very worth the money."
6003269,505393956,8/9/2019,It is a beautiful little Parisian getaway in a great area of Dublin
6003269,508709369,8/13/2019,Precioso apartamento muy bien ubicado.
6003269,510013933,8/15/2019,Centrally located and well equipped - we really enjoyed our time at Andreas place. Andrea was very accomodating and gave us some great tips about the area. Highly recommend.
6003269,514416840,8/21/2019,"Clean apartment and very much like described. It is very centrally located, so we were able to walk to everything in the city. Andrea gave us some very nice food suggestions. I can recommend Brother Hubbards (good for lunch and fair prices) and Chapter One (Michelin star restaurant, so quite expensive, but their pre-theatre menus are very! reasonable priced). 
We would love to come back another time and use Andreas apartment again."
6003269,518332007,8/26/2019,"Andrea's place has everything you need for a wonderful weekend - especially appreciated the fresh ground coffee and super comfortable bed.

The location next to the tram line makes it a perfect hub for a weekend of exploring Dublin"
6003269,524162634,9/5/2019,Clean and very well appointed. On Tram line and bus was 2 blocks away. We walked to Trinity college from the apartment.
6003269,530705441,9/16/2019,"Andrea was so easy to communicate with, in a great location, and the decor was beautiful!"
6003269,532716229,9/20/2019,"Andreas apartment is a cozy spot in a fantastic location. It is an easy walk to the center of everything or a quick walk to the tram stop if youd rather use that option. She was quick with responses as well. Directions to accessing the apartment/finding the key box to enter/etc takes a few reads to try and understand, but the pictures she provides do help a little. Super cozy bed! Overall, a lovely, very enjoyable experience!"
6003269,535344133,9/24/2019,Andreas place is very nice and cozy. It is a short walk from the city center and all pubs. The bed was very comfy and the apartment itself is very warm!! Andrea was very nice and left a bunch of useful recommendations for food. Thank you so much for your hospitality!
6003269,536632677,9/27/2019,"Very clean, very nice flat with walking distance of everything downtown. I really enjoyed my stay."
6003269,539380163,10/1/2019,Nice and clean appartment located centrally in North Inner City
6018062,419583890,3/4/2019,"Rae is a fantastic host, who is very attentive and great company. The room and house were both lovely and the place felt like home for us for the few days we were there. There is a delicious breakfast of toast, coffee, fruit and spreads in the morning and always a good conversation with Rae!"
6018062,421995406,3/10/2019,"I cant say enough wonderful things about Raes place! It was so sweet and what we imagined staying in a true Irish home would be like!  Everything was absolutely perfect. He had thought of all the details. The place is beautifully decorated! Has a great amount of space and was sparkling clean. Rae was so great with giving directions and helping us out when needed! He even went above and beyond to walk us to a place to help get our phones sorted out. Its location is great! Its only a short 15ish minutes bus ride to the area of Dublin when all the tourist activities are like St.Patricks, Temple Bar, Guinness Store Front and many others. Included with our stay was a breakfast! Breakfast was always wonderful and Rae told us lots of information about Ireland! If you are looking for a amazing place to stay for your trip to Dublin, then  look no further! Rae truly is a super host!"
6018062,424210961,3/16/2019,"This was our very first experience in the Air bb world Rae is the perfect host, he went above and beyond on accommodations, suggestions. Being helpful an attentive is an understatement he made the first leg our time in Ireland most comfortable along with a great experience 5 stars for Rae"
6018062,428541313,3/25/2019,"Simply the best ! Rae was the perfect host for our first time in Dublin : very professional indeed, but most of all a very nice person who never hesitates to give some visiting advices, has so many stories to tell, and is an attentive person by nature.
Moreover the house is beautiful and very confortable, we really felt like home on this journey.
So if you're looking for some great human experience while going to Dublin, I would warmly recommend you to contact Rae."
6018062,433906599,4/7/2019,"We loved staying here and especially getting to know Rae. His home is full of charm. 

We took the bus into the town center (but I would say it is walkable if the weather is nice. Be sure to have exact change in coins! The bus drivers can be grumpy, haha. It is 3 euro per person, one way.) Rae gave us a map of the city which we used frequently, and he also gave us a 20% off coupon for the Guinness Factory - which we also used! The coupon says it must be used by 11 am, but we went around 12:30 pm and they accepted it : )  We also went to the National Archaeology Museum and the Natural History museum (close to one another) and I tell you, these are hidden gems that I think most people skip! (Lucky us? Haha, there are no lines to wait in.) The Archaeology one has treasures and finds from thousands of years ago that I honestly have not seen anywhere else in any of the other capitals we've visited, and especially not in these quantities or so well-preserved. The collection is so unique. 

Rae's home is a great place to begin a leisurely start to the day - this was one of those weekend trips where we came without a plan and wandered everywhere. If we had planned a little better we would have walked over to Drumnagh Castle, which is nearby. It closes early on Fridays but you can still see the outside - we learned a lot about local history, traditions, and culture from Rae. He's a collector of interesting tidbits and memorable facts, if you mention what you're interested in he'll tell you all about it! We loved chatting over breakfast and we had a grand time :)!"
6018062,443562275,4/26/2019,This house and the interior is pretty awesome and the choosen furniture is quite extraordinary. It was a really good choice to go there!
6018062,444656728,4/28/2019,"Great location, easy access to downtown Dublin. Beautiful home full of unique touches. Enjoyed breakfast and banter with Murray. She was lovely with many helpful insights."
6018062,452573299,5/13/2019,"A very nice place to stay in Dublin. Rooms are very nice and cozy, especially the bathroom. If you like you can have a small breakfast and take a coffe in the lovely garden. The hosts are very hospitable and lets you feel comfortable.
A small but important detail, there are USB plugs near the bed.
The accommodation is outside of the center of Dublin, but good connected by public bus."
6018062,457975148,5/25/2019,Friendly and helpful host
6018062,459423350,5/27/2019,Our overall stay at Raes was good. It was further from the main attractions than we were expecting.
6018062,460475514,5/29/2019,Raes place is great. Walking distance to town and nice cosy place to stay. Best part is Rae and his wife who are genuinely lovely people who went above and beyond to make us feel comfy and at home. Can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin
6018062,461795308,6/1/2019,"This is a great place to stay! Rae gave a lot great information about how to get to his place and into the city using the bus system. The Airbnb is about 10/15 min outside of the city, but plenty of bus routes cross by his house so it was easy to get in and out of the city. Overall highly recommend!"
6018062,463893049,6/4/2019,"Rae is laid back and has time to chat, give advice as needed, and when i had an issue with my car he was so helpful.  I saved hundreds of euro as a result.  Rae is restoring two old volvos!"
6018062,471324390,6/17/2019,"Rae is a great host, always willing to help. He gave us great Dublin tips and places to meet outside the tourist route of the city. The stories he told us over breakfast were also great and will remain in our memories. Rae's house is very well maintained and very cozy. We stayed in the upstairs bedroom which is a good size. The bed is great. The bathroom is spacious and the shower very good and with good pressure. There is a water heating system that you need to wait about 20 minutes between the baths for the water to warm up again. We stayed there for 10 days and felt like at home. We have so much to thank Rae. The title of superhost is very well deserved."
6018062,471804629,6/18/2019,A hidden gem in Dublin! Stayed on work travel and it was just superb
6018062,474559806,6/23/2019,Perfect for a relaxed Dublin City trip!
6018062,484151266,7/8/2019,"Rae's place was perfect! great location, close to downtown, just a few blocks from the bus with car parking also available. his home was perfectly and uniquely decorated. loved the bathroom and garden in particular! he had coffee, tea, toast, butter and jam available for breakfast and was always hospitable and available to talk or with a word of advice on things we wanted to do. great way to start our Ireland vacation. thanks Rae!"
6018062,486199028,7/12/2019,Raes place was absolutely lovely. It was the most comfortable place & felt like home :) He was a great host & the space was so wonderful in a quiet area. Would highly recommend to anyone going to visit Dublin!!
6018062,492520086,7/21/2019,"Highly recommended for anyone wanting to stay within the easiest reach of Dublin - buses running every few minutes to and from the heart of the city. 

Rae's wonderfully furnished house of art, craft and quirky vintage pieces made it a most interesting place to stay. 

Muraed was the perfect hospitable  stand-in host, making us welcome and comfortable - sharing the kitchen and outside spaces, available to help with local guidance."
6018062,497078319,7/28/2019,"Rae's place is beautiful and obviously very well thought out. We didn't get to meet Ray but his friend Muraed was very nice and inviting. We loved staying in the house. However, there are a couple of things that would have been good to know upfront. When other guests arrived it turned out the sound easily travels through the floors. Also, turning the heater on for the shower is something that needs to be planned in advance. And you'll spend extra time and money traveling from and to the city centre.

In short: if you're looking for a super quiet and luxurious stay close to the city, this may not be it - but if you're on a budget and looking for a comfortable place outside the city centre, Rae's place is perfect :-)"
6018062,503741557,8/6/2019,You will find a little paradise in a big town.
6018062,505388868,8/9/2019,Rae's home was quiet and very comfortable.  We certainly felt welcomed and at home.
6018062,510043604,8/15/2019,"We spent two nights at rae's lovely house.  We were welcomed very hospitably, the communication was excelent and everything was perfect.
Highly recommended."
6018062,515814746,8/23/2019,"Such a beautifully style home. Would recommend to anyone. 

Muraed was an excellent and welcoming host! :)"
6018062,517218902,8/25/2019,"Raes place is a charming cottage stay just outside the heart of Dublin.  Exceptionally clean, well taken care of with darling personal touches, its quiet but not far from all amenities and attractions. Its easily accessible by all transportation methods. Everything I wanted an Irish cottage to be."
6018062,522578082,9/2/2019,"My partner and I stayed at Rae's place for 3 nights.
Rae was a formidable host. He gave us great recommendations about things to do in the city. He is a very friendly and interesting person and we had great discussions with him.
The house was well located (~45min walking distance from the city center) and very clean.
If needs be, we would stay again at Rae's place without any hesitation and we would recommend anyone to do so."
6018062,535473561,9/24/2019,To be welcomed by a passionate person
6018062,535842037,9/25/2019,Raes place is super. Cool and quirky house but most of all a generous and kind host. Full of stories and local knowledge and really helpful on getting around Dublin. Highly recommended
6018062,539836938,10/2/2019,"Wonderful experience at Rae's lovely house!
It's cozy, clean, convenient, with everything needed for a travelling stay. The location is a bit suburb but quite near the bus stop. Since Dublin is actually not huge, it is not very faraway from the city center, like less than 30min bus ride. 
Rae gives detailed instruction for the stay as well as for our tour in Dublin. His recommended restaurants all turned out to be nice places. 
The most highlight is Rae's artistic interior design with many his own nice handcraft as well as many collections of good old things. He also maintains his lovely yard with sweet rasberries, his studio for all sorts of handcrafts and also his passionate antique car and motorcycle collections (and reinventions)! we even took a pic with the most retro-style Volvo. Highly r ecommend to everyone who wants to have an interesting experience beyond just a place to sleep!"
6018062,541511230,10/5/2019,"This beautiful and extraordinary accommodation was absolutely one of our tops. 
The room was furnished with a lot of lovely details and we directly felt home. Everything was very clean and in shape. 
The hosts Rae and Rosa were so heartily and kind. 
Rae welcomed us and show us around. 
The house is so cute and fully equipped. We didnt miss anything. Several buses are in a short distance and it takes you not too long to get to the center.  
Rae was so concerned about our well being that we felt like visiting a friend. We highly recommend this place and if we ever get to ireland again well surely stay at Raes"
6018062,543278569,10/7/2019,Rae was a lovely host and his house was very clean and cosy! An easy and short bus trip into the centre of Dublin. I would highly recommend a stay at Raes!
6018062,545981385,10/13/2019,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay. Its located in a quiet neighbourhood and it was quick and easy for us to get to and from the city center by bus. Rae gave us a lot of advice for getting around Dublin and places to visit. We really appreciated the friendliness and hospitality and enjoyed getting to know Rae. Would highly recommend and would certainly stay here again!
6018062,547566309,10/15/2019,"I had a wonderful time staying at Rae's. He is an excellent host who accommodated an early check in, replied quickly to messages and provided a map with plenty of advice about the area and tips for how to get around the city more quickly. The rain head shower was worth the price to stay alone and I'd be delighted to stay in Rae's stylish, well decorated home again."
6018062,548280939,10/17/2019,Rae's home is a uniquely Irish experience. He has lovingly restored his place and now shares it with his guests. Rae has a wealth of information about Dublin and is a gracious host.
6018062,557621218,11/1/2019,"Rae was a grand host, very informative, welcoming and friendly, his place is meticulously decorated with antique and handmade pieces that made you feel like you went back in time. Rae's place is close enough to town that you can walk, we did several times, it catch the bus for a quick ride. We will seek this host out again when we are able to get back to Dublin."
6018062,560334750,11/6/2019,"Rae was an amicable, lovely host with such a beautiful home and garden. It was a pleasure to stay with him, get a thorough run down of local sites, and chat over tea and toast. We hope to see him again on another trip!"
6024345,495095752,7/25/2019,"Superb alternative to a hotel. Close to lots of amenities, 2 minute walk to the Luas, and easy to get up into the Dublin mountains."
6024345,500033831,8/1/2019,"Terrific place. Was there for business. Quiet location. Aldi 5 minutes walk and the tram to Dublin 3 minutes walk and 30 minutes ride. 

Spotlessly clean and minimalist.  Excellent!"
6024345,503578359,8/6/2019,Functioneel en behoorlijk ok
6027743,419005087,3/3/2019,Paul's place is great! I definitely recommend staying if you're planning on visiting Dublin.
6027743,425458890,3/18/2019,"Paul's place is located just a short walk from the city center and is perfect if you're working near Grand Canal Square. One of the airport shuttles stops less than a 5 min. walk away and there is a small supermarket crossing the street which makes it comfortable. If you check in during the specified hours there will be someone to meet you, so there is no need to do the self check-in."
6027743,431961086,4/2/2019,This apartment is in a great location. It's about a 15 minute walk from the city centre. There's a SPAR grocery store just across the street which was very convenient for buying groceries. The place was very clean when we arrived and was nice for our stay!
6027743,434714336,4/8/2019,"Nice appartment, central and quiet. Communication with Paul was easy and quick. I recommend this place."

6027743,436056439,4/12/2019,"We stayed two nights at Pauls appartement. His friend left us the key in a safe box with all the information and photos to locate it easily. It was really convenient for us because our flight was a bit delayed.

The appartement is well located in a quiet area, all clean, tidy and with all the equipment you might need (hair dryer, domestic iron, washing machine, ..).

I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at Pauls place to enjoy a good trip in Dublin!"
6027743,444158881,4/27/2019,"Paul is a very good and attentive host.
The apartment is very well situated in Dublin close to the docklands and the city centre.

6027743,459325458,5/27/2019,Paul is a great communicator.  My many questions were answered almost immediately.  The apartment is an a great location .. we walked everywhere.  We also like the fact that there was a Spar Grocery store at the end of the street.
6027743,460428807,5/29/2019,Great experience - everything was smooth and place was clean
6027743,462565354,6/2/2019,"Paul was a great host.  The check in process was super easy and his location is right near the bus stop for the bus that takes you to the airport.  So super convenient. 

He was also very thoughtful in providing us a pack n play for our baby.  That was very helpful.  

Great host overall and wed definitely recommend staying with Paul."
6027743,466392702,6/9/2019,Good place to stay for shorter trips if traveling party comprises of adults only and do not plan to cook much. Secure and convenient  location.

6027743,476053176,6/25/2019,"Comfortable bed, good shower. Has balcony, intercom and microwave. Excellent location very close to town short walk away with amenities nearby. Little misunderstanding regarding location and check-in but host refunded me taxi fare which I thought was very good of him."
6027743,476877764,6/27/2019,"Pauls place is in a nice quiet location. Just a few minutes from a bus stop that can take you from and to the airport directly.
Sparking clean space with a great view to the outsides."
6027743,478637048,6/30/2019,The place is well described and a wonderful stay for us. Located near the main attractions.
6027743,485230476,7/10/2019,"The location was very good, all the main things were within walking distance. Paul was accommodating with our check-in time and getting the keys was convenient. Place is clean and cozy, equipped well to allow us to cook there as well!"
6027743,488658014,7/15/2019,"Paul's place was perfect for my business trip. Located on the 5th floor of an apartment building with an elevator, it was quiet, convenient, and located walking distance to my office along Grand Canal. There are convenice stores, restaurants, pubs within minutes walking distance. Reliable wifi, clean bathroom, and washing machine were all great!"
6027743,493957667,7/23/2019,"This is a great little flat in a lovely area - close enough to centre that nothing feels far away but far enough that you arent surrounded by tourists. The Merrion square is right there which is a gorgeous park and lots of great cafes. 

Paul was quick to reply and provided a cot and big hair which was a great help"
6027743,495101482,7/25/2019,Great place. Couldnt have asked for better
6027743,502043357,8/4/2019,"Clean and quiet. A great place to come

6027743,505571026,8/9/2019,Great stay at Paul's place. Everything was perfect.
6027743,509852729,8/15/2019,"Pauls place was great! The apartment was super clean and spacious.  Check in was very simple with the lock box and Paul checked in with us to make sure everything was okay once we got there and if we needed anything.  The apartment building was in a great location and was very quiet.  The bed was spacious and comfortable.  There were plenty of towels, pillows and an extra comforter under the couch.  While I did not use the kitchen it was stocked well with plates, cups and silverware.  I did use the washing machine and it worked great! No dryer but I hung my clothes up and that worked just fine.  I would definitely recommend Pauls place to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable stay in Dublin."
6027743,517442427,8/25/2019,"Great flat in a quieter part of Dublin but only a 15/20min walk to city centre, plenty of buses, taxis or city bikes at the end of the street.  Sparkling clean, spotless bedding, well equipped, sofa bed very comfy for our 6ft son. Paul very kindly arranged an earlier check in time due to our earlier than expected arrival time, very accommodating and responsive to all our enquiries, offered local information. We would highly recommend this accommodation and location, near the canal, within short walking distance of some great eating places around the Grand Canal area, highly recommend (Website hidden by Airbnb) and HQ, great food and service. The sun shone, had a great stay in Dublin."
6027743,524698718,9/6/2019,"Perfect location.  Clean, bright, quiet, and includes every amenity one might need.  Hosts are very easy to communicate with. Recommend this apartment to anyone coming to Dublin!"
6027743,526614275,9/9/2019,Can't recommend this flat enough - Paul was super helpful in all his messages and the flat itself was great. Fab location and has everything you could need!
6027743,528016933,9/12/2019,Paul's place is super convenient location wise and is right next to many of the tech offices near by - great for a work trip! The place was spotless and had all the basic amenities you need. Everything worked well and the check in was easy and very clear. I would absolutely stay again when traveling to Dublin.
6027743,531856461,9/18/2019,"I would highly recommend this spot to any of my friends and family. The apartment is a great home base for tourism or working. It's an easy 15 minute walk to Trinity College and to any of the tech offices. The space was clean and cozy and checking out was also a breeze. Thanks, Paul!"
6027743,541420658,10/5/2019,Paul's place is great. It is very centrally located and easy to get to and from. There are good coffee shops nearby. Most of all the apartment is very clean with great new appliances.
6027743,544864044,10/11/2019,"This is a cute and quiet apartment, but very basic. It needs upgrading (hooks in bath, drain cover, paper products, blackout drapes and extras) to justify the price."
6027743,548253235,10/17/2019,"Check in directions were a little spotty but once you got into the apartment, it was exactly as described. Thanks for hosting!"
6027743,551558488,10/20/2019,Great stay in a quiet neighbourhood but still only a short walk away from the city centre.
6050566,562101385,11/10/2019,"the stay went perfectly. the apartment is on top, big, clean in the heart of dublin. I advise him. Thanks brian!"
6096885,525987622,9/8/2019,"Lovely room, lovely home, lovely host. 
Mary made me feel very welcome and could not have been kinder. Highly recommended."
6100075,418981379,3/3/2019,We had a great weekend & the apartment was in the perfect position for walking to everywhere. we didnt have great weather so we caught taxis. The apartment was just what we needed - it was quirky with 2 bedrooms in the ceiling space. Denise was very helpful and her husband. Thank you
6100075,421871570,3/10/2019,This is a cute apartment in a great location for exploring Dublin.
6100075,426244767,3/20/2019,"Located around a 20 minute walk from the centre, the apartment is located in a strategic location for exploration of the city. 

Apartment was adequate for 2-4 guests, but not the sort of place you could spend a lazy morning, but then Dublin isn't that kinda city! Great little cafe on the corner which does amazing breakfast, and make our Lidl groceries redundant. 

There are some niggles which have been recommended for improvement."
6100075,430894114,3/31/2019,Excellent stay at a lovely apartment!
6100075,440197783,4/20/2019,Denise's place is lovely. It's very centrally located and definitely a home away from home. We had such an amazing time in Dublin. The special touches of breakfast food was lovely as well. We will be back soon!
6100075,442716627,4/24/2019,I've been travelling with airbnb for over 6 years now and Denise brings back the BNB to what hardly ever is offered any more.  She provided a kitchen which was well stocked with staples to let you immediately set up house - we were even able to cook up a breakfast our first morning without going to a store.  The lodging is conveniently close to busy O'Connell Street and walking to and from there is easy and safe.  Just a word of caution though about wandering further to the east or south-east from there - it gets sketchy fairly quickly.
6100075,444834658,4/28/2019,Very nice little place close to the city! Denise is a really nice hostess.
6100075,448515021,5/5/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay and the city. Everything you need was in the apartment, and a lot of extras (like fresh fruit, a full refrigerator, and all kinds of shampoos etc.) The location is perfect, since everything is in walking distance. The only con was the thin walls and noise of the water pump, which gave us some problems sleeping."
6100075,451956811,5/12/2019,Amazing! A good 10 min walk out of town but totally worth it to have a bit of space and such a great host!
6100075,457587264,5/24/2019,"Denise was amazing. We had a great time, place is in a great location and we walked everywhere. Cant wait to come back."
6100075,460883171,5/30/2019,"Very nice place, hosts are friendly and helpful."
6100075,462470627,6/2/2019,Great apartment with character in great location. Compact space but fine for our group of 3.Used sofa bed which was very comfy. Great communication- quick to respond to any queries. 10 mins walk from Dublin City centre so ideal base for a Dublin break.
6100075,466552682,6/9/2019,Had a lovely stay here. Denise was great. Would definitely recommend!
6100075,476093997,6/25/2019,Denise's place is stylish and in a perfect location.  I highly recommend it!!
6100075,478989088,6/30/2019,"This is a stylish Georgian studio apartment that has been turned into a 2 bedroom apartment which is in a great location which makes it easy to access everywhere in Dublin. Denise leaves out a tonne of leaflets for her visitors to find their way around Dublin and to get the best value for their money! Denise is very flexible when it comes to being a host and is extremely generous and kind, communication between her and myself was nothing short for excellent! She has also signposted everything in her apartment to make yourself feel a little more at home from the lights, to the WiFi and to the immersion. Definitely a fantastic apartment and host for excellent value! Will definitely be looking to book here again for future experiences in Dublin!"
6100075,482219000,7/6/2019,"Denise's apartment is very cosy, clean and confortable, feels like home. Denise is so nice and full of attentions. The location is perfect, calm neighbourhood, central and near bus stop toward the city and the airport. Will surely go back there if travelling to Dublin again."
6124092,426494186,3/21/2019,Great positionwith great views over the city
6124092,429877344,3/29/2019,A lovely apartment in a great location. Really modern and enjoyable place to relax as well.
6124092,442769867,4/24/2019,there is free parking in the streets from 7pm to 7am and that the street parking is half that of the parking station. The guided tour of the Glasnevian cemetery was great. It covers the history of the making of Ireland and those that died to make it a united and independent country from England.
6124092,443571161,4/26/2019,Excellent accommodation in a great location.
6124092,444154671,4/27/2019,Breathtaking views on entering the apartment. Location 10/10. Value for 6 people outstanding. Can highly recommend.
6124092,450443184,5/9/2019,"Great views from 11th floor full length windows and balcony over the docks, and about a 15 minute walk to the City via the riverside and a few good pubs.
A few issues with the windows, but a quick call resulted in 2 fans arriving really quickly. Very modern apartment and well kitted out."
6124092,452442409,5/13/2019,"Apartment not clean, windows taped shut in bedrooms and living room.  Only one remote for all of the blinds in the apartment.  No separate one for bedrooms so all of the blinds either open or closed.    Sofa bed very uncoformable and needed a mattress.  The view was amazing which is why we close the apartment - however it is overpriced and disappointing that it wasn't clean."
6124092,457050479,5/23/2019,Apartment is in a brilliant location and the views out over Dublin are amazing. Clean apartment and Communication is excellent. Would definitely recommend to anyone and would stay again.
6124092,460512884,5/29/2019,This place has an incredible location and beautiful views.  The only downside is the description indicates there is a hot tub and this feature is not actually located on the premises; guests have access to a hot tub located offsite.
6124092,469270135,6/14/2019,The apartment was lovely and in a nice setting. Had everything we needed for our trip. 
6124092,471878857,6/18/2019,"The flat is modern but tired.  It has a fabulous view of the city,  it is well placed for the city centre and the bed linen and towels were clean. 
But, we found check-in instructions unclear - initially we were told we would meet the host at a meeting point and he would give us instructions for the flat and parking. At that time we were not told where the meeting point was and had to ask when we were actually in Dublin. The host did not meet us - we were texted a key code. No help was given about parking, a second request was ignored.
The  entry code key pad to the building was very difficult to use (needs replacing) and the flat itself needs deep cleaning and some maintenance. The fridge was quite smelly and the shower controls in the second bedroom were poor. There was no remote control for the blinds in one of the bedrooms so they could not be opened or closed. The bed had the most uncomfortable  mattress I have ever slept on.
All in all the flat served a purpose as we were only there for two nights but we found the whole experience very impersonal. We were asked for our time of  departure as soon as we crossed the threshold which left us with the feeling we were on some kind of conveyor belt."
6124092,472816124,6/20/2019,"Well located  apartment with great views over Canal area and easy walk to centre of town. modern apartment, recommened."
6124092,480270423,7/2/2019,Great location and there are lots of lovely restaurants and bars nearby. For a quieter place to stay away from the main area of Dublin.
6124092,481625411,7/5/2019,High-rise with apartment on 12th floor which appeared different than what was pictured. Windows are taped shut with duct tape thus limiting air flow except from the slider on the balcony. No furniture on balcony. Three fans in unit. We visited in early July and temperature in apartment was hot due to limited air flow. Linens clean.
6124092,484613350,7/9/2019,"Overall this apartment is BEAUTIFUL and the host was very responsive, after we had a few issues. We arrived and it wasnt cleaned properly and basic household items (dish soap, dish scrubber, etc.) were not provided. The host immediately purchased the essential items and had the unit cleaned during our stay but still wasnt up to what we were expecting. A few items advertised were slightly misleading (hot tub and gym) and not conveniently provided, which was disappointing."
6124092,487639207,7/14/2019,"It's a bit hard to locate but the location is great, we returned our car when we got there as parking is an issue. It's perfect for 4 people."
6124092,491651652,7/20/2019,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6124092,494474524,7/24/2019,"A few problems around timely responses with check-in instructions. Also no fans provided and all windows sealed, so couldnt effectively cool the unit. Great location and outlook. Well appointed."
6124092,498859823,7/30/2019,"Great location close to coffee shops, restaurants, train station, and supermarket. Bus stop just down the street. Amazing views and good space!"
6124092,506944748,8/11/2019,The place was suitable as a base to stay in which was close to the temple bar area. The apartment had fantastic views but was tired and had a lot of cobwebs and dust. The bed sheets and bathrooms were clean though.
6124092,516458306,8/24/2019,"In a great location and very modern! However, maybe cleanliness could have been dealt with better."
6124092,522526170,9/2/2019,Great apt.  and location
6124092,524714707,9/6/2019,My family and I loved staying at this place.
6124092,529760363,9/15/2019,OTTIMA POSIZIONE
6124092,548985297,10/18/2019,Great location and views but it wasnt as clean as we would expect and some basics were missing.
6124677,547936198,10/16/2019,"Well located place close to Bord Gais theater. Clean, comfortable beds."

6124677,557598337,11/1/2019,"Namestitev je odliƒçna. Vse, kar ƒçlovek potrebuje na potovanju. Lokacija namestitve je ravno tako odliƒçna. Do letali≈°ƒça je oddaljena pol ure, do centra mesta 15 min (izven prometnih konic).

6142988,424855524,3/17/2019,"Michele is an amazing host, so thoughtful, communicative and went above and beyond to help me with check in and recommendations. 
The place itself is nice and comfortable, she thought of everything and the house is clean, cozy, well situated near the train and walkable to downtown. I would stay here again and again. Thanks!"
6142988,427835273,3/24/2019,"Michele is a fantastic host who is considerate, welcoming and goes above and beyond your expectations."
6142988,435441981,4/10/2019,"If you want a perfect clean, friendly and silent house, this is what you need. Michele is the perfect guest. She waited my arrival at 2 am. 10-20 minutes to the center of the city. Easy access by tram or walk. The room is perfect for a bedroom. For all my futures visits in Dublin, this will be my first option. Thanks, Michele."
6142988,443513083,4/26/2019,Had a super stay at Michele's. She was a very thoughtful and kind host. I can highly recommend her Airbnb.

6142988,447839358,5/4/2019,"This is what the AirBnb experience should be - straightforward, easy, cost-efficient and welcoming :)"
6142988,452960454,5/14/2019,Okay.  The place looks great in pictures but its cuter and cozier in person. Michele is fantastic and all the things you would want in an Airbnb host. She will answer all your questions and leave you to do what you want.  Her home is welcoming and she keeps it spotless.  Coffee and tea and fruit are always available and she brought in fresh bread from the bakery.  Really cant say enough good stuff about her and her place.  Its a tiny little historic neighborhood of little row houses that is surrounded by lots of construction (thanks to a burgeoning tech boom) but I didnt hear any of it.  Thank you Michele for a great introduction to Dublin.
6142988,499448161,7/31/2019,"I was travelling for work to Dublin attending an intense academic conference. I stayed with Michele for my entire trip and I could not have chosen a better place! The location was perfect with a short walk to the conference venue. Michele is the epitome of an Airbnb host - kind, caring, accommodating, upbeat and always on top of everything. An early morning check-in was not a problem and greatly appreciated after a red-eye trans-Atlantic flight. My room was just as described but I would like to highlight a large and comfortable bed that you can just melt into after a full and stressful day. I also had a private 5-piece bathroom all to myself! The flat is just like Michele - inviting and warm with the cutest backyard where I ate my dinners almost everyday. I highly recommend staying with Michele at her place."
6142988,513413579,8/19/2019,"Michele was very friendly and professional. The area is quiet and quaint. Short walk to the CCD, and tram stop. If you are like me you will be glad you stayed here."
6142988,529128196,9/14/2019,Michele is a very friendly and attentative host. Her place is clean and cosy. The room is nice. I recommend a stay at Michele's place if you're travelling to Dublin!
6142988,536782238,9/27/2019,"Michele is a great host.  The place was very close to the Dublin Convention Centre, where I was having my conference.  The place is very clean and tidy.  Michele also made an extra effort to provide the breakfast you asked for.  Many thanks Michele.  I will definitely recommend it."
6142988,544876771,10/11/2019,This is such a charming & cozy place to stay. The photos dont do it justice. Its a peaceful haven from the busy city but still so easy & quick to get around on the LUAS. Michele is a thoughtful & easygoing host. It was perfect for my long business trip.
6142988,546870330,10/14/2019,"It's a beautiful house, with a little cute garden, quiet, and near a tram station to the center of the city. Michelle is a lovely person! Kind-hearted, extremely polite, with great hospitality and always a big smiling. I would love to come again and again:)"
6164856,423495287,3/14/2019,"This Airbnb is lovely and is in a terrific location, allowing easy access by foot to all of the popular tourist attractions in Dublin. We walked throughout the city and had a wonderful experience."
6164856,441774579,4/22/2019,Fabulous stay and beautiful accomodation. Thanks Bridget!
6164856,455174023,5/19/2019,Great location and full of homely comforts
6167941,468390401,6/12/2019,"Luke was very helpful in letting me make a last minute reservation and arranging for me to get into the apartment while he was out of town. As noted in the description, the room itself is quite small, but the bathroom (private, but not en-suite) is quite large, though unfinished. Overall, a very basic space, but complete with basic necessities."
6167941,476928734,6/27/2019,Luke is a smart and pleasant host. The communication and the stay were very nice.
6167941,484718566,7/9/2019,Luke is so hospitable and the location is really beneficial if you need to get to UCD. I would really recommend staying here.
6167941,520146123,8/30/2019,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6167941,535432457,9/24/2019,"Luke was a very good host. He was very hospitable, friendly and I enjoyed chatting with him and about his amazing experiences travelling and meeting people from around the world. He also had dinner prepared, unfortunately I already had my dinner so had to decline the offer. 
There was a leak in the room that morning that Luke had fixed. When confirming the booking he had warned me about it and said that he is not sure if due to the rains it may leak again. Even when I was at his place, he offered to cancel my booking if I felt it was worse than how he had described it over the phone. I liked his honesty. (fortunately there was no leak while I was there, even though it rained all night)"
6167941,553470433,10/24/2019,Place was fine. Bathroom was in the middle of repairs during my stay and wasn't very presentable. The room is quite small and there was an unpleasant odour in the bedroom/apartment.
6174064,419960362,3/5/2019,She was very accommodating and helpful. Our plane arrived before check in time but she allowed us to bring in our bags and park our rental car there early! She also gave us recommendations on places to visit and the directions to them too!
6174064,420280916,3/6/2019,"Penny's little granny flat is a sweet, compact and very stylish abode. Perfectly situated for a sassanach doing the Dublin night run. Her recommendations for local venues were spot-on and the added touch of providing some toys for our daughter was very thoughtful."
6174064,423500613,3/14/2019,"Perfect place for 3 people. Nice and clean. Close to bus lines, pubs, and market."
6174064,423884832,3/15/2019,"I've stayed at Penny's place twice now, so I'd guess that's a pretty good recommendation in and of itself. It's a clean, well-kept spot in a quiet neighborhood but it's just a quick bus ride away from the city center. There is also a beautiful- but long- walk to Poolbeg Lighthouse that I highly recommend. Great place to stay, especially if you need to get to the airport in a hurry- it's only one bus stop away."
6174064,424919523,3/17/2019,"It was absolutely amazing staying here. Pennys house is quaint, clean, beautiful and very comfortable. She was amazing! Wonderful human and place to stay. She helped with places to go, restaurants, printing out a boarding pass because we had an emergency, and so much more. We had an amazing time!"
6174064,425497336,3/18/2019,"Penny was very accommodating and welcoming, she allowed us to drop off the luggage and get the keys early which allowed us more time for sightseeing. We really enjoyed our St Patricks Day in Dublin. Thanks Penny"
6174064,428576764,3/25/2019,"We had a great stay at Penny's, she was prompt with replies and very helpful. Would recommend!"
6174064,432896147,4/5/2019,"The apartment was enlivened with the brilliant art of the hostess, who was warm, welcoming and a pleasure to get to know.  Ringsend is a fabulous location for getting into town or just taking in the port views!"
6174064,435103005,4/9/2019,"We enjoyed Penny's place - found the location to be good. Only a half mile to the bus and to the tram which we used very often in the four days we were there. Only like 15 min bus ride to the airport which was also helpful for us when it was time to go home. I booked it because of the garden area behind the house, but we didn't get to enjoy it because of the weather. Sleeping space was plenty for three people. We really only were there to sleep as Dublin has so much history we kept ourselves busy seeing everything! It was a great trip!"
6174064,435428880,4/10/2019,"Great location for Dublin airport comings and goings. Space was well appointed, comfortable and clean. Great value."
6174064,439089643,4/18/2019,Nice place. Penny is a great hoste and caring. Would love to come back some day
6174064,441765291,4/22/2019,Penny and her husband are very friendly and helpful. They had the room ready when we arrived early in the morning. It has everything you need. Great place to stay. Would come back anytime. Thank you for a great stay.
6174064,442443858,4/23/2019,"Penny was a great host, very easy to communicate with and very friendly. The place is clean and has all that you need on a visit to Dublin."
6174064,442788782,4/24/2019,"Pennys place is a delightful gem - just a short stretch of the legs from downtown, so much artful charm. Would definitely stay again!"
6174064,443199249,4/25/2019,"If you want to experience staying in an Irish home, I would recommend this. Penny has a cute little place next to her house (apartment) and she could be reached for any issues you have. The place is nearby enough to catch the bus to other parts of the city. My experience was good as it was my last day before returning home."
6174064,444734036,4/28/2019,"Great compact space just outside of downtown. John was great in communicating with us, and check in was easy. Buses are plentiful to downtown, just aa few blocks away fro the apartment. We left our bags w/ John for a few hours after check out which was a nice perk, as our departing flight was late in the day."
6174064,446430006,5/1/2019,"We came for 3 night with our cat and that was perfect ! Penny is really kind. 
It s an lovely apartment perfect for 2 or 3. The apartment is totaly new ! Thank you again for everything !!"
6174064,449223019,5/6/2019,"The place was even nicer than the pictures showed. It was a 30 minute + walk along the lovely Liffey River to downtown, which we enjoyed very much. Nice and quiet, very smooth communications, clean and very sweet little apartment. You will not at all regret booking with Penny!"
6174064,450843138,5/10/2019,"Friendly service, good location close to public transport"
6174064,452887147,5/14/2019,"Penny and her husband are warm and friendly people. We felt really welcome. Her place has a nice location close to Dublins Docklands and is easy walking to explore the rest of the city. Rent a car and explore the surroundings as well, like Glendalough and Newgrange, or coastal towns like Howth and Dalkey."
6174064,453989474,5/17/2019,Penny was super nice and my friends and I enjoyed our stay. She was also very accommodating in letting us drop off our bags earlier than check in which we appreciated.
6174064,458571157,5/26/2019,Great quiet location but still in the city! Instant coffee maker was a LIFE SAVER & the beds were super comfortable!
6174064,459357288,5/27/2019,"Nice, clean place to stay! Penny and John were very accomodating and friendly. About a 20-25 minute walk to downtown Dublin. A great affordable option for staying in Dublin!"
6174064,460525803,5/29/2019,Pennys place is well appointed. It does have a washing machine which is lovely. The garden is quite nice. It is about a 15 minute walk to get to the house from the 747 bus stop and unless you want a long walk a bus ride is needed to get to the city center. Penny is very responsive to communication and the check in process was extremely easy.
6174064,460855390,5/30/2019,Super nice and welcoming. Place was cute and exactly as the pictures showed. Thank you :)
6174064,461336830,5/31/2019,"We had a great stay and an ideal location within easy walking distance to The Point makes Pennys a great find, will definitely be back again."
6174064,462765245,6/2/2019,"The space was very clean and cute. It was about 20 minutes outside the touristy areas, but in a quite area near the docks. The pullout sofa was surprisingly comfortable for two people and the shower was great!"
6174064,463973063,6/4/2019,"This place was great! Just a walk over the bridge 10-15 minutes to the Luas where you can get all around Dublin. The place was very clean and had everything we needed and if not, Penny was very helpful. Their adorable dog was a plus!"
6174064,464688326,6/6/2019,"Very nice location, 30mn walk from trinity College. Clean and tidy stay for two to three persons. Host is reactive, and has nice attentions."
6174064,467508636,6/10/2019,"Penny is a great host and the flat is great, it is very comfortable. She gave us useful tips about the city. The tram and the airport bus stops are close just few minutes walk from the flat."
6174064,468348338,6/12/2019,"Penny is unmatched in how great she is as a host! This place is great, opens up to a little back garden/patio, has lots of sunlight, includes maps, is close to transportation, and has everything youd need. Penny is an amazing host! Every question we had, she answered. She was generous and gracious, offering us thread and needle when our diaper bag ripped. Our one year old loved exploring the house and back garden. She made great local recommendations on top of all that. Great end to our trip to Ireland!"
6174064,468842064,6/13/2019,Great experience .
6174064,469882856,6/15/2019,"Great cosy place, lots of great local tips, comfy bed, good location for 3 arena, RDS and aviva stadiums. We had a great stay!"
6174064,470401328,6/16/2019,"Great communication, easy check in and out."
6174064,471854724,6/18/2019,"Penny's Airbnb already looked good in the advert, and we were not at all disappointed when we arrived! It's a very cute little apartment, tastefully furnished and decorated, supplied with anything you could ask for, very clean. The best feature however, for me anyway, were the big windows/french doors out onto the garden. When you came back from the mad bustle of Dublin, this was like a haven of calmness where you could unwind. 
Check-in was easy, Penny was so willing to accomodate our wishes, quick to answer, so helpful with all information we needed. We were given many tips and help to get around, and there were cute, handwritten boards with recommendations for places to eat and stores to find all around. The location is great, right by the harbour, but because the house and especially the garden are set back from the main road, you wouldn't be able to tell. It's very quiet. Stores, restaurants and pubs are nearby, and you also find the bus stop there from where you can get to the city centre in 10 minutes. It really is a great base from where to explore Dublin! 
We will definitely be back if we ever travel to Dublin again and if Penny will have us! Thank you!"
6174064,475945673,6/25/2019,Die Lage der Wohnung ist toll. Gleich bei der S-Bahn und dem Flughafenbus. Und gerade bei Ebbe kann man am Strand laufen.
6174064,479637438,7/1/2019,"Pennys little apartment is a lovely place to stay if you visit Dublin. It is in a very quiet end of the city, but still just a short taxi ride into the city (or 20 min walk).  We found it very well appointed with many thoughtful touches. It was very clean and found the beds to be very comfortable. Penny and John were very gracious and safeguarded our bags upon our early arrival until checking time, allowing us to explore the city encumbered."
6174064,480308006,7/2/2019,"Penny's place was perfect for me for my last day in Dublin. It was located in a nice quiet neighborhood, but accessible to buses and shopping. It was close to the ferry port and easy access to the airport.
John and Penny provided lots of suggestions for local eating and drinking. The space was nicely decorated and had loads of nice extras like tea and coffee available.
Thanks for the great stay!"
6174064,488722961,7/15/2019,Pennys place was so peaceful and relaxing yet so close to all the local amenities. We walked into Dublin and back and that was such a lovely walk. Its a perfect spot for where we needed to be and I wouldnt hesitate to stay again.
6174064,490945716,7/19/2019,"The place is in the quiet area near the port. It takes 7 minutes to walk to the area central place with a couple of shops, pubs and a bus stop to the city centre. If you are determined to walk you should spare half an hour or a bit more to reach Trinity area. It leads along a very busy street though so it is not a pleasantly walk. 
It takes 10 minutes by bus nr 1.
The garden you have to share with the hosts and lovely singing birds early in the morning. The flat gives you all the privacy you need. The peace and quiet literally lulls you to sleep.
PS.
Watch out for dog poo everywhere along the pavements."
6174064,491495517,7/20/2019,"Penny is a super friendly person. We had a good tea and a long conversation. The rooms are fiedly, modern, open and very clean and very well decorated. We loved her Paintings.

We enjoed our stay and playing with her Dog. 
If we go again to Dublin we will come back."
6174064,492404728,7/21/2019,"Really good location, very clean and spacious apartment"
6174064,495008998,7/25/2019,"Within a couple of minutes of being in Pennys place we knew we would come back for our next stay in Dublin. Penny couldnt have been more accommodating, she was absolutely delightful and so helpful. Even throughout the house there were whiteboards full of info and tips (Like bar recommendations). We had everything we needed, including a food cupboard full of tea and coffee as well as jam and milk in the fridge. While it is a 40 minute walk to the centre of Dublin (near-about Temple Bar), it was a straightforward walk with lots to see and cafes along the way. It was a very straightforward check in and check out process, and the whole time we felt completely at ease. It is a home from home."
6174064,500495863,8/2/2019,"My friend and I stayed at Pennys for 4 nights and it was one of our favorite places we stayed! Penny was so kind and helpful, and gave us lots of tips on the best restaurants around the area. It was a beautiful house, and everything was very clean. We would absolutely recommend to a friend!"
6174064,501183283,8/3/2019,"Immaculately clean, lovely little flat with pretty garden. Highly recommended."
6174064,511504590,8/17/2019,"A quaint little place in a quiet neighborhood away from the bustle of the city center. We chose it mainly because of its relative proximity to the airport and ease of parking. Easily connected to the center by public transportation as well as taxi. Penny is a great host, very responsive and hospitable. The place was clean, comfortable, cosy, and matched the description. Definitely recommended!"
6174064,513890387,8/20/2019,"Very nice and cosy place. The pictures dont do right to it as its bigger than the pictures can show. Very good isolated, comfy bed, clean, quiet area."
6174064,521638036,9/1/2019,"Pennys place was an absolute gem. It was in a peaceful location just a short walk from downtown, and the community was so friendly! Dublin is an awesome international city, but Ringsend has maintained a small town, authentically Irish charm despite being located next to a major metropolitan center. It was so nice to come home every night to the quiet seaside smells and sounds! The back garden was charming, the house was tastefully decorated with care, and it was exceptionally clean. But best of all, Penny and her whole family were so warm and welcoming. I would HIGHLY recommend this space to anyone, especially those who love the hustle and bustle by day, and peaceful sleeps in an Irish village at night:)"
6174064,525990740,9/8/2019,"Phenomenal host! Super kind couple. Accommodating and able to fulfill all your requests! Great location, value. Clean! Would stay again!!  thanks for everything Penny and John!"

6179782,425490133,3/18/2019,Great home to borrow for your vacation plans. Short walk to a great village and the DART station which made getting to town easy. The owners were always very helpful and accommodating!

6200024,465178535,6/7/2019,"One word : waow !
What a place we have discovered, even more, what a person we have discovered.
We were just looking for a simple evening out of town, but Dorothy made it simply beautifull.
Her house is a wonderfull home just by Malahide which is very convenient for a nice walk/diner in town.
Also her house is a very warm place, very clean, quiet, and very comfortable. Our room was more than we expected, every detail needed was there for us, and had a great night sleep.
In the morning, a very nice breakfast was waiting for us and we loved it. We even got to chat with Dorothy while having coffee and shared intersting stories with her.
We recommend this place 100% and look foward to see Dorothy again."
6200024,469869698,6/15/2019,"Great place to stay, great communication, easy check-in, and lovely light breakfast."
6200024,476009109,6/25/2019,"What a memorable time!

My husband and I stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon to recuperate after the long flight. The neighborhood is so peaceful and quiet and the bed was so comfortable we were able to get some much needed rest. Another plus is that there is a beautiful park with a castle within walking distance as well as plenty of restaurants. Our absolute favorite part though was Dorothy's superb hospitality! She cooked us a lovely breakfast that we'll never forget and she helped us figure out the train schedule to get to our next destination. Oh and their dog is absolutely delightful and so adorable he was the cherry on top of this wonderful experience!

6217485,427778393,3/24/2019,Great place
6217485,431036134,3/31/2019,Great location. No hot water for showers despite being told the hot water was turned on. Housekeeper very pushy and invasive when checking out etc eg knocking on door for us to leave.
6217485,432949689,4/5/2019,"Must choose Davids when coming to Dublin!
Location: Very central. Close to DART/Busaras (main train/bus stations) if one chooses to travel outside Dublin City.
Accommodation: Too good.  Clean. Spacious. A nice two bed apartment with a balcony. 
Value for money: Definitely a positive. Except, one would have to pay ‚Ç¨5 every day for electricity so dont forget to add that to the total."
6217485,436592100,4/13/2019,Great location.
6217485,439080487,4/18/2019,"Our stay was perfect, a lot of little things really pleased us. First of them was the ideal location close from everything you could ask (only walk for 4 days) while being realy quiet and peaceful. 
You can also enjoy a huge number of TV Chanel from every country.
Great surprise was also the very comfortable beds after a long day or night.
To sum up : highly recommanded !"
6217485,444641730,4/28/2019,Nice apartment near temple bar an public transport.
6217485,447887063,5/4/2019,"We were a family of 5 adults beginning our trip in Ireland. We found the beds very comfortable and slept well. The location was perfect for our activities. We went to Trinity College, Vintage tea tour. David was easy to communicate with. We will stay again!"
6217485,451695022,5/12/2019,Good base for a weekend in Dublin. A short walk away from temple bar (10/15mins). Or a 6‚Ç¨ taxi. safe and secure. Good communication on check in. In a nice part of town. Would definitely book again.

6217485,461941233,6/1/2019,Great base from which to explore Dublin. All the main city centre attractions are within walking distance. We had a great 3 night stay.
6217485,464241561,6/5/2019,Davids place was great! Him and his caretaker were quick to respond whenever I had a question. The apartment was clean and walking distance away from most attractions.

6217485,517429937,8/25/2019,Muy bien.
6217485,524105102,9/5/2019,"Awesome location, sun-drenched space, a balcony, a bath tub, a washing machine, and a TV system with heaps of movies.  Great for busy travellers looking for a place to relax with all the most valuable amenities."
6217485,530888007,9/16/2019,"Great location!  Easy walking and transit nearby.  Unit could use a little TLC, as looking worn in some places.  Think electric bill should be included in rental fee -  paid 5 euro per day for 9 days and were hardly there, which we thought was a bit steep.  Unit says it has two bedrooms and an air bed, and we assumed the air bed would be available to use if required.   When we asked where the airbed was, expecting it would be available in a closet, the caretaker said we did not mention it in the reservation, and it was not on site. No offer from caretaker to get it for us.  So, when we had two family members stay over unexpectedly on a couple of nights, we had to sleep on the living room floor.  Air bed should be available in a closet in case it is needed.   Overall, pleased with the rental, and would recommend it if you want to walk around Dublin."
6217485,533248021,9/21/2019,Great host great place
6217485,535339028,9/24/2019,"I booked this apartment for mother for a one night stay, the Communication with David was very quick and professional. feedback from my mother was that she loved the place and would stay again, keep it up David and thanks to Carla as well."
6217485,542232330,10/6/2019,"Very nice place! About a 20 minute walk to temple bar area. We were late getting into the city and they were very flexible and able to meet us an hour and a half later than expected! We had five girls, two full sized beds in separate rooms and a queen blowup mattress in the living room. Worked out perfectly for us!"
6217485,544564676,10/10/2019,"Nice location and clean space. Carla met us at the unit, and was very thorough in her welcome"
6217485,545395225,10/12/2019,"Great place, secluded enough but still walking distance to major spots. Would stay again."
6217485,550173495,10/18/2019,"The apartment is really well located and the basic services are functioning well. We had problems with the cleanliness of the apartment. I also recommend that both parties respect the check-in and check-out times, especially after traveling more than 17 hours, we just wanted to get to the place to rest."
6217485,552337658,10/21/2019,"A warm welcome, clean apartment and close to amenities you. You can't go wromng booking with David"
6217485,555180417,10/27/2019,"Davids place is very spacious, and makes you feel at home (plenty of coffee, shower gel etc). Defects with the flat were acknowledged by the caretaker instead of ignored and left."
6217485,558090867,11/2/2019,"This place had lots of space for our group of four. Away from some of the more touristy bits of Dublin but close to tram stops, restaurants, and lots of pubs! Would stay again"
6219587,423179263,3/13/2019,"This place is a nightmare. 
Carla was very suspicious of me because I was traveling alone and kept asking me to confirm how many were staying. One thing the listing doesnt mention is that you need to pay for your electricity (¬£5 a day per person) you must pay in Cash/ on your phone as you are checking in. 
While you pay for electricity, not all of the lights work, the power stopped working on the outlets because I plugged in the electric fireplace. After waiting 30 minutes I got a text back from Carla saying that I was not allowed to use that and I was in the wrong for trying to but this apartment is COLD. Im warning you right now, the pictures make it look better than it is. It is run down, uncomfortable, and over all for the $275 I paid for 3 days, not worth it in the least. I would have rather spent $25 more and stayed in a hostel. Its dirty, I had to sleep on the couch the first night because the sheets had hair in them and I had to hang them up to dry. 
The washer (works horribly and smells like mold) in the kitchen had old cloths in it from a previous guest (Im assuming) and the cooktop was very slow. 
Im warning you now, dont let the location get you because in this case, it is not location location locationù it is bad bad badù
Save yourself, you need to be highly intoxicated to get though a stay here. 
As the days went on, I noticed more and more things that were dirty and broken. I took pictures when I arrived because I dont trust that Carla will tell the truth when it comes to something being broken, based on how she was acting when I first arrived. 
This was a super upsetting stay. I recommend finding elsewhere."
6219587,429585480,3/28/2019,"This house is very misrepresented. As I was looking for the hairdryer and iron I found drawers of junk, closets with luggage, plastic tubs full of stuff (clothes maybe?) The shelves are full of books, mail, knick knacks, an almost empty bottle of alcohol. I'm pretty sure someone lives here on a normal basis (which is fine, but I would like to be informed of that). Never found the iron, by the way, which I needed.  Had to pay ‚Ç¨5 a day for power, I was aware of that. But Carla made me worried I would run out of power. When I checked out the website to top up (just in case) I couldnt use it because I do not have an Irish phone number. So I lived in the dark for the first day worried I would run out of electricity.  I ended up figuring out how to check my electricity usage and by the 4th day as I was leaving I had 3 days worth of power left. (The website states that for a whole family ‚Ç¨25-28 a week would be average) So ‚Ç¨5 a day for a solo person that is touring the country is overkill.  So I paid for electricity for the rest of the week for whoever lives there. And if no one does live here,  the apartment needs to be cleared out of all unnecessary objects and half eaten food. 

Couch had a hole, chair seat was ripped, tile floor had huge chunk missing, coffee table was marred up, dishes all chipped, silverware bent beyond repair. Cords duct taped to walls. Dead flowers left on the coffee table. Half used bottle of tomato sauce and some ham in the fridge. Open corn flakes on the counter. Bathroom was decent, shower walls were funky though, stained grout had been painted over. No bathroom garbage can. Towels were like sandpaper. Bed was springy and uncomfortable.  Light fixtures hung down in front of doors and I was constantly worried about ripping the paper shades. Front door lock was a pain. Tv was basically useless,  only youtube, and you couldn't even use the search feature,  so I was stuck watching the popular videos that popped up.  Creepy phone on the wall that when picked up you could hear someones tv and living noises. I actually wanted to leave, but didnt want to pay for another room without a guarantee of getting my money back, so I just sucked it up and stayed. 

Location was pretty inaccurate. 5 mins to guiness, yes. But not 15 mins to trinity college, my Gps said 28 mins. Bad neighborhood.  Route home was dark and scary to walk at night."
6219587,432940151,4/5/2019,"Nice place and the area is quite convenient if you want to visit Dublin, but still have quiet nights."
6219587,434629762,4/8/2019,Poco recomendable
6219587,437830911,4/15/2019,"Very nice quiet place only a short walk to pretty much everything. Lots of local options only a block away. If you are a sports fan following games, this place has every channel on the planet so you never miss a game/show/PPV.... Great service and no complaints."
6219587,439659274,4/19/2019,Everything was fine. Thank you
6219587,448590220,5/5/2019,"Lovely apartment and extremely good location, walking distance to most places we wanted to visit in Dublin."
6219587,450734435,5/10/2019,This appartment was very close to food outlets cake vegie and meat shops. Transport around Dublin was within easy walking distance. In all very handy for a tourist.
6219587,468733000,6/13/2019,"Excellent place, excellent location, and excellent host!

The property is located within a few minutes walk of all kinds of Dublin attractions, which made getting around very easy.

The property itself was a great home-away-from-home with all the amenities you could need. Someone was there to meet us at check in and show us around, which was very helpful, and checkout was fast and simple, which was convenient because we had a VERY early flight out.

The rules of the property were concise, and completely reasonable. Our hosts really knew how to make our stay as comfortable and accommodating as possible. It really made our trip to Dublin great."

6219587,473153149,6/21/2019,"We stayed only one night, and we didnt have any issues. Great location and an easy stay. Would definitely book again."
6219587,477544667,6/28/2019,Great value for such a central location!
6219587,480288144,7/2/2019,"David was great communicating through my trip, we checked in with Carla and paid for the power- never had any issues. This was a quiet area tucked away but walkable to many attractions. Our favorite was Arthur's Pub on Thomas Street! Check-out was very easy."
6219587,481607697,7/5/2019,"Amazing location. Right around the corner from a yummy bakery and cafe. Close to all the famous sites like Dublinia and St Patrick's Cathedral. The house itself was great. Lots of space with full kitchen, hot water and a comfy bed. Will. E staying here again."
6219587,490920347,7/19/2019,The apartment is located right in the heart of the city! No need for bus transport. Check in was super fast and easy! It looks just like on the pictures - very nice for a few days in Dublin.

6219587,497316642,7/28/2019,A lovely place in a great location. Very clean and comfortable. The girl checking me in was lovely and was very flexible with check-in time and paying for electricity top-up. Overall would really recommend staying here.

6219587,519761580,8/29/2019,Over all great stay   the location is the best.  Host was super nice.
6219587,523273491,9/3/2019,Good location and communication. Have stayed with this host twice by chance and enjoyed both times.
6219587,526788783,9/9/2019,Lovely apartment that was very close to everything. Pictures are very accurate and they were able to accommodate and early check in for me. Would stay here again and recommend to friends.
6219587,531852966,9/18/2019,"The apartment was nice and tidy, also very close to the city center.
We met Carla at check in and she was very kind and helpful.
Would recommend as a good place to explore Dublin from.
Lots of TV channels also helped us relax after a long day of walking around."
6219587,533325226,9/21/2019,The location was super central which was fantastic and exactly what we were looking for. I only gave four stars because its not in the best neighbourhood and I wouldnt recommend it as a great place for families or people with young children because it is neighbouring to the local drug dealer and constantly has people outside trying to buy. Great for back packers and individuals constantly on the go such as ourselves.
6219587,533946831,9/22/2019,"Close to attractions, only short walk into town."
6219587,535751049,9/25/2019,"Nice apartment, well located, I recommended"

6219587,545394534,10/12/2019,"Very nice place to stay, equipped with everything necessary. Was on a working trip and everything with check in went super smoothly. Close to the city centre, sights and the train station."

6226192,445368516,4/29/2019,Great place . was very clean . Ismenia is very friendly and we communicate very well. the place is close to main attractions in the city center .
6226192,446444417,5/1/2019,A lovely and cozy room. Very quiet and peaceful. Would stay again! Ismenia is a great host and very accommodating.
6226192,448628475,5/5/2019,I would recommend this place!
6226192,453244868,5/15/2019,"Ismenia is very nice and will respond quickly. She walked me through everything and asked if I had any questions about the city. The room is decent and although you do not have access to the kitchen she provides: water, hot water kettle, tea and coffee along with a fridge to put your stuff in. In the bathroom she has pretty much everything you would need in terms of toiletries. Also location is key! Shes walking distance to almost any major site in Dublin! Would definitely stay again. Thank You!"
6226192,454038847,5/17/2019,"Great location - not far from the city centre. Next to the Teeling Distillery.

Ismenia is very nice and can provide you with some tips about the area. She was able to accommodate a very last minute booking (5pm) and I'm appreciative of her flexibility.

Her place is a little old - wallpaper and some ceiling drywall peeling, but otherwise her place is very clean and I had a comfortable stay there."
6226192,457141569,5/23/2019,Very hospitable little place for 1-2 people.   City center is very walkable from here.   Ismenia Provides plenty of brochures and things to do during your stay along with other nice little touches.   Would stay here again (in fact I did on my return trip).
6226192,458652385,5/26/2019,"A great find, close to the centre but not too expensive. Ismenia is quick to communicate and was very helpful."
6226192,460040857,5/28/2019,Good quiet place for travelers on a budget.
6226192,464783831,6/6/2019,My second stay at this place and highly recommend for a quick stay in Dublin. Walking distance to everything

6226192,469855743,6/15/2019,"Close to many great locations in the Temple Bar area. I walked everywhere.

Fantastic host: very personable and helpful.

Only inconvenience was the bathroom is shared among 3 bedrooms so you may have to wait on occasion.

Rooms were nice, clean, and warm.

Mini-fridges in room, which was useful. Coffee, tea and water provided.

Great breakfast places nearby."

6226192,478941253,6/30/2019,"Clean and very near the city attractions. Bathroom is wide and comfortable. A very quiet place. Good fridge, no TV (and specified in the services)
I advice you before choosing this room, to read carefully the services not provided. In my case I needed the closet to hang my whole shirts for a week stay to go to a congress, and it was not possible, it was  fully occupied with another persons clothes. Then, although there are some services not provided and specified in Airbnb website, this one was not specified, even though a closet is the minimum you expect to find in a room you rent."
6226192,494899442,7/25/2019,"Awesome place, very close to the city center. Very calm as well."
6226192,504894391,8/8/2019,Centrally located & the hosts are very nice and responsive. If all you need is a clean bedroom and a shower - this place is perfect!

6226192,513940926,8/20/2019,"The hosts were great and responsive, the place was clean and within walking distance from St. Patrick's cathedral. Real, functioning shower was great plus (instead of some bathtub version)."

6226192,548182462,10/17/2019,"The host is nice, I changed my check-in time till very late, her son received me in good order.  The host called me cause she really cares if I already find and enter into the building in good order.   I can feel Ismenia is a responsible host.  The guest has to realize the bedroom without locker,  it cannot be locked, it's ok for me! The host also reminded in advance.  I still suggest the host to install a locker for bed room because it can give more better feeling to most of other guests."
6226406,421931500,3/10/2019,"Super friendly and felxible check in, great communication and uncomplicated stay. Great location and value  if all you need is a bed to sleep in and an bathroom."

6226406,441730756,4/22/2019,I had a great stay with Ismenia. The home is in a great spot near the city center. Also very close to the Guinness tour. Check in was easy and the bed super comfy. Perfect for relaxing after a long day of exploring!
6226406,443656358,4/26/2019,Great location for sightseers and workers!
6226406,444819631,4/28/2019,This place is in a perfect location for staying in central Dublin. It's only 10 minutes walk to the Radisson Blu and Temple Bar was very near.
6226406,447257164,5/3/2019,Good location and very nice host!
6226406,457472768,5/24/2019,It was great to be Ismenia's guest. She is very helpful and friendly! The location of the apartment is great. Thank you!
6226406,459414971,5/27/2019,"The place is well located to enjoy the city at best. The bed is confortable ,the shower also.  There are no keys for the private room but Ismenia and her son are very respectful of your belongings, you will find a refilled bottle of fresch water every day without moving anything else. There is an other room with possible guests, anyway the access to the bathroom wasn't difficult at all. Ismenia is kind and helpful.
Thank you for everything."
6226406,460526879,5/29/2019,"Ismenias place was perfect for my brief stay in Dublin! Located literally around the corner from two of the best distilleries in Dublin, The Liberties Distillery and Teeling (Jameson is overrated and they dont even distill on site anymore). The apartment was clean and exactly as advertised. Ismenia had great travel and dining recommendations for me (go to Camden Market for meals!! Temple Bar is dirty, overrated, and overpriced, with the exception of Klaw which I highly recommend for fresh seafood and wonderful staff). Ismenia was so kind and hospitable, she felt like a sister. All the major sites I wanted to visit (from Guinness to Trinity College) were no more than a 15-20 min walk from her place. I was amazed at how easy it is to get around Dublin, and after one walk I knew exactly where I was and Ismenias place was very easy to find thereafter (if you can see St. Patricks Cathedral, youll know exactly how to get back home). Great stay and I can not recommend enough for a solo traveler or even a couple!"
6226406,463496274,6/3/2019,"The room and bathroom were super clean. I met Ismenia and her son briefly and they were both very kind and lovely. This place is about a 15-minute walk from Temple bar, so very close to the centre. If you're only looking for a place to sleep, this is a good option for you."
6226406,465162080,6/7/2019,"Lovely sized, tastefully decorated double room. Location is good for all Dublin attractions. Host is super helpful."
6226406,466594048,6/9/2019,A really great place to stay. The room is a bit bigger than what you would assume out of the picture. Its in a super great spot of Dublin.
6226406,476912250,6/27/2019,"Ismenia is very kind, I suggest this place!"
6226406,480180494,7/2/2019,"Very comfortable bed. Excellent location. Good, safe neighbourhood with no noise from traffic or neighbours."
6226406,489150680,7/16/2019,"The appartment was very close to the center of Dublin. We were able to do many things, such as shopping/ temple bar area by walking! That was amazing."
6226406,491408811,7/20/2019,The location was great and they communicated well with us. I would recommend staying here if you are in need of a place in Dublin.

6226406,506984148,8/11/2019,"Great location, 20 minutes walking distance to everything. Ismenia and Joysse both reply really fast. Would have been nice to know I was staying with other travellers too as I was a bit confused at first but overall felt safe and slept well!"
6226406,509272036,8/14/2019,"The room is exactly as advertised. Good bed, a towel, and a bottle of water. Other than that, you really get nothing else. It was perfectly lovely for me as I left at 6 every morning and didnt return till midnight. Communication is very good and everything touristy is about a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute easy walk away. Wish the towel was a bit nicer and that there was someplace to put clothes (even a tiny shelf) but it turned out great and I would return here. Thanks for a lovely stay!

Note that the place can be hard to find in (Hidden by Airbnb) /apple maps. Its much easier to navigate to the Teeling Distillery which is next door."
6226406,517376500,8/25/2019,A central location in a clean house. Basic facilities but ideal for simply crashing out after a long day.
6226406,521796758,9/1/2019,"Communication was prompt with Ismenia. The apartment is a leisurely 20min walk to  the center. St Patricks Cathedral is a 6min. The apartment is clean and the bed is super comfortable. Joysse is very respectful of your privacy. Despite the language barrier, you just immediately feel welcome into their space. Highly recommend."

6226406,528643172,9/13/2019,"Ismenia is a very hospitable and considerate host; you could tell she really cared that you were comfortable and had everything you needed! The room is cozy and clean... you don't have access to the kitchen, so don't plan on making meals or bringing home leftovers, but the space is a good value for what it is!"

6226406,541572373,10/5/2019,"Ismenia is so kind! As an anxious traveller, staying at her place was like a warm hug. She helped me feel grounded when I arrived and helped me with everything from figuring out my transformer to calling me a taxi. Really excellent host! The location is nice, quiet, and within 15 minutes walking distance from everywhere youd want to go. Right around the corner is the Fumbally Cafe & Tenters, both places I would also recommend. Thanks again for the great stay, Ismenia!"
6226406,548308990,10/17/2019,"The room was clean and the apartment is in a strategic location , just 10 min walk to the city centre. It was what I needed! I will definitely book again if I am back to Dublin."

6237072,503741798,8/6/2019,Great child friendly house in a quiet neighbourhood
6247667,449680605,5/7/2019,Anne provided a welcome hamper which was lovely and so helpful after travelling so we didn't need to worry about essentials. A quiet location at the end of a cul de sac.

6266903,432262942,4/3/2019,We really enjoyed our stay here! It was as described and really cool to stay in an old distillery. The old brick walls were awesome. I really appreciated Johns communication and we were able to extend our stay an extra day at the last minute as well.
6266903,434014035,4/7/2019,Great space.  Nice location.

6266903,458614810,5/26/2019,Great stay!  Highly recommend... especially to anyone who is attending an event at Croke Park.
6266903,460094159,5/28/2019,A lovely loft apartment just on the outskirts of Dublin. Great for a weekend away with good public transport links. A little out of the way if you're wanting to go out in the evenings to the middle of the city.
6266903,460927017,5/30/2019,"John's place is a stylist apartment in a lovely building with a big comfy bed.
The apartment is a good 30 mins away from the centre so be prepared for a bit of a walk but John's recommendation for transport as well as bars, restaurants and traditional Irish pubs was brilliant and so helpful."

6266903,476486574,6/26/2019,We had a lovely stay at this apt. We prefer to stay in a quiet area outside of the city and this was perfect for us. We took taxis & the #13 bus into & back from the city easily. The apt is very clean and comfortable and the building is very quiet. The lift is ideal if you have a lot of luggage (like us). John was attentive and quick to respond to all of our questions. I would definitely stay here again!
6266903,479694896,7/1/2019,"John is a great host! Check in was flawless! His apt is amazing with amazing views, charming character. The building is equally charming with such cool character! While there, he was quick in his responses. He's kind, gracious and very accommodating. There were added touches that made us feel like we were home. The walking distance to/from downtown Dublin was a bit longer than described. We ended up using the taxi service more than planned so it got to be more expensive than planned. If we stay in Dublin in the future, we'll be sure to look to see if his apt is available! Thank you, John! :-)"
6266903,482419791,7/6/2019,Great apartment to stay in Dublin

6266903,524622310,9/6/2019,"Lovely loft in North Dublin. Centre of town easily accessible by buses and the spaciousness and style of the apartment makes up for the slight distance.

6266903,528060466,9/12/2019,This place was amazing!  We loved the thoughtful touches like fresh flowers and the building was really cool being an old distillery!

6267817,559616499,11/4/2019,"Weldons place is the perfect place to stay in Dublin. His hospitality is unmatched, it is also one of the cleanest places Ive ever stayed and I am a frequent air bnb user when abroad. At Lucyswell youll be treated with such kindness. Bus stop is right outside that takes you right into city centre.. do not hesitate to stay here!"
6283612,449341305,5/6/2019,"The place is very nice, clean and you get a lot of space. 
It is outside town and is very quiet - the train station was out of order during our stay so we spend allot of time in the busses. If the train station is running normally I'm sure you will feel like you are quite close to town. If not and you have to use busses it will take about 1 hour to get to the center of Dublin which we were a bit sad about since we were only there for 2 days.
I will recommend the place if you're aware that you are not living in the central of Dublin."
6283612,451849987,5/12/2019,"Jennifer's apartment is lovely, like shown on the pictures. It is very well kept, has lots of natural light and the area is very quiet. It is perfect for two people. All the services are included. It is close to the airport, Howth and Dublin city. Communication with Jennifer was great. Arrival and departure were so easy. There is a welcome paper in the living room with the house rules and recommendations on what to do around the area. 
We very much enjoyed it and we highly recommend it."

6283612,525712852,9/8/2019,"Jennifer has been a very good host, very reactive to the messages. Her apartment's location is perfect if you want to discover the Irish coast (Howth, Malahide, etc.)."
6283612,538116966,9/29/2019,"The apartment is very lovely and clean and Jennifer is a great host! The trainstation is just 6 min walking so the center of Dublin is not far away.

All of that and its on a quiet block."
6286228,469749084,6/15/2019,"Fabulous, historical, quaint home. A pleasure to stay there! Great location surrounded by good restaurants!"

6286228,555117211,10/27/2019,"Dec place was a real gem. It is a beautifully preserved Georgian house with sensitive, stylish touches and all mod cons. There are beautiful spacious living spaces and bedrooms. I would highly recommend the place for anyone visiting Dublin. 
The location was in a beautiful, safe, and central part of Dublin. 
The host was very accommodating - providing parking permits and accomodating our less-than convenient arrival and departure times. 
We're very grateful!"
6290081,422024058,3/10/2019,"Great location, great flat with thoughtful touches making our short stay very comfortable.  Had some issues with the hot water, not sustaining all five of us, but otherwise it was an amazing stay!"

Everything you need was there we didn't need to take anything.. Thank you. xx"
6290081,444808349,4/28/2019,"Carmels place is absolutely beautiful! Upscale with top of the line appliances. The bathrooms are gorgeous with heated floors, HOT water with great pressure (much appreciated after traveling around Ireland). The espresso machine was also a plus! We stayed in other Airbnbs which were nice but lacked a coffee machine. Carmel is a wonderful host who genuinely wants your experience in Dublin to be memorable. Carmel has put together a thoroughly detailed welcome packet with maps, restaurant/pub/shopping/tourist recommendations which was very helpful! We have family in Ireland so go back often. We hope Carmels lovely place is available to us in the future! its located in a great location. Thanks again Carmel for everything (especially for stocking the fridge with water, wine, bread/butter, juice, coffee etc and for the lovely box of Butlers chocolates! Hope to see you again soon!
Ann Paul and family"

6290081,466517269,6/9/2019,"Highly recommend this property. Great space with high-end amenities.

Most of all, Carmel went above and beyond to help with some local advice."
6290081,468844126,6/13/2019,"We really loved Carmel and Johns place. It was very comfortable with plenty of room for our family.

6290081,493899163,7/23/2019,"Communicating with Carmel & John was perfect from the beginning. Their home is very modern, clean and loaded with numerous amenities and lots of extras.

If you need a place in Dublin - this is the place to reserve!They are definitely SUPERHOSTS :)"
6290081,497356691,7/28/2019,"The apartment was perfect for our first trip to Dublin.  It is a short walk from supermarkets and pharmacy, and 15m walk from restaurants and bars in the Temple Bar area. The hosts provided everything we needed and were available at all times to answer our questions very quickly. Its definitely been one of our favourite holidays so far, and would definitely recommend it to others!"
6290081,514966061,8/22/2019,What an amazing place!  Great place for my group of guys in Dublin.  Easy access to neighborhood pubs and restaurants.  Amenities were very nice as well.  Definitely would recommend for any future trips to Dublin!
6290081,529184234,9/14/2019,"Carmel & John are superior hosts! Their home, phenomenal, touches- amazing. We couldnt have asked for a better experience. 
They have thought of everything a traveler will need. They make you feel extremely at home like their home is yours. Comfortable, cozy, everything you need is there. If we ever traveling to Dublin again, we would definitely like to stay at this beautiful home once again. Thank you so much Carmel & John!"
6290081,534013113,9/22/2019,Great spot with plenty of room for the family to gather or retreat to their rooms.  Location was exactly what we were looking for and Carmel did an excellent job proving to notch local recommendations.  The onsite parking was also very convenient.
6290081,556682531,10/30/2019,See previous review.  We liked the place so much we began and ended our Ireland stay there.  Highly recommend.
6290081,559510552,11/4/2019,"Carmel and John are exceptional hosts.  They went out of their way to ensure our comfort.  The apartment is spacious, stylish and well-appointed with several outdoor terraces and wonderful views.  They provided a guidebook of suggestions for sights, pubs, and restaurants that was very helpful.  The Trocadero was so good we went twice and enjoyed fabulous meals.  The location of the penthouse is highly walkable to many sights, shopping and, of course, pubs.  We are looking forward to a return visit."
6294418,430358732,3/30/2019,"This place is in a quiet residential area of Dublin, near a tram station that takes you directly into downtown in about 10 minutes. The space is very clean and includes thoughtful touches including orange juice, bread butter and some other basics for breakfast that we definitely appreciated. The cottage is just as it is pictured, except that it is actually bigger than you might guess from looking at the place from the street or from pictures. There is some traffic noise from the neighboring streets, so light sleepers may want some earplugs but it is no big deal. This was a perfect spot for our family of four with kids 12 and 7, who enjoyed playing soccer and using the playground equipment while meeting new friends each day at the park and playground just down the street. They loved the board games and legos in the place too. We definitely would recommend this cottage to anyone looking for something that puts Dublin nightlife and excitement nearby while still offering families and anyone looking for a little quieter area a great option. Barbara was very easy to work with and check in is super easy."
6294418,432604429,4/4/2019,"The cottage was very spacious and it had everything we needed, including toys for our children which was brilliant.  Barbara was really great and easy to communicate with.  She left us some breakfast bits which was very much appreciated.  We all had a great time and the location was brilliant, only about 10 min walk into the city centre.  Would thoroughly recommend this beautiful cottage in the middle of Dublin."
6294418,450809034,5/10/2019,"My girlfriends and I stayed at Barbaras for a week and her place was perfect! There were 4 of us and we all had plenty of room. Her place was very clean and had everything we needed. Location was close to things also so we ended up walking everywhere even though the bus stop was just a couple blocks away. If I get a chance to visit Dublin again, Ill definitely rent from her again!"
6294418,454434487,5/18/2019,"Fantastic cottage close to the city centre. All expected amenities, and more, are there. Book it with no hesitation."
6294418,457135876,5/23/2019,"Great, quiet location just a short walk out of the main touristic area. It was also very convenient to Finn McCool's day tour bus pickup at Parnell Square. Spacious and clean with many amenities, would definitely stay again."
6294418,458757832,5/26/2019,"An amazing 3 night stay! Everything was fantastic, the cottage is beautiful, the location was amazing we walked to everything we needed!

It's a great Cottage, clean, lovely furniture and all bedrooms have en-suite. Very close to the city centre with local shops close by. Barbara was very welcoming and on hand for any queries. Don't look else where.  This is the place for you!!"
6294418,471277312,6/17/2019,"This cottageù met all of our needs and expectations.  It is well laid out, has a great, bright living room to gather in, comfortably sized bedrooms, and a nicely equipped kitchen.  Barbara is a gracious and responsive hostess.  The plus for us was we were in Dublin for Bloom's Day and we were a 7 minute walk to the Joyce Center!"
6294418,480639442,7/3/2019,"Barbara could not be a better host! Arranged a birthday cake  which was amazing. The little touches of cereals, bread, butter & eggs. As well as milk, juice tea & coffee meant we were in luxury! Very clean and beautifully decorated with everything you need... and only 10/15 min walk to city centre. 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è is not enough."
6294418,482279541,7/6/2019,Barbara goes above and beyond to make your stay special. We had all we needed for breakfast left for us for our three day stay. Great to have the use of a washing machine and dryer. The property is about a fifteen minute walk to the Temple Bar area and very close to shops for a few groceries. The house was very clean and comfortable. We would stay again.

6294418,532795619,9/20/2019,This was terrific. My family totally enjoyed Dublin. The location was a little off the beaten path it made it feel more homey and still very easy to get to everything we wanted!  Great  experience!!
6294418,535826678,9/25/2019,"Lovely cottage in a great location.  Walking distance to bus stop, shopping and many restaurants.  Extra special touches like coffee, Tea, milk, eggs, bread, jam, cereal, granola and more... was a pleasant surprise to make our first morning breakfast relaxing before heading out to explore the local sites.  We especially appreciated having 3 separate bedrooms and 3 separate bathrooms.  The washer and dryer were also very convenient.
Overall we were very pleased with our stay.  Would stay again and highly recommend!!"

Quiet, allowing us to spend quality family time without being intrusive. 
Definitely returning to Dublin and definitely returning to Barbaras."
6294418,555950663,10/28/2019,Die Wohnung ist komplett eingerichtet (sogar mit Trockner und Waschmaschine). Drei Badezimmer erleichtern den Aufenthalt mit mehreren Personen. In das Zentrum sind es ein paar Gehminuten aber es gibt immer etwas zu gucken.

6294418,564175759,11/15/2019,"We had a wonderful experience! The location is great, quiet but close to lots of great spots. Very clean, and the breakfast items provided were wonderful for weary travellers who got in to Dublin very late."
6294418,566014924,11/18/2019,"Adorable cottage just north of the river. 15minute walk to Temple Bar area makes it great to be in the hustle and bustle while going home to a quiet cottage. Really felt the cottage vibe as we loved the living room with thoughtful touches like board games and cozy blankets! Barbara was a great host- quick replies and super easy check in & out. As three young female travelers we felt extremely safe and at home in this adorable cottage. Would definitely recommend. Milk, bagels and other groceries provided  was also extremely kind and made our early departure time much easier! Fabulous experience!"
6294418,567396836,11/22/2019,Barbara was very responsive to any queries I had and her home was lovely.
6309046,485669551,7/11/2019,"Marcus's place was beautiful and comfortable. It is also located close to several places to get food or drinks, as well as close to stores. Would definitely recommend to anyone."

The house was perfect for us!"

6309046,513949587,8/20/2019,"Super stylish, wonderfully furnished, perfectly presented. It's a 20 minute walk to the Liffey and the conference facilities we were visiting on the other side. Location was perfect. And the rooms are MUCH bigger than they look on the site."
6309046,516259942,8/24/2019,Great house to relax in after a day in Dublin. Handy for Dart and airport bus. Easy to walk in to the city centre. Comfy beds!
6309046,552725370,10/22/2019,"This is an excellent location in Dublin just south of the CBD. Marcus was very responsive and flexible with everything about our trip. We certainly felt like it was a home away from home. Excellent for families, larger groups."
6309046,555102107,10/27/2019,Spacious house with great facilities. All buss stops are within a 10 minute walking distance. The Spar is at 5 minutes and open 24 hours. We had a great time!
6331197,504917168,8/8/2019,"This house is perfect for a family visiting Dublin.  The house is cozy and clean.  It is located in walking distance to Kilmainham Goal where, after visiting the jail,  you can get on the hop on hop off bus to see the rest of Dublin.  There is a French cafe just around the corner that has delicious breakfast and coffee.  If you need anything from the store there is a corner store in walking distance.

Erica was amazing!!!! It was very easy to communicate with her and if you have a question she is very fast to respond.  She left us a booklet of instructions and tips on what we can do in Dublin and suggestions on where to eat.

I highly recommend Erica and this house if you are planning on visiting Dublin.

The Angellotti Family"
6347315,425519460,3/18/2019,Everything was perfect !!
6347315,452678973,5/13/2019,The host canceled this reservation 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6347315,459268408,5/27/2019,"Fiona always reply to our messages and give us a call right before the date of arrival just to ensure that everything was Ok. The house is spacious, luminous and with good amenities, like a dishwasher. A friendly, quite and safe neighbourhood with good public transport to the city center (20 minutes) and close to supermarkets. A perfect stay in Dublin for our group of five. We  definitly recommend."
6347315,462445541,6/2/2019,Beautiful house with a ton of skylights. Very cozy.
6347315,466397831,6/9/2019,Fionas place was beautifully furnished and offered ample sunlight through multiple skylights.

6347315,517382147,8/25/2019,"Perfect location with a short walk to the tram station to get into Dublin (took about 20 min) Comfortable mattresses, lots of natural light and well-stocked kitchen."
6348110,481144017,7/4/2019,Great host and great kitchen for cooking by yourself.
6348110,526777970,9/9/2019,Ciara was an ideal host. Room is clean and cosey. Conveniently located near to the bus lines taking you directly in the city (30 mins approx.). Would highly recommend for short or long term stays.
6348110,544545771,10/10/2019,"Wonderful experience! I am staying here for more than a month.
Location: Very convenient: with many stores nearby, including Tesco and SuperValu; many restaurants, and a lot of buses available. Quiet, very safe residential area.
Host: Ciara and her family are very thoughtful, friendly and accommodating.
A great place for short-term or long-term stay!"
6381491,423867349,3/15/2019,The apartment is great! Close to a lot of the city but still far enough out you could sleep comfortably. Temple bar was about 10-15 minute walk. Apartment was presented much like it was described on the website. Would definitely stay again!
6381491,427295996,3/23/2019,"Great place, great location. Hallways of the building have a bit of a smell but the room did not. John was a great host would recommend this place highly."
6381491,436096450,4/12/2019,"Warm, welcoming apartment. Suitable for our short visit to Dublin."
6381491,439093896,4/18/2019,The location is excellent! The appartment was clean.
6381491,445480817,4/29/2019,Great place in a great location.
6381491,449299206,5/6/2019,Buen alojamiento y muy centrico
6381491,453605382,5/16/2019,"Great location, very walkable to
Anything you could want or need! Space is adequate for 4 adults, although a little small. Clean and feels secure."
6381491,458625391,5/26/2019,"This apartment is modest, but served its purpose well for our 4 travelers. Its location is superb and the space was clean and well kept. There is an overwhelming cigarette smell in the entry and hallway, but once you enter the apartment the cigarette smell is gone. I was hesitant because it is a ground level apartment, but there are 2 metal fences and a large gap separating the windows from the sidewalk, so we were able to comfortably sleep with the windows open. Quick responses from the host. Thanks for a great stay!"
6381491,468364490,6/12/2019,Good. Especially kitchen
6381491,469352962,6/14/2019,"Place was solid for a short stay. I wouldnt classify it as a modern space, as it is basic and comfortable. The building itself leaves much to be desired: older, 3 doors to open before you get to the apartment, and many wafting smells from surrounding apartments (I know this isnt controllable). The key pick up location is a bit inconvenient, as well. All told, though, it is a good central location for exploring Dublin."
6381491,470483163,6/16/2019,John's place was so clean and stylish! Was perfect for our weekend in Dublin. Was within walking distance to a parking lot and to amenities in Dublin. John was also so responsive and a get host!
6381491,472355006,6/19/2019,"Johns place was clean, stylish and close to the centre. Made the stay very nice and had everything we needed. It is a short walk to the main Dublin attractions."
6381491,473883439,6/22/2019,This place is great! If your staying for a few days its perfect due to its location. The place itself was clean and ready when we arrived. Checking out was easy and hassle free. The only thing really to take note of is that the building the Airbnb is located in smelled horrible but the room itself did not. Overall this place has all the essentials for a perfect stay in Dublin.
6381491,480707605,7/3/2019,"Nice space, great location. Would stay again."
6381491,483343105,7/7/2019,"Accommodation in Dublin are expensive, but this one doesn't worth the money.
It was clean, very well located and the host was very reactive to answer all the questions.
Though for the money would have expected a higher standard. The common part were a bit dodgy and very smelly, kinda exotic food. The apartment is in the ground floor along quite a busy and noisy road.
Again the accommodation is decent and the host quite welcoming and supportive. But that is not enough for a 4 star hotel price"
6381491,485755784,7/11/2019,"Central location, many hostels on the same street with airport bus stop. Accurate photos of tasteful Ikea interior however beds are uncomfortable and the road noise made it very hard to sleep even with the windows closed. Its is good value for Dublin so you get what you pay for."
6381491,502095096,8/4/2019,"Awesome place, 10~15min walk for temple bar. Good Location"
6381491,510046120,8/15/2019,Clean and perfectly located apartment
6381491,524710068,9/6/2019,The unit is located almost in the heart of the city and a walking distance to most of the city attractions.
6381491,528605921,9/13/2019,This place is close to the Connely Station. very convenient.
6381491,530709273,9/16/2019,"This is a perfect location close to everything. You can walk into the Temple Bar area and access the hop-on, hop-off bus within minutes. The airport shuttle will drop you off directly in front of building. Excellent place for our four-days in Dublin. The only criticism would be the smell in the front lobby and hallway area, it is quite strong and would  be intolerable for sensitive noses."
6381491,534155382,9/22/2019,"The place was very near to the center which is amazing and the check in process was also easy with the self check in instructions. However the apartment wasn't exactly as shown in pictures. Heating only worked at the livingroom but not in the room neither the hallway. Also, the power/plugs in the room didn't work either to charge the phones.  Hot water is good for a couple of showers but not for 4 people in the house."
6381491,537879056,9/29/2019,It was a good stay at this apartment
6381491,540929271,10/4/2019,"Nice stay, very clean and good location. No hot water for the shower is the only complaint"
6381491,548279844,10/17/2019,A bit like a hotel vibe... photos were a little misleading ç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6381491,559597436,11/4/2019,Nice flat in a perfect location
6381491,560340064,11/6/2019,This house is in an amazing location and perfect for the three of us. I would just note that to get the key you need to go to a different location about a 20 minute walk away.
6381491,564667759,11/16/2019,"Absolutely gorgeous little apartment! Everything you need is available in the kitchen. The beds can be used as singles or shift together for a double bed. 
The apartment is located just a few walking minutes from the events of the city, we basically walked everywhere! Tesco is just around the corner and the bus station is right in front of the building.
I especially appreciated the communication with John, he answered every question within a couple of hours and any issues where fixed immediately. 
The only downside was, that we spotted some hairs on the floor and the tub, but theres also a vacuum cleaner available in the apartment so we fixed that."
6385487,424801168,3/17/2019,"This place was great. Great location, perfect for 2 people. John and Martina were quick to respond and offered so much help on transportation options and things to do around the city!"
6385487,426194237,3/20/2019,"Great location, and awesome host!"

6385487,445392338,4/29/2019,"Johns place was absolutely perfect...perfect set up, perfect location, perfect amenities, and perfect hospitality. John responded immediately with any questions or needed tips that I had. Its a quick 5 minute walk to Temple Bar. John even provided his own website for all of the must dos while in Dublin. Would definitely recommend his place to anyone. You will not be disappointed!"
6385487,450823673,5/10/2019,"John made everything so easy to be a guest with directions from the airport, being met when we got off the bus and shown to his flat. He also shared tons of great recommendations for places to eat, where to shop, transit, etc. The flat is a great home base for exploring Dublin. The flat itself was quiet, clean, had soaps, shampoo, coffee and teas (which really helped as we were traveling very light). John was very responsive and friendly in his messages. Martina was very kind in showing us to the place. If you have back problems the mattress might not work for you.  Everything else was great and we would stay again! Thanks John!"
6385487,455813322,5/20/2019,Best host ever!
6385487,476050292,6/25/2019,"Great little apartment in a wonderful location. Kept up great, and a really calm place."
6385487,482424409,7/6/2019,"Amazing location - 5min walk from all the traditional Irish action! We stayed here for a concert at Croke Park. It was only a 20min easy walk. 
Johns place is handy, clean and extremely great value for money! Bed was comfy, shower nice and hot, and even had access to coffee machine!"
6385487,516345423,8/24/2019,I loved Johns place! The place is right at the Center of the city and at a walking distance from most of the places. John is a wonderful person. He is probably one of the best host I have stayed with. From welcoming with a fantastic wine bottle to giving tips about everything he made sure we make the most of our trip! Thank you John for being a wonderful host.
6385487,541524342,10/5/2019,Great location! Exceptional host. Best local tips and guidance ever.
6385487,545481027,10/12/2019,"John was THE most amazing host we've had.  His place was just as expected and very cozy.  Everything from hot water and security was very accurate.  Never had any issues.  The building itself was very quiet and we slept like babies for the nights we were there.  John was not able to personally check us in, but had a trusted friend pick us up from the bus stop and walk us over - a very welcoming feeling as guests.  He was the very thoughtful of our vacation and even gave us a special gift for us upon arrival.  His guide was very helpful as well in finding local restaurants.  I'd highly recommend John's place and thanks for being such a great host and now friend.  Keep in touch!"
6385487,560980481,11/8/2019,"If you want to be within walking distance of all that Dublin has to offer, stay here! John is an extremely attentive host who was always quick to respond with any questions or issues we had. The hot water is a little tricky and is the only thing we had any trouble with while we were there, but once we figured it out all was well! The apartment is small, so make sure you're okay with being a bit cozy!"
6396228,419098460,3/3/2019,Brian is so very thoughtful and the loft is so quaint and warm! We absolutely loved the stay!!
6396228,420931108,3/8/2019,"Brian is a great host, and his place is excellent. Definitely the place to stay around Dublin."
6396228,423200808,3/13/2019,"Irish hospitality at its best, Brian went out of his way to accommodate. Lovely, comfortable, and stylish apartment with great views, walking distance to everything in Howth. Very handy to have used his Tesla Model - 3 airport service too, a great trip!"
6396228,424241987,3/16/2019,"Fantastic stay on Howth. The space could not have had a better location , adjacent the harbour and only steps away from fantastic restaurants and a great pub. 
Brian was an amazing host, recommended two of howths best restaurants and they fully lived up to his reviews. Must try everything at Octuppussys and Aqua was a great finish to the weekend.
A wonderful place to wander around the town and the cliff walk was a definite highlight.
Cannot say enough in terms of thanks to Brian for making this little rendezvous very special and one that will always be remembered."
6396228,424831367,3/17/2019,Wonderful place! Highly recommend
6396228,426170893,3/20/2019,The apartment is beautiful and perfectly located.  And Brian is a wonderful host.  Highly recommend!
6396228,426918094,3/22/2019,"Brians place is outstanding. Perfect location in Howth & felt incredibly safe for us two solo female travelers! Brians place had so many little touches that made it feel much more comfortable than any hotel could ever offer. Brian was so responsive and helpful but we still felt independent. It was so nice knowing he was a quick message away with any questions. He also suggested we take a cab to the airport rather than train into the city + bus/taxi to airport. This saved us so much time and money. Fast WiFi, Netflix & amazing coffee/tea options. Every little touch made it feel like home.. we didnt want to leave! Thank you Brian."
6396228,427232500,3/23/2019,"Brian was very responsive and went out of his way to make an early check-in possible for us.  I would definitely recommend working with Brian! The location can be a bit noisy on the main road, but you cant beat the close proximity to the best of Howth!"
6396228,427918695,3/24/2019,"This place was an absolute star find. The level of thought and detail put into the place by Brian is the best I have seen in an AirBnB. From the fluffy, scented towels to the stocked kitchen and diverse book collection. The suite was so comfortable and cosy. Brian was a very responsive and accommodating host and the location couldn't have been better. Would highly recommend and hope to stay there again."
6396228,429921728,3/29/2019,"We found Brians place very relaxing and enjoyable. Most of all Brian was welcoming and hospitable and his space was famously designed for leisure and relaxation. You can lay on the bed and enjoy watching and hearing the sounds of life go by below you (I read on the cushion in the windowsill, a well) along with nice candles and aromatherapy oils ready to go by the bed. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics to get a handy yummy breakfast and I indulged in the face mask in the bathroom ""forgotten amenities"" drawer. Brian gave us a great tour around the island, bringing us back to a previously fog-covered spot to make sure we got the view in, walked us to Martello Tower, and walked us to the ""trailhead"" on a short hike we selected to get us started in the right direction. It was an easy 20 minutes drive to the airport, and he knew how to time it right with traffic and our departure time. Very relaxing stay, Brian made everything easy and very communicative by text about all our plans. And he has the best dogs ever if you want to meet them. Thank you!"
6396228,431637634,4/1/2019,"Brians place is just as great as he is. His place being our first stay on our trip really set the bar high. I just hope the other places we are going to can compare. 

Thanks again Brian!"
6396228,438712857,4/17/2019,A home away from home. This is our third stay at Brians studio apartment and we look forward to returning. The accommodation is extremely comfortable and Brians attention to detail makes you feel at home. The location is excellent overlooking Howth Harbour. Public transport is right outside the door. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks Brian.
6396228,442344907,4/23/2019,Brian was an excellent host! We had a lovely stay in Howth!
6396228,444829483,4/28/2019,"Brians apartment is awesome! A really unique, thoughtful, creative, homely and spacious place to relax.  Brians communication and hospitality really went beyond expectation - friendly, helpful, responsive - his dogs were really friendly too! Highly recommend, you really wont be disappointed."
6396228,446759506,5/2/2019,Highly highly recommended.
6396228,449736635,5/7/2019,"What a beautiful apartment, in the perfect spot.  Brian has created a great space, spotlessly clean and very cosy with lots of extra thoughtful touches, to make our stay so easy and comfortable.  A wonderful place to watch the world go by, but close to everything we needed.  A 3 minute walk to the Dart and 25 minutes into the center of Dublin.  Just 25 easy minutes from the ferry port.  Plenty of great bars and restaurants within minutes of the apartment.  Definitely the place to stay when visiting Dublin, without the city hustle and bustle! Thanks Brian."
6396228,450032220,5/8/2019,Brian's place was great! Awesome location within walking distance to everything we needed. Extremely friendly host and gave us plenty of good suggestions. Would definitely stay if we're ever back in the area!
6396228,451708230,5/12/2019,This apartment is in a fantastic location and the host is very helpful and friendly. Brian has thought of everything needed for a comfortable stay and gave  some great tips on which restaurants to eat . You will not be disappointed. Cant wait to go back .
6396228,454428055,5/18/2019,"Brians place was wonderful and even better than the photos. Giant windows that open to the harbor , everything seems to be in the perfect spot.  Seafood , open markets , coffee shops and quiet little bars full of locals are steps away.  The towns people will know you soon and you will feel just like a resident.

The best part of the whole trip was Brians local tips and his limo service. For a better price than a taxi , he is a certified chauffeur and He will drive you where you need to go long or short, in a beautiful luxury black Tesla. We felt like royalty as Brian drove us to the front door of attractions and events, Jumped out and let us out of the back seat like celebrities. I think I  even saw a paparazzi snap our photo at  Giants Causewayù thinking we were someone famous. As mentioned the price for this service is fair and well worth it . Dont rent a car! Rent Brian. He will handle it all. 

We can not wait to return. 
Thanks ,
Cayce and Sarah"
6396228,455082301,5/19/2019,"Brian is the perfect host and his apartment is beautiful. Tastefully decorated with generous facilities. Its the perfect location for a quiet weekend by the sea or a trip to Dublin, with the train only a 5 minute walk from the house and a 15 minute journey into the city."
6396228,457536910,5/24/2019,"Lovely apartment in a very central part of Howth, near to the DART, hill walks and restaurants. Brian is a lovely host with a lot of attention to detail and is a good communicator."
6396228,458545596,5/26/2019,"The apartment is lovely. So homey and comfortable. Great big bed and in a great spot so close to everything. 

We didnt get to meet Brian, but he was in contact with us during our stay in the apartment. 

Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here."
6396228,460109241,5/28/2019,Brian has a beautiful place that is very open and has lovely views. He is very helpful and makes your stay very pleasant.  Great communicator.
6396228,461232812,5/31/2019,"What a cool spot right along the harbor in Howth! We stayed here to be close enough to Dublin to get there with ease (thanks to the DART station < 10 minutes walk away) but to be a little quieter and easier to park our rental car. Howth itself has lots of cute seafood restaurants and cliff walks nearby that are worth a visit in their own right.

Brian was a fantastic host - supplied us with extra essentials for our baby, had fresh juice and milk/yogurt and coffee pods ready to go for us.  He is fast at communicating and accessible, yet you have your privacy with a separate entrance to the unit.

You do pay a little bit for the great location to getting some road noise from the main street below, if you are a light sleeper. But that proximity is really awesome otherwise!"
6396228,461777713,6/1/2019,"In a word - Exceptional!  Brian's place is exactly as pictured.  However, we had no idea the gracious hospitality that was to come.  Special amenities and thoughtful touches abound - yogurt and fruit for a quick snack; milk for coffee or tea; and cookies!  Brian's place is stylish and clean.  The bed and linens - extremely comfortable.  Perfect place for an overnight - or longer stay - Howth is a city full of wonderful surprises!  The value for this bnb is outstanding.  Also, Brian is excellent at keeping in touch and answering questions in a timely manner.  I cannot say enough good about this Airbnb! Thank you so much, Brian, for a wonderful stay - we're already planning a return!  
P.S. - We also loved your doggies so much!  
Chris & Jim"
6396228,462616559,6/2/2019,"Wow. This place was amazing. Sad we only had one day here. Howth is definitely worth checking out and when you do, you should stay here. Cute apartment, beautifully decorated. Great bed and sheets, slept really well. Wonderful extra touches like Irish yogurt and some milk, oj, tea, coffee, hot chocolate....the list goes on. Brian also gave us great recommendations of where to eat and grab a drink. For an extra fee, hell pick you up and drop you off in his Tesla (based on availability; hes a licensed chauffeur) and that was so worth it. He gave us a nice little tour around town before getting to the apt. Hospitality at its best. Was such a perfect way to end our trip and rejuvenate before the long trip home."
6396228,463959778,6/4/2019,"Absolutely lovely apartment and fabulous location, if you're looking for a little quiet after the crowds in Dublin.   Brian's place is top notch with a very comfortable bed, stylishly decorated and smartly designed.  Delightful."

6396228,469307902,6/14/2019,"Comfy bed, lots of natural light (dark shades as well to get good sleep), and Brian was very accommodating for our needs. The apartment is very close to restaurants on the west pier as well as the DART station to get into Dublin or anywhere else."
6396228,471852359,6/18/2019,"Brian is a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful. He has a great knowledge of the local area which he is more than willing to share. 

The location is perfect and Howth is a stunning place.

Would definitely recommend this place to anybody.

Top marks."
6396228,472761528,6/20/2019,First of all Brian is a top shelf host who greeted us in person and showed us his lovely (and perfectly located) loft in Howth. The attention to details set the bar very high and I wish all Airbnb hosts were as amazing as he was!! We loved the loft and it had everything and more that we needed. Great recommendations for things to do and where to eat. I felt like I was on a seaside vacation - so relaxing and the Tesla trip to the airport was soooo much better than any other alternative. This is a must stay if you are any where near Dublin. Thank you Brian 
6396228,474457053,6/23/2019,"No wonder Brian is a superhost! Well deserved. His loft is perfect for two, open and comfortable, with an amazing location in a great seafood restaurant town. But what stands out is Brians love of hospitality, combined with his chauffeur (in a Tesla!) and concierge services. We highly recommend booking Brians professional, personable chauffeur services, wherever your travel plans take you. They will elevate your holiday stay ì both coming and leaving ì and make you want to start all over again!"
6396228,476477851,6/26/2019,"Brian is a lovely, thoughtful host and the apartment is a real treat - I would definitely recommend!"
6396228,477482815,6/28/2019,"We were thrilled when Brian showed us in the flat for check in. The place was everything we could have hoped and I only wish we had booked the space to spend more days there. Great location, all the amenities. It felt like a really special spot to vacation. Brian was an exceptionally great host. Very friendly and personable. We felt at home right away."
6396228,483168711,7/7/2019,Brian's place is amazing. I would highly recommend it. Superb location and views and an overall beautiful loft too.

6396228,512349769,8/18/2019,This apartment was perfect.  Right in the heart of Howth and withl all the amenities needed.   We were delighted with the treats and food left for us. Nothing was forgotten.  Many thanks and we hope to return again soon.
6396228,515818852,8/23/2019,"Brian's place is just simply amazing.  Things we loved: the huge selection of books; the large windows looking out on the port and greenway with window seats and pillows; the super comfortable large bed; the fact that he made a bed on the couch for our daughter; Brian meeting us in person at 2:00 am to check us in (sorry, Brian!); all the yummy foods he had in the place for us like yogurts, fruit, granola, cereal, juice and milk; the coffee and tea selection; the cool artwork; the huge shower; how amazingly clean and organized everything was; all the little touches like the ""wine wipes"", marshmallows for the hot chocolate, hygiene supplies of all kinds; the fact that he booked our taxi for us since we didn't have cell service; the fast internet; the location right on the main street of the harbor. I could go on.  This is just one of those BnB's that you can really tell the owner put a lot of love into.  The space just felt good!  Howth was also a lovely town.  Lots of great shorter walks in town and an amazing longer walk out onto the head.  We had wonderful meals in Howth as well.  If you are going to Howth, stay here!  Thank you, Brian."
6396228,516430167,8/24/2019,"Excellent location in Howth, very clean and comfortable with thoughtful added touches. Superb host."
6396228,517179089,8/25/2019,"Fab, stylish space, perfect location. Brian is very helpful and quick at responding."
6396228,519774311,8/29/2019,"If you're considering only one night in Howth, I'd add another day or two! You'll quickly fall in love with Brian's place and this adorable sea town. (If anything stay for the seafood!!) We actually used Howth as our home base and conveniently took the train into Dublin for the day. You could easily do multiple day trips from this location. Brian's place is so comfortable with a cool and stylish touch and walking distance to the cliff walk, restaurants and shops. He met us when we first arrived and gave us great recommendations for Dublin as well as Howth. Brian even offered to chauffeur us to the airport in his Tesla for honestly what we would pay for a taxi - such a nice convenience! We can't speak more to the hospitality, delicious food and overall charm of Howth. Book it."
6396228,522580535,9/2/2019,"The only thing I would point out is that it can be a little noisey, but gets quiet and doesn't effect sleep"
6396228,523818721,9/4/2019,"Thought this suburban chic Airbnb was perfect for our needs. Right in the heart of Howth, surrounded by a plethora of restaurants and pubs/bars, its an ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Brian was an excellent host and made us feel very welcome....we hope to return."
6396228,524575170,9/6/2019,Brians is a great place and he is a top bloke brilliant communication and nice touches in the apartment
6396228,530722479,9/16/2019,"This place was amazing. As a solo traveler it was the perfect space for me to reenergize. While clean and organized, it was the little touches that made it rather magical: yogurt and fresh fruit in the refrigerator, binoculars in one of the window seats, a jar of mini marshmallows to accompany the selection of hot chocolates. 

My trip got off to a rocky start due to a delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flight to Dublin. Brian was gracious and accommodating when I had to check in a day late and met me at the door when I finally arrived. I instantly felt at home and was able to relax after the stressful extra traveling. 

I miss it already."
6396228,531856763,9/18/2019,I highly recommend staying at Brian's Airbnb. My husband and I stayed here for our last night in Ireland. Brian was a kind and welcoming host. He was thoughtful with the amenities that he provided. Our only regret was not allowing more time to stay and explore Howth for more than one night.
6396228,536322669,9/26/2019,Good communication. Nice space.
6396228,536715927,9/27/2019,"Brian really embodies the spirit of Airbnb. From picking us up at the airport at 6 am in his Tesla to making sure we knew where we were going for the next part of our trip, Brian was a wonderful host and helped make our trip very memorable."
6396228,537335778,9/28/2019,"We had a wonderful stay at Brians beautiful apartment. The photos do not do the space and all the beautiful touches justice. Brian is a really thoughtful host who went out of his way to make our stay special. The flat has absolutely everything you could need including a bathroom that is stocked with so many helpful items. 

We found it a very romantic place to stay and loved every minute. Better than any hotel. Do not hesitate to choose this Airbnb if visiting Dublin or Howth."
6396228,538092695,9/29/2019,"Great little flat, stylish and well furnished.  All the comforts of home and nice views of the waterfront. Access to plenty of restaurants, close by, is a bonus."

He greets you at the door and shows you around the apartment, answering any questions you may have about the home or area (he has great restaurant tips too!). Street parking was extremely easy right outside the front door, and the location was perfect for getting to the airport. Brian provided all the amenities you could need, and has put so many thoughtful touches into the space it truly feels like a home. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you, Brian!"
6396228,557553267,11/1/2019,"Brian is certainly worthy of being classified as a super host. Brian himself is a gentleman and communicates before and throughout the stay. His apartment is a hidden gem and the touches he has make it home from
Home. Thank you so much Brian for letting us stay in your perfect apartment and for all the recommendations. We will be back and will definitely be recommending to others."
6396228,558887329,11/3/2019,Lovely apartment to stay in 
6396228,560607929,11/7/2019,"Of all the Airbnbs I've stayed in, this little flat in Howth is definitely one of my favorites! Cozy, eclectic, and comfortable with many thoughtful (and much appreciated) amenities. Brian is an exceptionally warm and welcoming host. Highest recommendations!"

6406867,423782684,3/15/2019,We loved our stay at Dorothys place! Located close to the city but quiet and in a great neighborhood close to parks and cute restaurants. She responded very quickly as well!
6406867,424828997,3/17/2019,"It's just like the pictures, a cozy loft with a great view. It has all the necessary. The location is perfect, just 15 mins walking from the city centre in a nice and calm neighbourhood. Dorothy was nice and helpful when we asked her infos. I would definitely stay again at her place if I ever go back to Dublin!"
6406867,426557504,3/21/2019,"Perfect for a short break. Location not the nicest on the outside street although lovely little park with a lake on the doorstep.  Easy enough walk into town and plenty of street parking. You need a pass but Dorothy arranges same for us without a fuss. 

Couple of great little eateries on the doorstop. La Pausa for breakfast and Wood Fire Cafe offering awesome pizzas and pasta.  Both at the other end of Blessington Street. 

Dorothy was amazingly quick to respond to any request and even went out of her way to do an 8 hour round trip to get the studio ready for us as her cleaner did a no show!!  Didnt cause us a problem as was able to leave cases etc but shows her commitment to looking after her guests. Added to that she kept in touch throughout our stay to ensure we were okay.  

Value for money was excellent in such an expensive city.  

Thanks Dorothy."
6406867,430880796,3/31/2019,"Loved the location and the studio. The view from the apartment was an adorable park where locals came to catch up with friends and feed ducks. Its a 10 minute walk to downtown and in a quiet area which was super great. We had our car with us, so Dorothy was kind enough to provide us free parking. She was an attentive host and we enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend"
6406867,433402677,4/6/2019,Host is very accommodating and helpful. Location is close to the heart of the city without the hustle and bustle/loud noises that come along with staying right downtown.

We were within walking distance of everything we did in Dublin (Literally never got on a bus). The view out the window was our favorite part and my favorite afternoon reading spot with a glass of wine. Book it!"
6406867,443655871,4/26/2019,The apartment is really stylish and the building is beautiful. The street is quiet and is a short walking distance to city center. Deirdre was very responsive. We enjoyed our stay.

Street parking is difficult & needs to be arranged beforehand. We found a good safe lot called ""Euro Car- Eccles Street"" under the local hospital just a 10 minute walk away."
6406867,463377525,6/3/2019,We had a great stay in Deidres studio. Quiet area not far from the centre.

She was flexible with her check in time and did her best to accommodate in any way she could.

The location of the cozy residence is about a 10 min walk from Temple Bar area and very easy to navigate. It sits by the entrance of a nice, quiet park.

Highly recommend this place!"
6406867,485114747,7/10/2019,Overall the place was very nice. It was smaller than the pictures lead on. It was perfect for two people because we were out all day and just needed a place to sleep. She was quick to respond to my messages if we needed anything. It is a bit of a walk to the attractions of Dublin so bring your walking shoes.
6406867,486993549,7/13/2019,"We loved our stay at Deirdres, the location is wonderful with the beautiful basin just next door. Everything we could have wanted. We walked everywhere we needed to go and enjoyed the local Georgian architecture."

The space is on the small side but perfect for a stay in Dublin with your other half. It was really easy to move around the city."
6406867,493279102,7/22/2019,Nice comfortable room.
6406867,495096912,7/25/2019,"Everything as described in the listing, no complaints whatsoever."
6406867,500614360,8/2/2019,"We stayed there for 3 nights and D. always responded very quickly at any questions we had! Super convenient when you want to have your own little kitchen.
Easy to reach near a little Park!
Thank you again!!!"
6406867,504232977,8/7/2019,I do not recommend this apartment
6406867,506259810,8/10/2019,"This place is smaller than it looks in the pictures. The neighborhood was very loud throughout the night, each night, and seemed very transitional (people passed out on the street). It is within walking distance of many points of interest. The cleaning person needs to do an inventory of amenities and organize the little bit of closet space so there are places for the renter to unpack.  We drank instant coffee, and had to fix the shower door so it would stay closed. She was quick to respond to our texts, but really didnt have any solutions to our issues.   Would not stay here in the future."
6406867,508717099,8/13/2019,Everything was all right.
6406867,510709392,8/16/2019,Nice location.
6406867,516289999,8/24/2019,You can expect a nice a functional space in an area of town with close access to the main areas off Dublin. The park next to the apartment is beautiful although the birds are quite load at sunrise
6406867,519335159,8/28/2019,"Deirdre is a great host and apartment is situated in a perfect place! Close to everything, in a calm neighborhood with a great view:) definitely recommend staying there"
6406867,521927616,9/1/2019,A wonderfully comfortable apartment in a great location! Also stunning views onto a beautiful  park! Deirdre was very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend to stay!
6406867,524201875,9/5/2019,"Location was great, with easy access from airport and a 10 minute walk to the city centre. Getting access to the property could not have been easier, with Deidre responding to my messages within minutes. The bed was very comfortable and although the flat faced the road, it was in a quiet street."
6406867,526021795,9/8/2019,"Clean apartment, comfortable bed, good location for walking to town. Perfectly fine but nothing special. Lacks many details and is very loud at night, you can hear everyone in the flats around you and there's a lot of street noise. Host asked us to pretend to be her friends if her neighbours ask so I'm guessing she isn't supposed to rent it out, was sort of awkward. The shower is pretty horrible, the water pressure is weak, took me 10 minutes just to get my hair wet enough to wash, got to the point where I didn't even bother. We asked 2 weeks early if we could check in a couple hours early because we were coming off a 30 hour travel time, she said we could leave our bags with the cleaner (which we were not comfortable with) but she could not accommodate us early. As I said, perfectly fine but nothing special."
6406867,527698613,9/11/2019,"This is a cute, stylish studio/flat in Dublin. Lovely view. A bit removed from attractions, but still very walkable. I thought it was a good value."
6406867,528640231,9/13/2019,"Location location location. 1 easy bus from the airport, near theatres, and a short walk to Trinity college. Great for a quick stay in Dublin. Also, huge ceilings!"
6406867,529923871,9/15/2019,The flat is in walking distance to Dublin downtown and therefore well-located. It has a big window with a very nice view into the park. Communication with Dorothee was perfect. I enjoyed may stay.
6406867,531426389,9/17/2019,Place was in the heart of things in a quiet neighbourhood.
6406867,532249000,9/19/2019,"Deirdre's place is perfect! It's an easy walk to local pubs, restaurants, Trinity campus, Museums, Dublin Castle, and more. It's also really adorable, and is right next to a beautiful park, which was a nice surprise when I arrived in Dublin. Her place is very clean, smelled amazing, and had everything I needed."
6406867,540360669,10/3/2019,"Great location and cozy little apartment ideal for a action packed few days in Dublin.
We walked to all our tours within a 15 to 25 minute stroll or if we wanted to go out for a meal or drink. We found one pub that was good value and it was nice to be welcomed by the locals plus farewelled on our last day. We had a rental car so there was plenty of parking outside the building and Deirdre provided parking permits. Deirdre was always available and checked on us daily, she even offered us a free night if our flight was being delayed/cancelled due to the tornado that was due to hit on our last day.
We would definitely stay here again if we get the chance to visit Dublin again."
6406867,544082796,10/9/2019,Not the best Air Bnb experience we have had.  In future we would stay on southern side of Dublin as I believe this is a better area.  The walk to Temple bar is quite long and a bit concerning. Some maintenance issues when we arrived did spoil our stay in Dublin.
6406867,546233501,10/13/2019,Flat was great! Take note of the fact that this does require a flight of stairs which is noted but may not be understood by some. The first floor in the U.K. is NOT the ground floor. Stairs were not a problem for us and the space was as described. Its a small studio but the space is used well and its perfect for a couple or single person. Theres a charming park next door. Transport is easy in Dublin but you will need to walk a couple blocks to the bus stop. Easy to get around and close enough but may not be walkableù to the action for some. Maybe a 15-20 minute walk to city center/temple bar area or a 5-10 bus ride. Space was clean and communication was easy and quick. Great stay!
6406867,553084847,10/23/2019,"Deirdre's place is exactly as shown in the photos.  Deirdre was a really good communicator and allowed me to check in early after an overnight flight, which was much appreciated!  The apartment is about a 10 minute walk straight down the street from the more touristy area.  The Spar grocery store around the corner was great for supplies and there's a fairly new cafe called Clement & Pekoe less than a five minute walk down the street.  Breakfast at Lovinspoon, less than a 10 minute walk down the street, was also great!  Deirdre's place offers great value in Dublin for solo travelers (as I was) and couples."
6406867,554468501,10/26/2019,"Thanks again for a fantastic stay at your beautiful apartment. The location was perfect to walk 10min to the city centre and close to walk to all the main city attractions. Everything we could of asked for. Deirdre our host was incredibly informative and regularly checked in and made every possible effort. Deirdre provided recommendations for food, activities and many more. Any questions were answered very promptly. Best value for money."
6406867,557156779,10/31/2019,Great little studio in a beautiful location on the local park. Dierdra was very helpful and always responded quickly.
6406867,560275826,11/6/2019,A nice studio apartment in Dublin. Close to many restaurants and things to see. Deirdre is very attentive to her customers needs. Very quick to respond.
6406867,561982007,11/10/2019,"A wonderful spot! Close to anything you need and an easy bus ride to the city central.
Lots of fun"

6424374,488651602,7/15/2019,"Rosemarie goes out of her way to try to make your stay a good one.    Very responsive in communicating before, during, and after the stay.   Able to accommodate some smaller last minute tweaks to our plans and went the extra mile to ensure the place was clean after the last renters.   House is in a great location (close to the city and easy access to major highways and bus stations), on a quite / low traffic street, and has a private driveway   which has plenty of room."
6424374,532084273,9/19/2019,"The house was perfect for our use, communication was brilliant and i couldn't fault Rosmarie from start to finish she was a pleasure to deal with. Thank you."

6429712,458587129,5/26/2019,"Yvonne's house is about 20 mins away (by bus) from the city center, it's quite close to the bus station but may need to check bus timing all the time. 

Communal areas especially the kitchen and the garden is spacious. 
The neighborhood area is quiet and silent."
6429712,462701347,6/2/2019,"if you are looking for a very warm welcome, tasty specials and good place, you are right here"
6429712,471909948,6/18/2019,"Yvonne and her family made this vacation a wonderful trip to remember.  Their home was our haven to return to after busy days exploring.  We were greeted kindly upon arrival and our suitcases were carried upstairs to a very clean room.  All our travel questions were answered patiently and knowledgeably by Derek.  Our privacy was respected and yet we were welcomed to join them at their table, which we did often in the mornings....healthy breakfasts included in this amazing rate!  We felt right at home and enjoyed this family, including their 3 fine sons and 2 cats.  If we ever return to Ireland we will stay here!"
6429712,476876055,6/27/2019,"A nice quiet house located in a beautiful neighborhood of Dublin but well communicated with the downtown by bus. The room was clean, bright, spacious and comfortable, with no luxuries but you don't miss anything. The wi-fi goes perfectly, so you can work or watch movies or be connected all time. The hosts are very kind and worried that you are comfortable, you can share tasty breakfast with them and their lovely boys -and cats.  They made the stay even more pleasant."
6429712,484107909,7/8/2019,Lovely host and accommodation. Just a short bus or tram journey away from Dublins city centre. Host was very helpful at giving tips on what to do in the city and was a pleasure to stay with. Would 100% recommend.
6429712,504246323,8/7/2019,"Yvonne and her family are so friendly, they provide a lot of facilities and help. It has been a good experience"
6429712,515614332,8/23/2019,"Yvonne and family are so kind and friendly. They helped us settle into a new city. Their house is clean and has amazing amenities. The room is just as clean and cozy as advertised. The bus stop is right in front of the house so you can easily access the city. 

She went out of the way to get a crib for our baby so that he can sleep okay at night.

In short, we came as strangers and left as a family. I will truly be grateful for whatever she did for us."
6450993,419058966,3/3/2019,"Great stay. Accommodations were good, location was very quiet but handy and the hospitality was excellent."
6450993,423190934,3/13/2019,"great place to stay. very close to everything. one thing is the kitchenette is only a toaster over and microwave, so a little difficult for proper cooking. it's not a problem for me, but if you want to eat in it may be a challenge."
6450993,429544606,3/28/2019,"Eamons bedsit was an excellent place to stay. Impeccably clean, well-locates, and exactly as advertised. I would certainly stay with him again."
6450993,431924169,4/2/2019,This space exceeded my expectations. The room was small but clean with a cozy feel. The attached bath had a wonderful little shower and the kitchen appliances were perfect for preparing /reheating takeaway. The location of this place is ideal. Its located in a highly safe-feeling area of town yet only a short walk to the trinity college area. Note** apple maps misidentified the address as being a little down the street but (Hidden by Airbnb) maps got it right.
6450993,433940152,4/7/2019,"It was nice, clean and quiet place to stay. Eamon was waiting for me on time as promised. I appreciate good neighborhood - close to the Aircoach bus stop (fast and reliable connection to the airport) and a hotel which hosted a congress I've attended. Thank you veru much, Eamon, take care."
6450993,441658086,4/22/2019,"Eamon's place is a perfect location for solo travelers!!  I found the neighborhood to be safe and very walkable to nice parks, restaurants while not being in the middle of all of the madness.  Most of all Eamon was very hospitable and responsive.  I highly recommend!"
6450993,445877621,4/30/2019,Great little place with everything a lone traveler would need.
6450993,449342891,5/6/2019,"Friendly host, good communication. Quiet location, ideal for my purposes, would use again."
6450993,452891335,5/14/2019,This is very clean and convenient location for a single traveler.  A very safe neighborhood.
6450993,455909613,5/20/2019,"The bedsit was very clean and comfortable and the one I stayed in (#4) was just perfect for a solo traveler.  I always felt safe both in the bedsit and in the neighborhood.  Public transportation stops (both buses and LUAS), grocery stores and restaurants were within walking distance. 
Eamon responded promptly to all my emails and provided me lots of information regarding Dublin and the area.  Check in/out was uncomplicated. The bedsit included a little kitchenette with a toaster oven , microwave, small refrigerator, sink, assortment of dishes and supplies to make coffee and tea. 
I will definitely consider staying at Eamons again if I travel to the Dublin area."
6450993,460113681,5/28/2019,"I guess the start of my stay sums up the rest of it.  Caught the bus from the airport which was running a bit late, walked around the corner from the neighbouring street and saw Eamon standing out the front.  Much to my embarrassment hed sent me a couple of messages which Id managed to miss.  On entering my bedsit I was almost scared to put my bags down, it really was that clean.  It wasnt big, but more than makes up for its size
with its comprehensive range of facilities and very clever design.  Eamon is a terrific host, full of information and tips.   Before my stay he was good enough to send a lot Id really interesting information about Dublin including comprehensive  location directions, making the property very easy to find.  Its very close to the 145 which heads right through the middle of the city and departs about every 10 minutes, is about 10 minutes away from the Charlemont stop, as well as being within easy walking distance to a variety of dining options as well as a large supermarket.  If I return to Dublin I do hope this AirBNB is available."
6450993,463916187,6/4/2019,"Eamon's place in a great location for visitors to Dublin and Eamon is an extraordinary host. You can stay in comfort and walk easily to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green and many of the main museums. You are also close to buses to get around town and to and from the airport. Don't miss walking over to the many restaurants at Ranelagh Village."
6450993,467386404,6/10/2019,"Weiterzuempfehlen, sauber, freundlich, gute Lage, netter Gastgeber. Alles gut!"
6450993,476458185,6/26/2019,"Eamons place is nice and cozy and perfect for a visit to Dublin. I think there are other Airbnb rooms on the property but wasnt able to hear them from my room. Nice touch of mini kitchen, motion sensor lights in the hall, and cozy personal living room. 15 min bus ride to downtown and maybe 25-30 min walk. Close to st Stephens Green. In my top 5 Airbnbs Ive stayed at."
6450993,481800144,7/5/2019,"Excellent apartment in a gorgeous area of Dublin. This apartment has everything you need, the wifi is excellent and its sparklingly clean.

6450993,490919350,7/19/2019,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Eamon's  and will strongly recommend his place to all friends and family planning to visit Ireland. My stay truly exceeded all expectations. Eamon was not only helpful in sending me additional information and answering questions I had prior to arriving in Ireland as well as offering suggestions the day I arrived, but went out of his way to make me feel right with a few  personal touches and a very nice gesture at the end of my stay.  

Will definitely stay here again If I visit Dublin.


Thanks for everything Eamon"

As a single traveler, this property was perfect. The location was ideal - close enough to walk into town but also accessible to multiple forms of public transport.  
Highly recommend both the property and the host."
6450993,539445181,10/1/2019,"Eamon is a great host!  He was welcoming and helped me check in with my bags. The room and bathroom were very clean, equipped with a kitchenette for you to heat up your food and make tea/coffee, and the bed was comfortable. I truly appreciated the thoughtful touches of the Irish and Canadian flags in my room as well as the tea, coffee and biscuits available for you to enjoy. The location is quiet if you want to be away from the busy city centre yet close enough to walk or take transit to get there. Thank you Eamon for a wonderful stay!"

The place is very clean, there is every thing you need for stay.
Eamon have given me a lot of touristic information about Dublin and Ireland.
As I have said to Eamon - room is much better than on photos, so I recommend it! This was one of the best in my AirBNB experience!
Thank you, Eamon! 5 from 5 stars!"
6451020,425908770,3/19/2019,"Really good place, close to the city.
Even though I already knew Dublin I've received lots of information about the area near the apartment and about dublin"
6451020,428900198,3/26/2019,"This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. Everything is as it is described and more. I had the pleasure to meet Friar Eamon briefly when I checked in and he walked me around the bedsit and property,  giving a quick rundown of everything.

The apartment itself is conveniently located to all that Dublin had to offer. Transportation is nearby as well as many pubs and restaurants. If your travels take you to Dublin feel free to book with confidence."
6451020,437248801,4/14/2019,"I stayed in Eamons Bedsit No. 1 for three nights ì April 11-14. I selected it based on the wonderful reviews I read, and I was extremely happy with my choice. Upon reserving the bedsit last September, I received extensive information from Eamon regarding the suggested sites and locations to visit in Ireland and Dublin. Three weeks prior to my visit, he contacted me to confirm my time of arrival and provided me with several options for getting from the airport to the residence. I purchased AirCoach tickets (online) based on his suggestion, and it was nice to have transportation arranged in advance. Once I got off the AirCoach and began walking, I relied on my GPS rather than Eamons directions and walked passed his building. Fortunately, he was watching for me and caught my attention before I went too far. He was very thorough in showing me the amenities and took time to annotate a map for me with the routes to my first day destinations. I appreciated his understanding and patience as I was much later arriving from the airport than expected and I struggled a bit with figuring out the keys and the locks. The bedsit itself was immaculately clean, very comfortable, and the perfect size for a solo traveler. It was well-appointed and Eamon had clearly put a great deal of thought into assuring that travelers have all the things they might need. The little kitchen had everything but a stove, and Eamon offered the use of one upstairs should I want to cook. The shower had plenty of hot water, the pressure was excellent, and the bathroom was spotless. Best of all, Eamon was truly the perfect host ì he provided everything I needed and more, was engaged when necessary, but was completely respectful of my privacy, otherwise. I am entirely grateful to Eamon for his hospitality and his kindness, and I give him and Bedsit No. 1 the very highest of recommendations."
6451020,441948697,4/22/2019,Eamons place was excellent. Good safe and convenient location. All facilities available.

Located near a main artery into the city, and being only a few minutes walk away from St. Stephen's Green, you will yourself a short journey from the city center. However, being off of a quiet street, you will find that this studio offers the perfect balance of peace and quiet. Having just been renovated with high speed wifi, measured at around 15mbps upload and download, and safety features this venue is suitable for all modern communication and entertainment.

Eamon is a gracious host, unobtrusive yet available for any questions or needs but I didnt need anything because it is all there down to filtered water and tea."
6451020,523693659,9/4/2019,"Everything about my stay was accurate and clear. I didn't need to ask anything. If I had to, I'm very confident Eamon would have the answer."

It's very well located in a quiet street, close to shops and public transport and within walking distance to Grafton Street, Trinity College, the National Gallery etc. It was a nice place to come back to after full days of sightseeing.

What made it extra special was Eamon's warmth and relaxed friendliness, his helpful advice and being around when I needed anything - a perfect host."
6451020,540343238,10/3/2019,Eamon is nice and friendly
6451020,543184098,10/7/2019,I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to those traveling to the area. The neighborhood is very nice and Eamon is a great host.
6451020,546059136,10/13/2019,"The space is as described, its nice that there is a separate bedroom, bathroom and living space. The house is very calm and I had no issues with check in or during my stay. Communication with Eamon was superb as he obviously takes pride in the house and manages it proactively but not intrusively. This place is also in a very nice area of Dublin which felt very safe even coming back at night, had lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby and was also very convenient for the air coach."
6451020,550054381,10/18/2019,"Eamon's place is in a quiet neighbourhood just south of the Grand Canal. You can walk to St. Stephen's Green in about 15 mins, or take city buses or the LUAS to easily get to other tourist attractions. Eamon was a very attentive host and provided lots of helpful information and recommendations for the city. Eamon's bedsits will be my first choice when in Dublin again."
6451020,554423165,10/26/2019,"Fr. Eamon is an Amazing host; very thorough, provides clear and detailed instructions.. he's extremely hospitable (it might be an Irish thing- very warm, and welcoming). His place is in a really nice, safe, upscale neighbourhood- walking distance to trains/ busses/ grocery stores/ pubs/ restaurants/ shopping options in the town of Ranelagh. If I ever return to Ireland, I'm going back here."
6451020,556344797,10/29/2019,Lovely warm room in quiet location with easy access to bus and tram and local shops.
6451020,568310388,11/24/2019,"Eamon and his staff were so very helpful throughout my entire stay. Eamon was very thorough with instructions and if i had any questions, he was glad to help. I was so pleased with the studio, it was exactly what I needed as a solo traveler and the location was walking distance to nearby pubs, restaurants and the center of dublin if you dont mind longer distance & if not, an easy bus ride. I was very happy with everything and would easily stay again."
6455564,422513756,3/11/2019,"Wonderful place to stay, great localisation, hospitable house owners.   Clean, tidy and comfortable. Would not find anything better in such price."

6455564,458725598,5/26/2019,"Super kind hosts and perfect accommodation for a young couple. We had a great time exploring Ireland and staying at Colin's place for the week. 
We had a rental car and also went by bus to Dublin, Colin helped us out with any questions we had about transportation and suggestions/places to see.
Would absolutely recommend, and if we happen to visit Ireland again we will definitely be staying here again!"
6465408,463517818,6/3/2019,"Dear Maeve/Tom,

Thank you for having us in your tiny house. We really enjoyed it and for us it was a great time while we were visiting Dublin.

Especially we were happy about your hospitality, sitting in the garden and your wonderful breakfast.

Thanks a lot.
Best regards

They are wonderful hosts supplying a light breakfast and very helpful with tips to see and do in Dublin and surrounds. The spacious unit overlooks Maeves garden full of colour.
6465408,484673210,7/9/2019,"Maeve & Tom were superlative hosts! The airbnb ""cottage"" is lovely, stylish and quite comfortable, with a sliding door opening to a garden, and a large well appointed bath. The space was complemented by their warm hospitality, and enjoyable/humorous conversations. The house is nearby to busses that make the short journey to city center - and Tom's personal transport to the Guinness Storehouse was most appreciated! Many thanks for making our stay in Dublin so enjoyable!"

6465408,491500967,7/20/2019,"Maeve and Tom are great hosts and are very helpful with travel tips around Ireland. This was our first time in Ireland and the first time driving on the left side of the road, Maeve and Tom were very helpful by providing leap cards for local buses so we didn't have to worry too much about the traffic. The guesthouse is beautiful and comfortable with everything you need inside. The location is a quick bus ride into the city center so you can get as much of the city as you want without sacrificing comfort."
6465408,495577743,7/26/2019,Fantastic location and great people. If I'm ever in Dublin again this will be my go to!!

Maeve and Tom were so friendly and gracious. They gave us great tips on the city and bus tickets to get around which made getting around the city a breeze. Would definitely stay again and reccomend to anyone visiting Dublin!"

Breakfast was wonderful and plenty to eat each morning. 
The hosts gave us tips on places to go and helped us to navigate the public transportation with ease.
The location was easy to find and a close walk to the center of the city. Bus and Luas stops were very close by, in case your feet hurt from all the walking. 
You won't be disappointed with your stay with Maeve and Tom, they exceeded our expectations as Air BnB hosts. :)"
6465408,513413460,8/19/2019,"Maeve and Toms guest house was a wonderful place to stay for a weekend in Dublin! The house and gardens were as beautiful as the photos and were very comfortable  They went above and beyond to help us in any way they could during our stay and were more than happy to answer any questions we had! We chose to walk rather than take a bus most evenings, and it was a very simple 40 minute walk from the center of town. If public transportation is more your style, its very well connected to the entire city. I would 100% recommend their home to anyone!"
6465408,516434822,8/24/2019,Mauve and Toms place is a great! They were extremely helpful during our stay. The Airbnb is just a short bus ride to the main downtown area of Dublin making it a very convenient location. Id strongly recommend staying here.

6465408,530735658,9/16/2019,This place is as advertised.  It has a luxurious bathroom and a lovely garden right outside your door.  We had no trouble navigating the area and the LEAP bus stop was a half block away.  Bed was comfy and breakfast was great.  All in all we would recommend this place.
6469666,513994184,8/20/2019,This house was ideal for me working in the area

6474049,460475505,5/29/2019,"Thank you David! The place was exactly what I was hoping for - in a main area, walkable to most everything, clean, and comfortable. Communication before and during my stay was great as David promptly returned my messages and was very helpful."

6474049,475479639,6/24/2019,"This apartment is in a great location and is fine all around, but we had some trouble communicating with David and some huge issues with the cleanliness of the space. While this was resolved during our stay, it did put a damper on our trip."

6474049,495090648,7/25/2019,"The place was an amazing location, great apartment and David was so easy to communicate with! Highly recommend!"
6474049,515652869,8/23/2019,"Highly recommend this place! Its a great place to stay in while exploring Dublin. The location was fantastic and the space was very clean. Our flight landed at 10am, but we werent able to check in until 2pm. David told us about a hostile nearby we could leave our bags while we explored the area in the meantime. Everything worked out great! David even left a map where he drew out how to get to the Airbnb from the hostile. David was very helpful and responded quickly. Read a review that the location is noisy, however, we did not have any problems with noise. Only slight complaint is that the bed was a bit springy, but was still able to get a good nights sleep. Overall, it was a wonderful stay, great price, and even better location!"
6474049,527694795,9/11/2019,"Fully functional, located within walking distance to most recommended sights and a local store downstairs where you can grab cheap breakfast and coffee. There is a charming backyard garden for a morning workout too."
6474049,530867784,9/16/2019,Great location and within walking distance for food and shopping.
6474049,531849475,9/18/2019,"Simple, clean and a good location."
6474049,544508565,10/10/2019,Right in the center of everything!
6474049,547558379,10/15/2019,"The flat is clean , safe and well situated; the information clear and detailed. The only drawback was the noise because of the traffic in spite of the double-glazed windows."
6484506,425438554,3/18/2019,Beautiful house in a great part of town. Peter is a great host.
6484506,470552891,6/16/2019,"Lovely modern house in beautiful area, close to shops and local amenities. The main area of the house is great for socialising and Peter was great with communication throughout the weekend! Would recommend if staying in Dublin :)"
6484506,483269126,7/7/2019,"From start to finish our stay here was first class. 
 We was warmly welcomed by our hosts whom immediately made us feel comfortable in their home. 
 Any help we required before or during our stay was never a bother and was always offered before we even asked for, or needed it. This was the case for queries with the property and also the local area. 
  We was left alone with complete privacy and the full property to ourselves which positively added to the experience of our stay.

Overall our trip to Dublin was greatly enhanced due to the warm hospitality, professionalism and kindness of our hosts and the stay in their beautiful family home."
6484506,487841596,7/14/2019,Outstanding hospitality and house in a charming neighborhood.
6484506,490249069,7/18/2019,"While we enjoyed the spaciousness of Peters place for our group of 6, the place was dirty - mouldy food left on counter, rotting flowers, empty dirty food wrappers in kids bedrooms, piles of things under the beds and generally just unclean. We also found the place to be lacking in the amenities we have found standard in other Airbnbs - phone chargers, blow dryers, laundry soap, etc. The area is a bit of a walk to shops, coffee etc but did feel very safe and quiet. Overall a 3/5 - large and safe but needs a good scrub and some little touches."
6484506,492293047,7/21/2019,"Couldnt recommend Peters property more. Spacious, stylish, clean and a lovely place to spend the weekend. Peter was so quick to respond, so thoughtful and an excellent host!"
6494825,418987056,3/3/2019,We had a lovely stay in your apartment it was perfect for our family.  Our 3 kids felt totally at home.  I would highly recommend a stay here as the proxmity to the city is great.  The apartment itself is very well laid out and everything is thought of even a few games for the kids.  We will definately return
6494825,420961519,3/8/2019,Amazing location and a perfect apartment to see the whole city. Nicola gives amazing tips for the city and couldn't have been a better host!
6494825,421935175,3/10/2019,"With hotel prices in Dublin eye wateringly expensive,  this apartment is value for money.  A brilliant location and stunning accommodation,  its easily one of the best places to stay in Dublin.  Communication was excellent and check in was seamless. A fantastic flat that we will definitely use again."
6494825,422911837,3/12/2019,This apartment is fantastic î you cant ask for a better location and there is so much comfortable space in the apartment itself. Really a find in Dublin.
6494825,423522109,3/14/2019,"Fabulous place, spotless and very modern, super local spot. Highly recommend!"
6494825,424722748,3/17/2019,"This was an amazing apartment! Beautiful decor, very clean, and and an even better location. Nicola provided great recommendations for things to see, places to eat, etc. The apartment also came with lots of details of where to find extra blankets, how to turn on the heat, and other things of that sort that made the stay very easy. Overall, an amazing place for a weekend in Dublin!"
6494825,426183056,3/20/2019,Nicolas apartment is at a prime location in Dublin. It is close enough to everything but far enough away to avoid the crowd and noise of the temple bar area. I would highly recommend this apartment for a short stay or long stay in the heart of Dublin.
6494825,426883647,3/22/2019,Great place in central Dublin!
6494825,429928541,3/29/2019,Great central location and spacious flat.
6494825,430361273,3/30/2019,"What an incredible space! If you have an opportunity to stay here, DO!  The bedroom blocked out the noise of the city, but we found the city noise to be enjoyable when youre sitting in the living spaces.  I cant wait to return to stay here again!"
6494825,430985606,3/31/2019,Great location and spacious apartment! It definitely was loud in the living room on Saturday night (we were fairly warned) but it was dead quiet in the bedroom. We loved how much history the building had as well.
6494825,432885990,4/5/2019,"Everything about this accommodation is spot on. Comfort, style and location."
6494825,435446830,4/10/2019,"what a gorgeous place. so central, but safe and very well designed and finished. it was a real treat to stay somewhere as homely, but in the center of vibrant Dublin. a great find- I will be recommending it to family and friends and will definitely be back."
6494825,438265282,4/16/2019,"I grew up in Dublin but usually stay in the suburbs when we visit. Staying at Nicola's amazing apartment we were able to take our kids (ages 10 & 12) all the great museums and sights in Dublin - they especially loved St. Stephen's Green, the Book of Kells,  The Epic Museum and seeing the bog preserved bodies at the National Museum! What an amazing location Exchequer Street is, everything is within walking distance and having a huge Dunnes Stores food hall right next door is a real bonus. Nicola has done an amazing job leaving suggested restaurants and things to do in the area. Overall an A+ Airbnb experience!"
6494825,439187270,4/18/2019,"This is such a beautiful space, convenient and within walking distances to nearly everything in Dublin.  Nicola is an amazing host-fantastic communication and super easy instructions for everything!  Highly recommend this place-worked perfectly for my familys visit to Dublin!"
6494825,440171321,4/20/2019,"Absolutely gorgeous apartment, the photos really dont do it justice. Tastefully decorated, bright and spacious and incredible location. Highly recommend staying here for your Dublin trip!"
6494825,443663015,4/26/2019,Great place in a great location.  Met all my expectations wish I had more than one night in Dublin and the apartment but I know Ill be back.

6494825,445963508,4/30/2019,Nicole's apartemnt is excellence on both place and apartment facilities. Good place and complete instruction on the local travelling and life. It is great recommended to stay there.
6494825,446818365,5/2/2019,A great apartment in a great location. Very stylish and full of everyhting needed to have an enjoyable stay. The proximity to the heart of the all the action was a big benefit. Disappointed we could only stay the two nights.
6494825,449213645,5/6/2019,Huge flat in a terrific central location. Very stylish and clean with a very easy check in/out process. Easy access to & from the airport using the Airlink 747 bus at College Green stop. This is a very lively neighbourhood with good nightlife steps away - this means that the common areas can get noisy in the evenings but we enjoyed this atmosphere and the bedroom itself was soundproofed and very quiet. This was my second stay here and I highly recommend it! Nicola is an excellent host.
6494825,450836016,5/10/2019,Perfect location. Beautiful apartment.
6494825,451823260,5/12/2019,"The place is right in the heart of the city, really convenient. The flat is gigantic and clean. Nicola made sure that we have everything we could possible need for our stay!"
6494825,452960370,5/14/2019,"Centrally located, very spacious with a unique layout, clean apartment with fully equipped kitchen. Nice street views, but no real noise.  It's a short walk away from many places to eat, grocery stores and local attractions. Add some 20 euro per night for parking though if arriving by car (note that nearby parking is not overnight)."
6494825,453561627,5/16/2019,"Nicolas place was amazing!  Such a great apartment in an amazing location. Nicola is a fantastic host and the place has lots of great features. We only wish we had been able to spend more time in Dublin.  
I know there have been some comments about sound issues but that wasnt a problem in the least. We would stay here again in a second"
6494825,454477294,5/18/2019,"The location cant be beat and Nicola provided extraordinary local tips. The back bedroom was quiet, even on the weekend, and the apartment has tremendous historical charm. Will return."
6494825,456711756,5/22/2019,"Nicola was a gracious host, and he was helpful and timely with his responses. The bunks and the queen bed are all in one room, and there is one bathroom.  The unit is more dated than others we used, but it was located in an area of Dublin that was near the things we wanted to do."
6494825,457448119,5/24/2019,"Beautiful, stylish apartment in a prime Dublin location. The perfect place for anyone looking to take in the sights and sounds of Dublin."
6494825,461221732,5/31/2019,Nicolas place was just as it was described. We were very pleased with our accommodation and appreciated her recommendations. Beds were very comfortable.
6494825,463524647,6/3/2019,"First of all, amazing flat! Its super spacious and greatly laid out. Nicola made it super easy to know where everything was and the experience has been great, from keys pick up to check out. Great location and well worth the money."
6494825,472709433,6/20/2019,"Place was great and is even better than the pictures. It is a really nice set-up for a family. My children loved the bunk beds. Our only complaint is that the WiFi was poor. For myself, not a big deal, but a real problem for the children when we would come back to the flat in the evenings.  Other than that, a perfect place and the location could not be any better. Exchequer is a fun street with a ton going on and a grocery store right downstairs."
6494825,474751618,6/23/2019,"In a word...superb! From the point of booking to the point of us leaving, the communication, instructions, local knowledge, facilities, cleanliness and location were just amazing.

The apartment had a really homely feel to it, was decorated beautifully and had everything we needed to make our trip to Dublin that much more special.

You are located centrally and pretty much everything you could need to get to is within a 5-10 minute walk, or even closer if you used some of the bikes for hire right outside the front of the apartment.

If you are thinking of a city-centre apartment then you simply cannot go wrong with this one - Nicola was great and communication was very quick and easy.

We simply cannot wait to return to Dublin and wouldn't hesitate in booking this apartment again...10/10!"
6494825,477435094,6/28/2019,"This apartment is spacious and features a nice layout. There was plenty of room for our family of four. The kitchen is large and well-stocked. In a time when Airbnbs are increasingly quasi-hotel rooms, this apartment has a charming lived-in feel and a sense of history to it. The location is as central as it gets in Dublin, allowing one to explore on foot in this wonderfully walkable city."
6494825,478954372,6/30/2019,This apartment is right in the middle of the action. A fantastic apartment with huge space and a great view over a lively street. It is noisy at night but the bedroom is really quiet with comfortable beds. Loved staying here and how close it is to everything.
6494825,480776233,7/3/2019,"Great location, close to everything! The tips from Nicola were so helpful!"
6494825,483039072,7/7/2019,"This apartment is a delight - modern, spacious, comfortable, well-appointed, and ideally located in the city centre. Nicola has left tons of notes, tips, and helpful hints that made everything a breeze. Our family of five spent a comfortable night in every single bed there was. Streets were a touch noisy on a Saturday night, but nothing the thick curtains and a white noise app couldnt drown out. Kitchen is stocked and easy too - we grabbed food from the fancy market across the street and prepared it without a hitch. If youre looking to stay in Dublin you could not find a better host or location than this gem!"
6494825,486179824,7/12/2019,"Excellent location, amazing food and very good response to questions.  Nearby parking is a plus."
6494825,489186880,7/16/2019,Great apartment right in the Heart of the action in Dublin but still extremely quiet. We had two children 4 and 6 and the bunks were great. Nicola is a thoughtful host and has detailed instructions throughout the apartment.
6494825,490257789,7/18/2019,"Nicolas place is perfectly placed to have easy access to Dublins bustling center. There were so many restaurants, pubs, and shops within walking distance. The apartment was exactly as advertised. Spacious and warm. Cant wait to return!"
6494825,491565483,7/20/2019,"Nicolas Airbnb is in the best area of Dublin! We walked across the street and had the best dinner and went around the corner for a drink in the pub. Its everything you want, right at your front door. She had the best tips for Dublin and a sparkling clean and inviting apartment. We hope to be back again one day!"
6494825,492499392,7/21/2019,"Nicolas place was beautiful, spacious, super clean and in a GREAT location. She had thoughtful touches and instructions throughout the space. It was also super easy to check in and out. We would highly recommend this space."
6494825,497022946,7/28/2019,"What an amazing spot in the most central Dublin location! The apartment is beautifully decorated...the art and unique decor make for a very special place to stay. Everything we wanted to see and do was quick walk away. Great home away from home when visiting Dublin! Only thing we missed was a French press pot or coffee maker, other than that apartment is very well equipped with any item you might need. Thanks for a great stay!"
6494825,498862526,7/30/2019,"Nicola's place is lovely!  It is situated extremely well.  Close to Temple Bar, but not on the most busy bar-lined street so that it was perfect for our family including our daughter and her grandparents. There are many great shops and restaurants close by, including delicious ice cream. We felt like we were in the center of everything, but the apartment was still calm.  It is a very short walk to Trinity College.  There are a couple flights of stairs to go up, but my elderly in-laws managed them with no problem.  The furniture in the apartment is very tasteful and it is beautifully designed overall, with a great kitchen and bath with plenty of towels and a fantastic shower and tub.  The beds were very comfortable and the bedroom was extremely quiet.  We slept 5 people very comfortably on the main bed, two bunk beds, and the sofa bed.  Nicola provided a lot of helpful signs so we could figure out how to lock the doors, turn on the hot water, etc.  She also had a bunch of tips for restaurants and other things to see around Dublin.  The place is very kid-friendly--there are toys and scooters and my 9-year-old loved the bunk bed in particular.  We had a great stay and would love to come back."
6494825,499238921,7/31/2019,Everything perfect.
6494825,500627068,8/2/2019,The location is amazing. Close to tons of bars and restaurants and the hustle and bustle. Apartment was clean and Nicola was very helpful.
6494825,501340488,8/3/2019,"This apartment was miles better than we could have anticipated. The whole place was clean and comfortable and in a brilliant location.

Nicola went above and beyond with helpful notes throughout the apartment and a lovely little guide to the area.

I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking to be in central Dublin."
6494825,503640723,8/6/2019,Nicolas place was perfect. Everything on her listing was exactly as described and the location was better then imagined. We cant wait to visit Dublin again and would stay here for sure.
6494825,504788619,8/8/2019,Really amazing apartment in a perfect location. Highly recommended. So much better than any of the hotel options that I looked into. I was traveling with my 2 kids and it was perfect for them. Best Airbnb that Ive stayed in by far.
6494825,512180377,8/18/2019,The apartment is great.  Its perfectly located for a great exploration of Dublin.  The owner is very thoughtful and there are a ton of wonderful touches that made the apartment feel like home.  I highly recommend this lovely place.
6494825,513382217,8/19/2019,We experienced an almost magical holiday at Nicola's home. The scenery and surrounding majestic Atlantic was breathtaking. Not a view anyone could ever get used to or take for granted.   Colleen
6494825,517322120,8/25/2019,Nicolas place was in a great location. You definitely have to be able to walk up the four flights to enter. It was clean and ample space for our party of four.  It is a noisy location but bedroom is fairly quiet.
6494825,519254238,8/28/2019,"Pros:
1. Excellent location in the heart of the old city. 
2. Responsive nice host.
3. Minimal noise in bedroom.
4. Toys for kids.
5. Great grocery store across the street.
6. Bunk beds in master.

Cons:
1. Not very clean. It was surface level cleaned but inside drawers, walls, washer, beds, etc it was  dirty and unkept. Beware of you open drawers.
2. Flies get in whenever open windows. It needs window screens. It was impossible to get ventilation without flies getting in. 
3. Master also has zero ventilation outside a door that leads to fire stairs and loud vents which limits the poss of opening at night.
4.. Limited hot water in shower. It was only warm enough for 5 minutes or so shower then gets cold and you will have to wait another 20-30 minutes  for it to heat up again. Remember to turn on the switch ahead of time. 
5. Large cell phone tower across the way a street or two away which was a big safety concern for us. This of course is of no fault of the owner. There is plenty of research that proves negative health impacts of distance to cell towers. Would have not rented it if wr had known ahead of time. I would be most concerned for children who ate most suceptible and adults who have health issues. 
6. Building needs to be kept up. There were dirty towels left outside the main door. While it's an old building with charm it felt very seedy and we questioned whether we made a mistake from the moment we arrived.

All in all the unit has tremendous potential to be lovely unit if it is kept up, deep cleaned after all guests and better organized."
6494825,519737120,8/29/2019,"This is such a wonderful spot - fantastic central  location, lovely & clean. Comms & info about  Dublin was spot on - that made navigating Dublin a breeze.

We had a wonderful sleep & wasnt disturbed by any noise from below. 

Thank you Nicola/Fergal for a fabulous stay. 

Will definitely stay again."
6494825,521099602,8/31/2019,Great stylish place. A really nice location near Temple Bar. Keys were easy to pick up and drop off. A great space for our family of four.
6494825,521932912,9/1/2019,Fantastic space!
6494825,526037094,9/8/2019,Cracking spot - right in the heart of everything! You couldn't wish for a better location. Happily it was still quiet at night time and we always felt secure perched up high in the apartment.
6494825,527569234,9/11/2019,"This apartment is spacious and clean, and we found it to be perfectly located to what we wanted to do while in Dublin for just 3 days. The building itself is gorgeous from the outside and very historical and old. The immediate surrounding area has anything you could need. We walked everywhere we wanted to go and became familiar with the nearby establishments pretty quickly :)
There was no noise heard from the bedroom and any noise we heard from the kitchen area didnt bother us one bit. The location actually feels pretty quiet and safe. Would stay here again and hope we get the chance to!"
6494825,529112376,9/14/2019,Great location for a stay in Dublin.  No rental car needed at all.  Walking distance to all the main attractions along with a grocery store right next door.  The apartment is clean and tidy.  You will not be disappointed with your stay here.
6518542,438681728,4/17/2019,Adam was really helpfull and reactive when needed. It was really cool sharing the flat with him 
6518542,455116380,5/19/2019,"Adam was super responsive and easy to get along with. Check-in was simple, and we had access to everything we needed."
6518542,471820571,6/18/2019,"Adam has been a great host, it was a pleasure sharing the flat with him and have a  chat from time to time. The position is very close to the city center, but the bedroom is quite small, suitable for a single person."
6518542,482294522,7/6/2019,"Pictures are not accurate- lot of stuff in shared space, no lock on bedroom door, both bedroom & bathroom were very dirty (i.e. found a womans hair accessory in the bed that was not mine, lot of mold in bathroom- beware of allergies). However, Adam was very nice & accommodating with check-in & communication."
6518542,510718969,8/16/2019,"I would not recommend  stay in this place at all
1)	Bed and smelly mattress and bedset. I have been stayed in many Airbnb for last 3 years, I never had any problem with any of the place, but this place the bed set, matters is so old and smell horrible, I have to spent 80 Euro to buy a whole brand new bed set , so I can sleep. The mattress is supper old and smelly too. Everyday morning I have to leave the window open so I can stay  at night in the room .  

2)	Bad host behavior.  I was not be allowed to do laundry until after 11:00pm because Adam need to watch TV in the living room, he said it is very noise, but the water laundry is such a small one, the noise is not bad all, he just do not want to sacrifice even a little for his guest at all. The worst thing is that , he put his short in my laundry, next day in the morning I saw a man short in my laundry, I was pissed off and ask him why he did that , he denied what he did, so the short has leg and walked into the laundry itself?

3)	Unflushed toilet. Yes!!!!! Can you imaged that when you used the toilet in the morning, there some unflushed poop in the toilet and you saw it? That is f** so disgusting, it happened couple times, even tho on the day the day I checked out the place,  I saw it again, basically I lost my whole appetite  the whole day by seeing that, trust it , if you stay there ,you need to prepare for unflushed poop and the image will just hang in your mind all the time.  

4)	Horrible shower. It is impossible to take a good shower in this apt,  I have to go to gym everyday only for shower, feel free to stay here if you never shower 

5)	 the apartment is very old, which is fun, I paid $2000 for one month, I felt I definitely overpaid for a place like that for sure

6)	Lies. I asked Adam, how many people stay in the places, he said only himself, but turns out his girlfriend came to stay over all the time. Sometimes I have to wait for them to stop use the restroom so I can use the restroom, if I know there are 2 ppl stay there and I have to share the restroom with 2 other person I will never stay there. 

7)	Dirty Kitchen, if you want to use the kitchen to wash an apple, forget it, there are always dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and supper smelly with flies. 

8)	Noise from street, it is very close to the road, the noise is not too bad at night, but it will become really bad start early morning. I got woke up early in the morning by the car noise from the street, so I have to have a Nosie proof headset on, so I will not be woke up in the morning, which is very uncomfortable. 

All my Airbnb stay in last 3 years are all positive, this is my first time to give a negative review, because I have to speak out my mind this time , because it is such bizarre experience"
6518542,523475006,9/3/2019,"Adam was attentive with me every time, and easy-going, from checking to check out.  He made easy for me to stay in, great host.  
It is somewhat expensive, but like the rest of the prices in Dublin near Merrion Sq. 
Apartment has old furniture and stuff, but it is just as shown in the pictures, without  surprise or cheating. 
Although his things are around the house, he always tells you that you can use everything as you want or need.  In short, good value for money in my opinion."
6518542,525888904,9/8/2019,Thank you so much Adam for letting me stay with such short notice! Very much appreciated. I was canceled on 3x and this price was by far much better for someone just looking for a bed for two days. Very friendly and quiet place.
6518542,528550878,9/13/2019,Wonderful cozy place in the centre of town and a great host.
6519794,425514367,3/18/2019,We really enjoyed our stay at Bernadines place for St. Patricks day!! Great room in a good location with just a short bus ride to the city center. We recommend and would come again.
6519794,434730358,4/8/2019,"Bernadine and Brendan were amazing!  This was my first time using Airbnb and they probably ruined it for my future stays with other people.  I didn't really know what to expect, but they did everything they could to provide the absolute  best accommodations and hospitality possible.  Bernadine was quick to respond to any of my questions before I arrived in Dublin and when I arrived at their residence her and Brendan helped me with anything I needed.  My flight arrived later than expected and she was flexible with my check-in.  They both asked me about my plans, which I was flexible with, and they made recommendations and checked the weather for me in order to make the best decision.  They are a little bit outside of Dublin, but are in a great location with many amenities such as Aldi and the local pub/restaurant within walking distance.  The bus stop is also a short walk and only takes about 10 minutes to get into Dublin.  I could have not asked for better hospitality.  I would definitely recommend a stay here and would come back in a heartbeat if I come back to the Dublin area."
6519794,446865869,5/2/2019,"Lovely house, home from home in West Dublin. Just down the road from supermarket and pub. Sparklingly clean, en-suite and quiet. Would recommend and stay again."
6519794,449215943,5/6/2019,Had a great stay at Bernadine's place in Palmerstown. Nice room and easy acces to the Dublin city centre by bus. Would definitely recommend!
6519794,452897906,5/14/2019,"Bernadine was very courteous during our stay. She was also very helpful and quick when we need to go somewhere or find a great place in Dublin. The house is located close to the center of Dublin, in a calm neighborhood with a great garden a few minutes walking distance. Hope to come back soon."
6519794,459268908,5/27/2019,all great :) wonderful people and place
6519794,463382226,6/3/2019,Bernadine is the perfect balance between being informative/helpful and nonintrusive.  Answered any questions I had and made helpful suggestions ahead of our visit.  Her place was perfectly described on the B&B site.  If we go back this is where we'll  stay!
6519794,467869059,6/11/2019,"The place was very easy to find and there's plenty of street parking in the area. The bus stop was also only a 3-4 minute walk away and 20 minutes away from the city. The room was smaller than expected but nonetheless very cozy and had a lot of extra amenities such as a power adaptor and mini tv. The bed is a bit worn out as you could feel all the springs when you lay down. In the morning, there is a fairly large selection of cereal and toast for breakfast. Bernadine was also very kind to lend us a leap card to use."
6519794,481720089,7/5/2019,"I would throughly recommend this place, the host is so friendly and welcoming. Her house is very clean and comfortable. And ideally located."
6519794,484673808,7/9/2019,Lovely home with hospitable and accommodating hosts! Highly recommended!
6519794,486337595,7/12/2019,It will be impressiveness experience in your traveling in Ireland
6525773,510530421,8/16/2019,"Great location, friendly host"
6525773,514045663,8/20/2019,Great location!
6550308,423471801,3/14/2019,A lovely stay in Maud's flat in Dublin. Easy to walk to the City centre (15 min approx.) or to take a bus.
6550308,428914143,3/26/2019,Mauds place is awesome! We walked everywhere! There was just enough space for the two of us and she gave awesome recommendations!
6550308,429939154,3/29/2019,"A beautiful space aesthetically, however the entire place smelled as though it had been recently painted causing my mother and I to have trouble breathing and brought about headaches after prolonged time spent in the home."
6550308,431561571,4/1/2019,"Great spot, great host!"
6550308,432909698,4/5/2019,"We stayed at Mauds place for 3 nights and had an amazing time. Great location where we were able to walk everywhere despite the rainy weather. Maud provided a small book which had recommendations of places to eat, drink etc. We tried Las Tapas de Lola which was recommended in the book and it was delicious!"
6550308,435438734,4/10/2019,"Such a great location in the city. Everything was 25min walk or less with the Guinness factory only about 15min away. The guest house was perfect size for two and the full kitchen with all the amenities was very useful. Maud was great, gave us lots of amazing suggestions when we got there and answered any questions we had along the way."
6550308,439169999,4/18/2019,"A cosy place, close to the city. Maud gave us lots of helpful recommendations on where to go and the sauna was a real bonus!"
6550308,450739171,5/10/2019,Maud's place is in a great location within walking distance of many of Dublin's attractions. The apartment was stylish and the sauna was a nice touch. Lots of great information available on local sites and restaurants.
6550308,455836929,5/20/2019,Maud's place is exactly as advertised. It is a beautiful spot filled with homey touches that go a long way. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!
6550308,457157451,5/23/2019,"My partner and I booked this place due to is location in relation to the Guinness storehouse and we were not disappointed as it was only a 5/10 minute walk away!

The studio was quirky and nice to stay in, was very clean which we appreciated!

The walk to the city centre takes about 20/30 minutes. 

Our taxi driver from the airport struggled to find the place but we got there eventually! However he suggested that we taxi back at night as he said it was not the safest of areas for tourists at night? Which left us slightly worried but it ended up being totally fine!

One thing I would say is that I feel the studio needs more locks. We were assured that the doors locked themselves but for safety cautious people like us, this had as feeling concerned and we would have preferred to have physical locks on both doors (e.g. garden & street entrance).

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again! Thank you so much for your hospitality."
6550308,458515087,5/26/2019,Very nice place
6550308,460534517,5/29/2019,Had a brilliant stay in the Jungalow. Its cosy and quirky and a short walk from the city centre. Would 100% stay again
6550308,462751360,6/2/2019,"We had a very good stay at Mauds place. It's a comfortable studio and the sauna is lovely! The mattress was a bit old, you could feel the springs but we got used to that"
6550308,465238130,6/7/2019,Nice small place about 20 min walk outside the city. Comfortable for two people.
6550308,468717832,6/13/2019,Mauds place is very swanky and I love it! Highly recommend for lone travelers l!
6550308,472276316,6/19/2019,"Maud was an amazing host who is very welcoming. The studio was perfect for our needs, its very comfortable cozy and clean. I strongly recommend this place if visiting Dublin; only a 6 min bus ride right into the city centre and has everything you need! Thanks again Maud!"
6550308,474629799,6/23/2019,"Maud left tips (where to go, what to do) and they were perfect...we managed to fit in a trip to Howth, no Seals but still enjoyed. Go hungry if you like fish. 

We ate at Temple Bar - smokehouse - I had food poisoning the next day so we didn't leave the place much and the Amazon Fire stick made all the difference. 

There is an Lidl close by and a pharmacy. 
Alot of the tips of moving around were to catch busses etc. We walked everywhere and the walk was about 15mins in to temple bar and the same to William's st. Which has good nightlife. 

We definitely enjoyed our trip to Dublin and  Maud's place was a good spot to rest your head."
6550308,481153535,7/4/2019,"We had a great time at Maud's place, and would happily go back there! It has a good location, being so close to a Lidl and on the 150 bus route, and it was nice having our own entrance. The space was clean and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook several meals. Any issues we had, both before and during our stay, were quickly deal with and Maud and her whole family were always happy to help when we had questions about how to work the Amazon Fire TV stick and turn on the oven for example."
6550308,484196222,7/8/2019,"We were staying for 4 nights and really liked the place! We felt like home. Sauna was a nice add to the comfort! Own entrance to the street was great. Buss to the centre just around the corner! Bus stop less than one minute away.... to the city centre in 10 minutes by bus. Airport accessible by bus no 16 with 3,30‚Ç¨ or leap card. Own cooking facilities was a big plus to make our own breakfast every morning. Shops quite close for daily needs for groceries. Wifi worked well. Very friendly hosts and a lot of good tips how to move in the city, and where to go and eat as well. Teeling whisky distillery in walking distance was nice place to visit, that was a good tip as well. If in Dublin again, we will stay here again! Thanks for all the nice chats as well! Highly recommend this one!"
6550308,486183441,7/12/2019,Cosy and unique place to stay and we slept very comfortably here!  Met the host to check-in but we had our own backdoor so that was great. Slightly far to walk to town but we got used to it! We really enjoyed the nearby Guinness Factory!
6550308,493247349,7/22/2019,A must-stay apartment. Great for couples/friends wanting a city break. 20 minutes from the centre. Beautifully designed; loved all the natural light! Super comfy bed! Perfect for relaxing after a busy day.
6550308,497227870,7/28/2019,Maud is a great host! Thanks for everything and I hope to be back in Ireland again soon!
6550308,507953090,8/12/2019,"We enjoyed a week in the jungalow. It was centrally located for us, as we are big walkers. 20 min walks into town were easy and enjoyable. The private entrance is a rare treat in a city setting, so it was great to come and go freely. Maud is helpful and accommodating. We would stay again."
6550308,511264818,8/17/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay in Dublin at de Airbnb. But the kitchen wasnt as clean as expected and the mattress was a bit uncomfortable, because we could feel every single spring... We didnt use the Sauna but it looked quite nice. The Busstop is just around the corner, which is a big plus."
6550308,518811892,8/27/2019,"Fijne plek met alles wat je nodig hebt aanwezig. 20 min lopen naar het  centrum, maar ook leuke pubs en restaurantjes in de buurt."
6550308,524519268,9/6/2019,Very nice host with a very nice place !
6550308,526788607,9/9/2019,A really quiet nice place close to the city center.
6550308,532669324,9/20/2019,"We really enjoyed our stay in Mauds studio. All the essentials needed were there, and it was only a short walk from the city centre and grocery store. The studio was clean and cosy. Maud left us with many suggestions on where to eat and go which was nice. The sauna is a nice addition after a day of exploring. I would recommend this Airbnb."
6550308,535334830,9/24/2019,"We had an amazing stay in Dublin at Mauds place. The air bnb is situated within walking distance of the Guinness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery, Temple bar and several other popular tourist destinations. She was very helpful and quick to respond to any of our questions. She had some amazing restaurant recommendations. The place was clean and welcoming. Overall it was a lovely experience! Highly recommend."
6550308,537192241,9/28/2019,"Good location! Maud left a book of recommendations that were lovely. There is only one blanket in the place (the comforter on the bed) and its a kinda itchy blanket. Bed is not very soft.

We still enjoyed our time. The place was small, quiet, and cute. Its equipped with anything you might need to cook."
6550308,539868160,10/2/2019,Good place to stay close walking to major tourist things. Sauna was nice after walking around all day.
6550308,541539143,10/5/2019,"Beautiful Airbnb in Dublin City. Next time, we will stay there too :)"
6550308,543742824,10/8/2019,Cool Airbnb spot
6550308,546164783,10/13/2019,"We had so much fun staying at Maud's, were able to walk everywhere in Dublin and enjoyed the hot sauna afterward. Hope to stay again in the future."
6550308,556764794,10/30/2019,"Mauds cozy guesthouse is lovely, quiet place to stay in a bustling city. It was the perfect location to explore Dublin from and were able to easily walk everywhere we wanted to go. She gave us wonderful recommendations for things to do and places to eat as well. Absolutely take the DART from Bray and take the cliff walk to Greystones!  We highly recommend Maud and her guesthouse to anyone visiting Dublin!"
6550308,558867785,11/3/2019,We spend 4 peaceful days in Maud's appartement in Dublin. The equipements and hospitality of Maud were great ! Thank you for everything.
6550308,560280790,11/6/2019,"My boyfriend and I had a great time staying here. This location is a bit of a walk from downtown but we never found this to be a problem. You can either take a ~25 minute walk or the bus station is super convenient and right around the corner. 

The place was clean and had a nice homey feeling to it. The sauna was a nice touch and we liked having the grocery store up the block so we could make our own breakfasts. The neighbourhood felt very safe even at night. Would recommend to a friend and personally come back!"
6566265,434674356,4/8/2019,"Casa pulitissima e confortevole, proprietaria estremamente ospitale e sempre veloce nelle comunicazioni per messaggio,  ottima collocazione in una bella zona residenziale vicina ad ampi spazi verdi e al mare e ben collegata al centro dal treno urbano DART (ca. 15 minuti di percorrenza). Ho apprezzato molto la presenza in camera di una scrivania per lavorare."
6566265,450843445,5/10/2019,Loved my stay
6580137,418074177,3/1/2019,A great home in a very central location. Bob is an excellent host who has taken care to make sure his guests want for nothing during their stay. A real home from home
6580137,426178793,3/20/2019,"I cannot recommend Bob's place enough. The location is central and walkable, the house itself is very comfortable and has funky decorations, and Bob is a wonderful host. If you stay here, you'll be staying in a three-bedroom house, of which all three bedrooms are let out on Airbnb (Bob lives nearby, but not in this house). I met two other really great solo travellers while staying here. I had everything I needed, and Bob was super accommodating when it came to check-in/check-out times. If you're going to Dublin, do yourself a favour and stay here!"
6580137,431972467,4/2/2019,"Everything you need to have a lovely jumping-off point for Dublin. Bob is so kind. Super quiet area with 3 convenience stores just across the street. Full kitchen with all the basics in case you cook. Every major tourist attraction is a 20 minute walk or less, and I felt safe walking alone at night here too. 
Dont miss: 
-The Fumbally for breakfast or lunch (their egg dish was my favorite thing I ate in the whole country) (3 min walk)
-Cathedral Cafe for nice lunch or breakfast (2 min walk)
-Jam Art Factory (local artists work for sale, gifts, 4 minute walk)
-Queen of Tarts for scones (10 min walk)"
6580137,435369344,4/10/2019,Bob's place was fantastic! Even better than described. Bob was incredibly hospitable and helpful in directing us during our first days in Ireland. We certainly wish we could have stayed longer. Would highly recomend.
6580137,439074976,4/18/2019,"Bob's apartment is situated within a 10 min. walking distance to the center of Dublin. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and he offers many amenities in the kitchen. Bob responds quickly and even though I arrived at the airport very late, he graciously stayed up and waited for me to let me in and show me around the apartment and have a chat. Thank you, Bob!"
6580137,440056936,4/20/2019,"Cozy and homely space that was surprisingly quiet given its proximity to the centre. Easy walk to any and all needed amenities as well as must-see landmarks. Room was tidy, comfy and came with all we needed. Highly recommend!"
6580137,441648418,4/22/2019,"Bob is an excellent host, he gave us precise directions to get to his place,  welcomed us with tea and coffee and gave us a lot of good advices about food and everything .

Thank Bob,  that was cool."

6580137,446372358,5/1/2019,"The only problem with Bob's place is that none of the photographs show what you really are getting: an incredibly thoughtful and helpful host, a space decorated and appointed very well and a location that can't be beat. We booked after another host cancelled and expected a basic, clean spot. Bob blew those simple expectations out of the water. This has been my best AirBnB experience, and I have had quite a lot. Don't hesitate to stay here!"
6580137,448602095,5/5/2019,Bobs place is located in a great location for exploring Dublin by foot. Bob was kind in spending time showing us a map of Dublin and pointing out areas and sites to explore. He also referred us to a variety of places to eat which made planning our days easier. We would like to return since there is so much more we would like to see.
6580137,460448857,5/29/2019,We had a nice two night stay at Bobs place. Easy to get to from the airlink bus and walk everywhere. The bed was very comfy and space was friendly to come back to. It would be ideal for a group renting the whole place especially.

The location is nice located, close to everything but in a quieter location. He is very responsive and helped us with all of our needs and questions.

I recommend this place for anyone looking for a shared place."

6580137,527702305,9/11/2019,Bobs  place was very comfortable and he is a great host willing to share his wealth of knowledge about Dublin. This is a great location if you plan to take any of the Hop On Hop Off tours as there is a stop only a block away. Also convenient to the Airlink bus to and from the airport as that is only several blocks away. Overall a great experience for my first time using Airbnb.
6580137,531765688,9/18/2019,"We had a wonderful stay at Bobs home - he was such a kind, friendly, and helpful host!

6580137,533241720,9/21/2019,"Bob's place felt just like home. My room was spacious and comfortable and I slept really well. The other renters were kind and lovely too! The bathroom takes some getting used to but it's fine once you get the hang of it. The location is really good, it's basically 10 mins walk to everything you need, but at least you're not in the middle of the crazy crowds. Bob's place was so cozy and homey, it made me want to stay longer in Dublin!"
6580137,535347159,9/24/2019,A lovely place to stay in Dublin. The place had everything we needed - the umbrella especially!

It is always nice to meet nice and kind people when you travel and just that was the case."
6580137,543225621,10/7/2019,"Bob gave us a very warm welcome with a cup of tea (we were woken through by the rain). He gave us very helpful recommendations regarding pubs and music locations. The room is big enough for two people and very cosy with an antique but comfortable bed. You have to share the bathroom with the other guest, which is no problem. It is really perfect that you can use the kitchen with coffee machine, tea, spices, cutlery etc. We enjoyed a very relaxed breakfast (milk and cereals were priced by Bob!). The room is located in a quiet col-du-sac Road. It is a 15 Minutes walk to temple bar. I can definitely recommend it!"
6580137,544526722,10/10/2019,"I had such a wonderful stay at Bobs place in Dublin! The house is in a great location, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. Great communication from the host and he met me upon arrival to give me a tour of the house and review the local map over a pot of tea. The house is within a short walk to all the local attractions plus plenty of restaurants. I was able to get around easily on foot. Bob had many great suggestions for restaurants, bars and shops. I loved all the little extras in the kitchen and the beautiful garden view. It was everything I could have wanted in an Airbnb experience and I will definitely stay at Bobs again the next time I visit Dublin! Safe house and neighborhood for my solo trip!"

6602165,532219035,9/19/2019,"Robbie is a great host. He is a great wealth of information and a phenomenal person altogether. He also went above and beyond when the adapter I brought from the States didn't work, he had one to loan us."

6609028,420631746,3/7/2019,"This is a gem! Your close to the city, but feel like your in the country side. We woke up every morning to the sounds of birds chirping and stunning garden views. Teresa is there to answer any question you might have in a timely manner. This is where you should stay if you want to explore Ireland!"
6609028,428503615,3/25/2019,"We absolutely adored our stay here. This place is a hidden gem. Wish we had more time to enjoy it! Quiet, safe, clean, and quaint. Well kept, beautiful garden. So glad we decided to stay outside the city."
6609028,430832684,3/31/2019,Our stay was really nice. The cottage is perfectly equipped and clean. The location is great and the residence with the big garden is really calm. Teresa gave us a lot of splendid advices and she is very reactive. We would definitely come back there :)
6609028,434734431,4/8/2019,"Teresas place is amazingly beautiful.; surrounded by a stunning very green nicely manicured garden, The little cabin was a very relaxing place where to spent our time in Ireland.  Teresa was very kind and welcoming when we first arrived. The cabin has everything you need for your stay there. The cabin is very clean. I am very happy I stayed outside the city because when we would go into the city center, it was really busy (too busy for me) and its not even peak tourist time. The area that this place is located at is VERY nice area and there is a grade school only a couple of minutes away. I noticed this when we left her property to find breakfast and at about 9AM, we see their kids on bikes and being dropped off by their parents to the school. The only bad thing I have to say is that, I had to leave her place and had to leave Ireland and make my way back to the states.

Her place made me love Ireland more than ever, and this place will be my go to place when Im back in Ireland and I hope its soon!

Thanks Teresa!"
6609028,443621389,4/26/2019,"I found this gorgeous cottage to be the ideal home base for 8 days of exploring Dublin and beyond. Beautiful, comfortable, private and quiet. Kitchen has all one needs to prepare simple meals which saved me quite a bit of money. Taking public transportation felt simple and safe for a solo female traveler, even late at night. Awesome neighborhood. Blackrock also has a pretty park and good eateries."
6609028,449742528,5/7/2019,"My husband and I stayed at Teresa's cabin for several days in early May while visiting Dublin. The cabin is very close to bus stops into central Dublin and for the airport express bus. It's also close to a shopping center with an Aldi's for your grocery needs. It's in a very quiet and private area, and provided a lovely respite after sightseeing all day in Dublin. The weather was chilly when we visited, and it was cozy and warm inside the cabin, despite the large windows (which have privacy curtains). We had access to a washing machine during our stay, which came in handy. Would definitely stay again!"
6609028,461386911,5/31/2019,"This small cabin was perfect, if you are alone or with a significant other I highly recommend staying here! Not a far trip to Dublin center. You have the perfect privacy, convenient shopping centers within walking distance. Great view in the morning for a nice breakfast or coffee. Teresa is a GREAT host and replys almost instantaneously when you have a question or need something! For me this stay was easily a 10/10."
6609028,464704534,6/6/2019,"Teresa is a wonderful host! She was very hospitable and allowed us an earlier check in time which was a huge relief for us. The cottage itself is beautiful and has an amazing view of the garden which was so lovely to wake up to. It is also in a great location being only a few minutes away from bus stops, a train station and the Blackrock market. I would highly recommend staying here."
6609028,469288852,6/14/2019,"We loved it here, its a perfect little oasis that feels like youre in the countryside surrounded by the beautiful gardens, but close to Dublin via public transport, thats super easy to walk to, and all off the cute little cafes and pubs in Blackrock, as well as the shopping centre."
6609028,473828103,6/22/2019,"The cottage at Clonlea Studios is a quiet, charming haven in the middle of a bustling Dublin suburb. It is clean and comfortable, and a perfect base from which to explore Dublin, Wicklow, and Meath, all of which are just a short drive away. Also located a short walk from Blackrock center, which offers a variety of shops, restaurants, and the wonderful Blackrock Market, as well as easy access to public transportation. 

The kitchen is not equipped for any serious cooking, either in terms of size or equipment, so expect to be limited on that front. With so many excellent restaurant choices in the area, however, we didnt find this to be a significant problem. Easy access to laundry facilities was a huge plus, as was the lovely view of the garden from the cottages generous windows.

Teresa was an excellent host! She made us feel welcome as soon as we arrived, and responded to any questions quickly and thoroughly. Our entire stay was a great experience, and I highly recommend this property to other travelers!"
6609028,481794231,7/5/2019,"Lovely cabin with nice garden, good connections everywhere, suitable for couples :)"
6609028,485656148,7/11/2019,"This little cabin is the perfect place to stay if you want to visit Dublin but want a little more quiet than you would get in the city, or if you want to explore more of beautiful eastern Ireland. I was able to get to Howth, Bray, and Dublin in well under an hour via train. I was able to cook to help save some expenses, plus this place feels isolated and peaceful while still being easily accessible. I highly recommend!!"
6609028,495728790,7/26/2019,"A gorgeous little cabin, thoughtfully appointed, set in an amazingly beautiful garden.   Convenient to everything we needed to do. Really thank you so much"

The host, Teresa is quick to reply with any queries you may have and very friendly.

6609028,529917707,9/15/2019,"If your looking for great value and privacy with easy transport into town or down the coast this is the one to go for. The gardens are beautiful to sit out in and your not overlooked, the place feels like a prefect little hide away and the host is attentive and lovely to deal with, can't fault it."
6609028,534925844,9/23/2019,A beautiful compact haven in a garden of tranquility.

I loved waking up seeing the garden full of birds and squirrels! 
The position is quite good too, in thirty minutes with the bus you are in the center of Dublin. 
Teresa is super sweet and she answers rapidly.
I highly recommend this place if you want to discover more about Ireland!"

6630854,519248467,8/28/2019,Great house with a big garden - We stayed here as 4 couples and there was more than enough room for the 8 of us. The house is a short drive into Dun Laoghaire and a 15/20 min walk to the tram into Dublin. Brian was great and gave us suggestions for live music on the Sunday. Would definitely recommend staying here!

6636633,442716220,4/24/2019,"Imelda's home is spotless, cozy and comfortable.   She's a wonderful host who will make you feel completely at home, and she provides many different teas, cereals, coffee, juice  and yoghurt for breakfast.  The room we stayed in (there are others) was spacious and bright during the day, and it had blackout shades and curtains for sleeping in past the early Dublin dawn.  She is a really interesting and fun person to talk to and has lots of tips for seeing the area.  Take a cab from the airport because there's no direct way to get there using public transport, though you can use buses or the train to get into the city in about 45 minutes from her quiet neighborhood."
6636633,447900974,5/4/2019,"Imelda is a great host! Her place is a quick walk to the bus stop to get to Dublins city center where all the action is located. The bus takes about 10 minutes and costs 3 Euro per person so just make sure you have coins. She greeted us on arrival, showed us how to work everything and gave us our space to rest. Imelda was very hospitable and provided cereal, yogurt and toast for us to grab in the morning. The bed was comfortable and we had a great nights rest. She does have a few rooms available for AirBnB so you may have other people staying there as well. This wasnt a big deal, we never even saw the other guests. Overall great experience, would recommend."

I highly recommend this place
6636633,457143623,5/23/2019,"Imelda is a great host with superb hospitality and a great heart.

YOUR A STAR! X"
6636633,476092870,6/25/2019,Imelda has a nice house a bit outside Dublin. We went into the city centre with the DART and that was quite easy to do.

6636633,524235743,9/5/2019,"Imelda is the kind of host that goes above and beyond and it shows!

All the linen smelled amazingly fresh and the beds are made super tight with thoughtful touches - like candy on the night stand and nicely folded towels on the comforter.

The entire home is sparkling clean like a 5 star hotel and smells great.

She offers a nice breakfast in the mornings with great advice on transportation throughout town.

The room is a short hop away from the 27A Bus or the Dart train from Harmonstown.

Extras included a charging converter because I didn't even think to bring one.

A+ would recommend.

Don't think about it, just book it!"
6636633,526043018,9/8/2019,"My mother and I visited Dublin for the weekend and Imelda's place was the perfect stay for us! She will really make sure you feel 100% comfortable at her house. The place was clean, tidy and had beautiful little touches such as flowers and candleholders. Every morning we had a breakfast that Imelda provided - a wide selection of jams, spreads, as well as pastry, bread, coffees and teas. Imelda was very responsive to any of my questions prior to our arrival. She gave us some great recommendations about buying the city card and saving money, as well as some places to see. Her place is a comfortable bus ride from the city centre and in a great, quiet location. Thank you Imelda for being the perfect host! 
Jalia & Tara"
6636633,527702313,9/11/2019,She is very nice and her place is very organized. There is close by bus stop by 5mins walking distance. Personally I like the most bed where I slept one of the comfy bed so far:) hopefully I will visit her again. Thanks for being a great host :)
6636633,530885869,9/16/2019,Imelda's home is excellent and made us feel at home. As many others have stated she makes you feel like part of the family. Her knowledge of the area and recommendations made the stay amazing!

6636633,547495701,10/15/2019,"Imeldas home reminded me of the pensiones I stayed in Italy when I was a college student, except much much nicer. Imelda herself was lovely and very helpful. I did like my room; the bed was very comfortable with adequate coverings, lots of space to hang things, toiletries provided. Very quiet at night, easy to sleep. She also provided a stack of books and flyers of things to do in case you havent yet planned your trip. I appreciated that Imelda provided a very nice breakfast. My only frustration was the bathroom situation (sharing between four other guests; no shower after 9:30pm; showers to be kept to 5-10 minutes; having to wait over an hour in the morning when you really need to use the facilities) was somewhat frustrating. That aside, I enjoyed my stay."
6636633,551470411,10/20/2019,Perfect room if you spend a weekend in Dublin. In walking distance to public transport and a close taxi ride from the airport. Definitely better than all the noisy stays in the city centre!
6636633,554443611,10/26/2019,We had a nice time in the BnB and the connection to Dublin city by DART railway is really good.

6637187,431035819,3/31/2019,A nice location very close to Guinness on the West side of the city. There was an oversight in cleaning the location  prior to our arrival but the site contact was super responsive in resolving the issue immediately. I would absolutely consider this location again for future visits to Dublin.
6637187,436052593,4/12/2019,"Lots of stairs, lots of neighbours, lots of nearby shops, clean apartment in the west of the city centre, bus stop right in front of it."
6637187,437890843,4/15/2019,Perfect for a short stay close to Dublin City Centre. Within walking distance of many attractions e.g. Temple bar and Guinness factory.
6637187,443659289,4/26/2019,"Apt nice and clean. Contact with Host fast and easy. I can recommend this house. Only thing what i missed there was lack of info about way of working the water heating system, info about wifi password and maybe easier (more clear) instruction how to get to apt."
6637187,449357407,5/6/2019,The stay went well. Very helpful and great suggestions for places to see while in Dublin. Would have liked more privacy in the shower as it seemed like it was missing a door. Very kind and helpful person.
6637187,450033251,5/8/2019,Great stylish space located close to the Guinness store house and within walking distance to center of Dublin. We had a great stay and would stay here again!
6637187,453552113,5/16/2019,"Not exactly what we were expecting .. very basic accommodations. 

little confusing with contradicting addresses and information - he will send you an email with further information. That address was correct, so ignore the apps information. Also, the key sticks in the top bolt. 

WiFi password was hard to find - the instructions stated the password was posted on a whiteboard. We did not see a whiteboard in the apartment .. So we flagged down the sweet, excellent and extremely helpful cleaning lady! 

The hot water was a timed thing, so it was harder to get hot water.   I didnt get a hot shower for 3 days..

There was an issue with other Airbnb tenants in the building trying to get in their room. There was a ton of banging, chasing, and loud noise - I called the host to give him a heads up or ask for assistance. No word back from him."
6637187,457955577,5/25/2019,"5 stars! Exceeded expectations. Comfortable, cosy and sparkling clean! A great find. Would definitely book to stay again when visiting Dublin."
6637187,458769366,5/26/2019,Good location for guiness factory and Kilmainham gaol prison. Easy check in and helpful host. Room ok for 1 night
6637187,460799442,5/30/2019,"The place is 25 minutes walk from the centre. Taking the bus or LUAS is quite expensive, about 3 pounds for a single journey. Lots of drunk people around, I helped one of them one day as he was lying on the pavement. Another day a bike was stolen from the shop next to the flat. The floor had not been cleaned properly, and the bed sheet and duvet cover didn't look clean. The shop next to the flat is very expensive. Water is a bit of an issue, as if you forget to put the timer on you can't get a hot shower. On the positive side, the big bus stops just in front of the flat. We did a ticket for the entire stay and we could move easily. The Guinness storehouse is around the corner. Christian is very friendly and responsive, and allowed us to leave the luggage after check out. Many trips to Lidl nearby (10 mins walk) which has good prices. Overall we managed to have a good holiday."
6637187,466345590,6/9/2019,"We didnt actually stay here in the end as it hadnt been cleaned, but Christian sorted out alternative accommodation for us."
6637187,469859516,6/15/2019,"Everything was as described on Airbnb! The flat is a 20 minute walk from the city centre. There is a small market just downstair, which is useful to grab a bite for breakfast/dinner."
6637187,472272745,6/19/2019,Grest location close to Guinness and other pubs and places to eat. Friendly host with lots of tips for things to do. Place was quite clean and comfortable.  Would stay here again.
6637187,478026121,6/29/2019,Very modern and recently remodeled.  Two minutes walk from the Guinness Storehouse and a couple of excellent pubs.  A slightly longer walk to central Dublin and Phoenix Park.  Highly recommended.
6637187,480168926,7/2/2019,Small clean and easy to get around. 20 minute walk to temple bar and 5 minute walk to Guinness storehouse. We would definitely stay here again if we come back. Check in was easy and communication was quick.
6637187,481715292,7/5/2019,You can't get closer to the home of Guinness
6637187,484134398,7/8/2019,"The apartment had a great location so we were walking distance of what we wanted to do as well as a few convenience stores for snacks. The space was very clean and we appreciated that the living room had a door to add privacy to those sleeping on the pull out. The pull out was much bigger than we expected and comfortably slept two people. Christian provided detailed instructions on checking in and we had no issues, he was also quick to respond with the few questions we had."
6637187,485764703,7/11/2019,"Great stay, great host!"

6637187,504904220,8/8/2019,Suits the needs for the stay. Bit of a walk from the city center
6637187,508134742,8/12/2019,"Well equiped apartment. The price is high, but so it is in all Dublin. Although beeing a third floor without elevator, it is close to the city centre by foot, what is very convenient to save money in public transport, which is expensive in Dublin.
Recommendable."
6637187,512463831,8/18/2019,A basic apartment but in a central location.
6637187,518333881,8/26/2019,Great place located next to the guinness museum and 20 minute walk  from the temple bar district

6637187,520416324,8/30/2019,Good location and all you need for a great stay in Dublin
6637187,524147222,9/5/2019,"My friends and I visited Dublin to see a show at Vicar Street, and chose this apartment because it's within 10 mins walking distance. 
This apartment is slightly outside of the centre of Dublin but is conveniently located opposite a bus stop with regular buses right into the heart of the city.  It was very clean and comfortable with a particularly nice bathroom. There's a small supermarket a few doors down if you're planning on self-catering and a nice coffee shop very close by as well. 
The apartment is extremely convenient if you want to visit the Guinness storehouse. 

I'd definitely choose this apartment again if visiting Dublin again in the future, the hosts were great communicators and were kind enough to provide some tips for what to see locally."
6637187,527278206,9/10/2019,A clean and cosy appartment. Perfect for a quick visit to Dublin.
6637187,528580656,9/13/2019,The location of this place is perfect. Right in center city around everything you could want. All within walking distance. It was perfect for us! I would defiantly stay here again!

6637187,549981232,10/18/2019,Great location. Just as described.
6637187,552236518,10/21/2019,"Great location to Attractions ( Guinness brewery, The goal, hop on & hop off bus at front door). Number of pubs close by for good meals and a pint.  Flat is above a small store which catered for all food stuffs.  Great location and Facilities are also good.  recommend"
6637187,558700472,11/3/2019,Great location. Clean. Lots of space. Highly recommend.
6649602,441620668,4/22/2019,"It was such a cosy place in such a quiet neighbourhood after a busy day around Dublin. The 30-minute walk till the city center was really great! Jane was always so kind and we found everything there for us. Needless to say, it's a space for two people, but you'll find everything you need there, and even more! We totally recommend this place!"
6649602,449246785,5/6/2019,"Probably my best airbnb experiences, The appartment is in such a nice area in Dublin, very close to the city, 5 stars"
6649602,452508597,5/13/2019,The accommodation was excellent with extra touches of food in the fridge on our arrival.  There were easy directions from the airport and clear instructions and maps left in the unit.  We loved the charming area of Dublin and the quiet beauty of the Square. Thankyou for allowing for an early checkin. Everything was excellent!
6649602,454383424,5/18/2019,"This apartment was a perfect base for exploring Dublin and its neighborhoods. We walked or took one of many buses that run into Dublin. There are coffee shops and restaurants nearby.

The apartment is just off a main street but is very quiet and tucked away within a lovely courtyard. (The last time we stayed in Dublin we were right in the center of the nightlife area and the noise kept us up until all hours.)

The airport bus stops right nearby and is convenient for getting to and from the airport. 

Well be back to stay here - it was convenient to the city center and we enjoyed being in a quiet area!"
6649602,460108970,5/28/2019,"Elizabeth and Janes apartment is located in a comfortable and quiet gated community that is just outside downtown Dublin. We selected it because of its convenient location near downtown and UCD, where I was attending a meeting. Bus stops are close-by and provide convenient transport. The apartment is described accurately and the kitchen is well-stocked if you wish to do some cooking. We would happily stay here again."
6649602,462468782,6/2/2019,"Aanrader voor bezoek Dublin
Wel iets verder weg van centrum.
Schoon, compleet, veilige locatie."
6649602,467257427,6/10/2019,"This place was a wonderful find. We felt instantly at home (4 nights) in its comfort as well as beautiful landscaping to look at. We arrived jet lagged and there were a variety of coffees, teas, bread, cookies, and snacks to make a little lunch. 
    We never waited more than a few minutes for 1 of the 3 busses for a short ride into the city center (we got the 72 hr DoDublin card & used every feature). We knew we could always get a bus back from Nassau St adjacent to Trinity College.  The walk into the center was very doable. 
     The wonderful Donneybrook Fair supermarket a block away made it easy to eat breakfast and most dinners in (we had to buy dinners out on a 7 day tour when we left).  And it had s great selection of wine and local craft beer. 
      This place is a keeper!!!   
A practical  note - if tickets to Kilmainham Gaol are sold out they release more tickets online at 9-9:15 am every day."
6649602,471828731,6/18/2019,"Elizabeth & Janes place was wonderful! We could not have asked for a better experience in this quiet, close neighborhood to Dublin City Centre."
6649602,474454384,6/23/2019,"Situated in a lovely residential area.
The house is spotlessly clean and well equipped. 
Close to local amenities and short taxi ride to a number of great pubs and restaurants. 
Highly recommend this AirBnB."
6649602,559508419,11/4/2019,"The place full of nice touches, hospitality wise. Close to the center if you like to walk a bit, even better if you're a traveler with your own car as we were. The house was warm and sparkling clean, and despite we never met Jane, she was always in touch and extremely prompt in helping us if we had needed her. No doubt I'll book this place if I come to Dublin again."
6653369,421003951,3/8/2019,"Sauber, unkompliziert, freundlich, zentru (Hidden by Airbnb) ah - Jederzeit wieder!"
6653369,422507186,3/11/2019,Mariusz was a great host. He made sure we had all we needed and was quick to fix any issues we had. The apartment is conveniently located very near a tram station that you can use to get in 10 mins to city centre. If we return to Dublin we would gladly stay here again.
6653369,423139789,3/13/2019,"Mariusz gave us helpful travel recommendations. The space is as advertised and the location is great!Close enough to walk to the touristic areas, but also right in from of a train stop that can take you there even faster. Great value!"
6653369,426179045,3/20/2019,"Mariusz was an amazing host. His place was wonderful to stay at. Very clean and the place was very nice and quiet. He was easy to talk to and very friendly.

6653369,431646990,4/1/2019,"Mariusz's place was a nice flat about a 5 minute drive from the main tourist areas of Dublin.  The location had free parking on the street and access to the tram directly out front.  This is an area that I would consider up and coming, but it is not the best part of Dublin."
6653369,432607130,4/4/2019,"Really nice apartment, central and with a train station right across the street, which makes it really easy to get to all the sightseeing spots! :)"
6653369,437021215,4/14/2019,"The room and the bathroom were really cozy, modern and perfectly clean.

6653369,441792108,4/22/2019,Booked for my son and his girlfriend - and they had a brilliant time.  They loved the apartment (and fact they didn't need to take towels and toiletries) and my communications with Mariusz were excellent.
6653369,442714966,4/24/2019,Mariusz was a fantastic host. He greeted us very promptly and made us feel very welcome. He provided us with many recommendations and was available to answer questions. His place was very clean and very well decorated. The bed is comfortable and the location is ideal (right by public transportation). We would definitely stay here again.
6653369,444664407,4/28/2019,"Mariusz is a very friendly and welcoming host. I felt comfortable from the moment we met. His apartment is in a great location for connecting to public transportation in Dublin.  The room is clean and private with very modern bath attached, and super comfortable bed. I think Mariusz covered everything I could want or need to be comfortable. I am a single, senior, female adventurer and this stay couldn't have been better. I would highly recommend staying with Mariusz."
6653369,446448451,5/1/2019,"Tutto molto bene, check in facile, posizione ottima davanti alla fermata della tramvia. Appartamento carino, arredato con gusto, bel box doccia. Mariusz ci ha fatto sentire a casa, facile comunicare con lui e sempre disponibile."

Transport too & from was so easy & was so nice to know I could just text Mariusz or Junior for any help or directions.

6653369,456772879,5/22/2019,"Mariusz' pad is right across from the LUAS stop, making it very easy to hop on the red line and travel downtown. The location is also within walking distance of the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Kilmainham Jail, where you can take an excellent tour. This was my first time not staying in an Airbnb all to myself, and Mariusz made me feel most welcome and at home. It was great to have a conversation together about his experiences and observations about Ireland. I highly recommend staying with Mariusz."
6653369,457542064,5/24/2019,"We had a very positive experience with the host, who was very helpful and friendly. The room itself was tight for two people- the king frame (with queen mattress) and was pushed against the wall, making the bed hard to access for one person. The furniture provided made it possible to put away clothes but left little room to open and spread out suitcases other than on the bed. 

Very convenient to the tram, just across the street, which allowed us to access the entire city easily."
6653369,460102325,5/28/2019,"Mariusz is super friendly and welcoming host. We felt great at his place. The apartment is very stylish, close to city center and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Thank you Mariusz."

It was a pleasure to met Mariusz and our late arrival at 11pm wasnt a problem for him. He was very friendly, offered us coffee, water, Wifi, shampoo and a map of Dublin. We very recommend Mariusz and his apartement and would definitely stay a second time there."
6653369,464366958,6/5/2019,"This place is absolutely wonderful. One of the best I have ever stayed at. It is right across from the Luas which is PERFECT! The space itself is clean, hip, and safe. I would love to stay anytime!!!"
6653369,467889966,6/11/2019,Mariusz's place was wonderful. The space was very clean and stylish. We loved that the tram was conveniently located and easy to use. We really appreciated that the host let us drop off our luggage before our check In time so we wouldn't have to worry about hauling them around as we explored the city. The early check in was a huge bonus as we were very jet-lagged. We highly recommend staying at this Airbnb
6653369,471277639,6/17/2019,"Great apartment, with tram stop right outside to allow for quick and easy access into Dublin City centre. 
Mariusz went out of his way to help return some lost items so that was very much appreciated. Highly recommend staying here. Thanks"
6653369,473212800,6/21/2019,"We stayed at 3 Airbnb's during our 2 week trip through UK/Ireland and we can safely say, Mariusz was by far the best host we had! We flew in early and he was not only willing to let us drop our bags off early, but made us coffee, provided us with a map of Dublin and shared his recommendations of places to go and see. My husband and I prefer to walk everywhere we go, we found it very easy to do from this location, but Mariusz's place is right across the street from the tram if you choose to use it. The place itself was beautiful and incredibly clean. It does get a little noisy some nights so I'd recommend ear plugs, but this was expected as all big cities have this issue. I wouldn't take a star away for that."
6653369,476466951,6/26/2019,Mariusz is a perfect host. He is really friendly and helpful. The room is sparkly clean and very well decorated. The bed is really comfy. There is a tram station just in front of the house.
6653369,476869340,6/27/2019,"Very considerate host, and a lovely clean apartment. Very easy to get into the city centre, we walked which took around 15 minutes."
6653369,480697133,7/3/2019,"Mariusz is an exceptional host! His home is clean, inviting and overall amazing! Mariusz is extremely accommodating- providing maps of the city, personal recommendations, coffee in the morning, and available for any questions or concerns. Home is conveniently located to Guinness Factory and other tourist attractions. I HIGHLY recommend him and his home for any traveler."
6653369,481107756,7/4/2019,"Mariusz has the gift of design.  His place is so cool - classy, full of modern art, every detail is thoughtfully designed.    It is very comfortable and private with a keyed entrance to the room as well.  Great location. We loved staying there...hes the nicest guy - ready to help, friendly, kind, easy to share space with."

6653369,485735019,7/11/2019,Mariusz was very friendly and recommended great things to do in Dublin. His place was very clean and we loved the decorations and style. We found it really useful that the Tram stopped right in front of the building. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!
6653369,486863528,7/13/2019,It was a great place with easy transit options! Would gladly stay again if I went to Dublin again!
6653369,489152568,7/16/2019,"Mariusz has gone to great detail to present his place very nicely with lots of interesting and appropriate touches.
The apartment is very clean and if you are prepared to share spaces with others then it has everything you need.
The local area whilst very convenient for transport and location to the city, was unfortunately very noisy with voices from the street being heard well into the morning."
6653369,490915544,7/19/2019,"Mariuszs apartment is really stylish and clean. It was nice to come back to after a long day of walking around Dublin.Mariusz was friendly and made us feel at home. There is a tram station just across so easy to get into the centre, or u can just walk"

6653369,495715706,7/26/2019,"We stayed two nights at Mariusz apartment and it was great. He is such an open and kind person, so that we really rather felt like meeting a friend than being at a stangers place. 
The apartment is really stylish and the bed very comfy. It is very close to a Luas station from which you can easily go downtown. 
A cafe nearby offers good and cheap breakfast and to-go options.

Thank you Mariusz!"
6653369,497209271,7/28/2019,"Very nice, quiet appartement, located directly opposite of the tramway, that brings you into the center within 10-15 min. Great for a short stay in Dublin."

6653369,501880487,8/4/2019,We had an awesome two nights with Marious who has a very well designed home and close to all the tourist places we wanted to see.  All around he made our trip Dublin an excellent experience.
6653369,503579814,8/6/2019,"Mariusz is very hospital and helpful, and his place is super comfortable and stylish. It was a perfect stay in Dublin for us!"
6653369,504302080,8/7/2019,"This was the perfect place to stay for the first leg of my Ireland adventure. I was able to park on the street behind the apartment and Mariusz was kind enough to let me drop my suitcase off early in the day. The train station was right across the street and so I was able to zip into temple bar in about 15 minutes, or walk there in about 25. Mariusz was responsive and helpful. Highly recommend!"
6653369,508183845,8/12/2019,"it was amazing experience. Mariusz is so kind and helpful.  Place is amazing! very unique style.  very quiet street ,tram is across the street. i recommend this place. thank you Mariusz for host us !"

The location is right across from the tram, two stops down from a major hub, 10 minutes to the center of action. Everything is spotless, well decorated, and designed to meet a travelers need. 

In advance of my visit, Mariusz communicated clearly & was super accommodating about letting me bring my bags over early instead of lugging them around all day. 

10/10 would stay here again!"
6653369,511245868,8/17/2019,The place is amazing. Very beautiful! Everything like on the pictures and even better! Perfect as well to park a car and reach the city by foot or tram! Just go there its great!
6653369,513200789,8/19/2019,"I highly recommend booking at Mariuszs place. The place is well decorated and very clean. The appartement is walking distance from the city center and there is a tram station across the street if you dont feel like walking. 
Mariusz was very accommodating and friendly ! 10/10"
6653369,513875417,8/20/2019,Beautiful and stylish apartment with everything we needed for our stay! Looks just like the photos. Mariusz was very accommodating and we were in a key location right next to the tram and actually walked quite a few key places in the city! I would definitely recommend to all.
6653369,514432841,8/21/2019,The place was beautiful and incredibly well decorated. The on-suite bathroom and bedroom were very clean. Mariusz communicated well and quickly. Definitely the nicest Airbnb I have stayed in thus far.
6653369,516496897,8/24/2019,"Super suggested!

About the apartment: you can find all amenities listed by the announcement, the pictures correspond to reality, the location is very clever in front of the Fatima Luas stop (red line is the line perfect to reach the city center). 

About Mariusz: he's so helpful and friendly, always attentive to the guests needs. He's respectful but also a funny person who make you feel, for sure, as an old friend."

6653369,523702056,9/4/2019,"Mariusz was away during our stay, so his friend Junior greeted us and gave us a tour and instructions on how to check out. He was very friendly and made us feel at home. It was a beautiful and cosy apartment that's steps away from a Luas stop and within walking distance to all the major attractions. Would definitely stay there again if we're ever back in Dublin!"
6653369,525046275,9/7/2019,"Our stay here was incredible! Mariusz is a fantastic host who was extremely kind, had plenty of information about the city and made our stay so very easy and comfortable! His friend Junior was also very helpful and kind as well! Absolutely amazing stay!"
6653369,526695635,9/9/2019,"Spent a couple nights at Mariuszs place in Dublin. Extremely convenient location. 10 minute walk to Guinness Storehouse, 30 second walk to the Fatima Luas stop. The Luas run frequently, so getting into town was never a task. Excellent value, would recommend."

6653369,536659800,9/27/2019,Great space neat legendary Guinness Factory. Makes extra efforts to communicate promptly and with tact. Stylish space that suits all your needs to rest your head. Would definitely recommend this host.

6653369,557615357,11/1/2019,"I had a great stay at Mariusz apartment, it was very clean and tidy. The bedroom had a private bathroom which had towels, hairdryer, body wash and shampoo. Good location, I used the tram to get into the city and the stop is right outside the apartment. 
Mariusz was a great host, very friendly and respectful. I would definitely recommend staying here"
6653369,558936149,11/3/2019,What a beautiful gem this apartment is. Stayed in Mariusz apartment for 2 day and really felt comfortable and welcoming. I was met with a warm smile from Mariusz who really is a brilliant host. As a creative person I absolutely loved the decor and the photography vibe it has to offer. Very chilled and relaxed atmospheric vibes. The luas tram is literally across the road from the apartment. Commuting into the city centre is about 10 minutes on the luas tram. Highly recommend. :)
6653369,562083423,11/10/2019,"Very well furnished house, very clean and 5 minutes from the city center by tram.  Recommended!  Mariusz is a perfect host."

6655079,481652566,7/5/2019,"Such a lovely place to stay, quite and relaxing and so so comfortable. Patsey is a very welcoming host, and makes you feel at home, I was spoilt, I even got offered dinner on my first night which was so sound after a days work. Thank you Patsey! Louise"
6655079,515131437,8/22/2019,I had a fabulous stay at Patsey's lovely place. She is very helpful and makes you feel at home and is a great host. I would highly recommend and hope to stay again.
6655079,532626776,9/20/2019,Patseys place is terrific. Lovely location and neighbourhood with a comfortable bed and great amenities. Patsey goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable in her home and makes a great cup of tea. Patsey also offers breakfast which is a great bonus and there is plenty of parking outside her place as well. Thanks Patsey for a fab stay!
6655655,466335172,6/9/2019,"Great value for Dublin.  This home appears to be located just on the edge of a nice neighborhood, but be warned that a direct route via gps to the Guinness Storehouse will take you through some sketchy areas.  

The house is clean in the rooms and bathrooms, but needs some elbow grease in the common areas.  The couch is pretty nasty.  They have, however spent some time recently renovating the bathrooms and bedrooms and they look great.  

The upstairs shower lost pressure after one shower.  It became a trickle you couldnt even wash your hands with.  The best shower is the downstairs one as it is consistent and also doesnt fluctuate between cold and scalding over and over again as is common with pump showers in Ireland.  

The host was very friendly and accommodated us on short notice."
6655655,469869651,6/15/2019,"Overall stay was good. It would have been even better if the house door had a number, the street had more parking space with cars not blocking the road and the downstairs bathroom was cleaner. However, despite these issues, the overall stay was still good and the rest of the house was clean. Carmel was good with responding to questions."
6656611,524591259,9/6/2019,Patsey is a wonderful host and she has a beautiful and clean home
6656611,537182028,9/28/2019,"Patsey is very friendly and helpful. The place and room is very nice too. For my taste, the bed was too firm. The list of rules was just a bit much for me too feel completely at ease at times. Proximity to the train station was not bad but at night the bus takes an hour to get back from centre town. I liked meeting Patsey and she was very helpful, offering food and drink while I was battling a cold."
6656611,548336650,10/17/2019,Had a great stay at Patsey's home which is immaculate and Patsey is a great host . Highly recommended.
6657775,421332362,3/9/2019,Maria met me on the first night from the Luas and explained  everything so carefully about keys/access/the cat/how everything worked. Good WiFi. Apartment clean with everything I needed for a week stay. Maria is great to communicate with at home and over the messaging service on the air BnB app. Thanks for the great stay Maria.
6657775,422488973,3/11/2019,Maria is a superhost! She is really kind and she helped me planning my journey! The house is very close to the Guinness storehouse and furthermore there is the Luas stop exactly in front of the house which goes straight to the city centre! Thanks again for everything!
6657775,425907026,3/19/2019,"Loved my stay at Maria's apartment. It was conveniently located near the Laus Red Line, but it is also a quick 20 minute walk to city centre from her place. Maria was thoughtful and helpful. She gave great advise on what to do in Dublin. We had lovely and hilarious conversations when I came back in the evenings.  I highly recommend staying with Maria when travelling to Dublin."
6657775,427792504,3/24/2019,Maria is very kind. I was happy to be her guest for few days. The appartment was perfect and very clean.
6657775,430801013,3/31/2019,"Its a neat and cozy place and I slept very well there. Maria is a great hostess, explained everything and cared about my comfort. The place is very close to the Luas station, bus stops also nearby, and 20 -30 minutes walking distance to downtown. Recommend!"
6657775,433330627,4/6/2019,"Clean and cosy, a nice stay"
6657775,435750439,4/11/2019,"Nice warm and tidy place. Everything explained as required.

6657775,440064880,4/20/2019,"My stay at Maria's house war perfect !
The apartment is really clean and cosy, its location is really good (2min from Luas Red Line, then around 15min from Dublin center). Maria is an excellent host, she will make you feel at home and she is always ready to help. I highly recommend !"

6657775,442332048,4/23/2019,"Great host, great property . Quick transports links into town. Lovely historic building, loads of style."
6657775,443534644,4/26/2019,"Great location for the Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery, but not for spending the night in downtown Dublin. I recommend this for a quiet night, but not for late drinking or for anyone other than a solo traveler. 

Keep in mind that you'll carry your luggage around until 7pm as it's a late checkin"
6657775,444068884,4/27/2019,Maria is a very pleasant host. Her place is right near a Luas stop so it was handy enough to get to and from Heuston Station. Good value.
6657775,448604453,5/5/2019,Marias flat is absolutely perfect for a solo traveler. The space has everything you need and the tram thats just across the street is super easy to navigate anywhere you could want to go in Dublin (and thats coming from someone who is not great with public transportation). Maria is a wonderful host and makes you feel right at home.
6657775,450794533,5/10/2019,"Lovely well located flat . Great transport links . Couldnt recommend  the host enough.

6657775,460916860,5/30/2019,Maria provides lovely accommodation which is meters from the Luas stop.  Such a comfortable bed and she was an exceptional host.  Thank you very much Maria
6657775,461350018,5/31/2019,"For some unusual reasons I had to stay at 8 different locations in Dublin, Marias being both the last and best place. As advertised the room is on the small size but is well furnished and completely comfortable for the single traveller.  Access to a fridge and other kitchen faculties is easy and invited. The tram line is a minute away and for ‚Ç¨7+ for all day travel in Dublin very cheap and convenient. Maria is was great in every way to make my stay a fine one."
6657775,461789338,6/1/2019,Perfect for a single traveler. Extremely close to a public transit stop. It's a good spot to crash for a night while visiting Dublin. Host was very kind. :)
6657775,462602855,6/2/2019,"Maria has a beautiful very clean home and is a wonderful host ! It couldnt be better! Thank you Maria , and as lm not a very good traveler and needed a lot of information and help , l appreciated all this very needed advice to find my way around , 
Warm wishes Josephine"
6657775,463941656,6/4/2019,Very cosy and warm (Website hidden by Airbnb) host.Hopefully will use room again.
6657775,464696572,6/6/2019,A lovely quiet room near to the city centre. Maria is such a friendly host- she even came to meet me at the nearby Luas stop .
6657775,466438491,6/9/2019,"Maria is a fantastic host. She was very helpful before I came, she sent me several useful informations. She is a great host, very welcoming. And the accommodation is so clean! The room is very nice and the bed is fantastic. No noise from the outside, very quiet and one minute from the Luas, few minutes by Luas to downtown. I highly recommend this location. Thank you Maria."

6657775,479763576,7/1/2019,"Maria is a lovely friendly lady, presenting a clean comfy flat. Enjoyed my stay there.
The 747 bus takes an hour to Houston station then short tram trip, its about a mile to the main centre from the tram stop but an easy walk along the Liffey, would recommend."
6657775,482247104,7/6/2019,"Maria was a great host. She met me at the Luas tram stop and gave me a very detailed explanation of everything. Sparkling clean, steps from public transport and nice touches."
6657775,483328072,7/7/2019,"Room was great, bed was great, shower was great, and the host was the most!"
6657775,484114625,7/8/2019,"Superclean, easy communication, quiet neighbourhood, nice bed."
6657775,488553819,7/15/2019,"Maria met me at the trolly stop and walked me over to her flat.  It took less than 5 minutes.  Once I got into the flat I could smell a cat box.  Maria explained to me about five times how to shut my bedroom door.  When I moved the night stand to plug in my phone, Maria moved the nightstand back to its original place - she didn't even give me a chance to.  There were about 59 rules for using the kitchen.  Maria mentioned no less than three times not to open the doors quickly or I would bump her cat.  Unfortunately, I could not understand how to make the front door lock and unlock.  Again, there were like 48 steps to make the door lock and unlock.  Maybe it was because I had had a very long flight and an even longer day, but I had a difficult time putting all the steps together to make the door lock and unlock.  Maria was so rude when I made mistakes.  She was condescending, impolite, impatient and did not hide her anger with me.  The whole experience was so awful that I just gave up and checked myself into a hotel.  I just left Maria's space altogether.  Not recommended."
6657775,494472007,7/24/2019,Brilliant pit stop
6657775,502126820,8/4/2019,Maria help the person for any thing like call for a taxi. A warm welcome and an clear understand about my need.
6657775,505400952,8/9/2019,"Maria is a wonderful host - very welcoming and personable, great chat.  The flat itself is sparkling clean and comfortable.  Personally I really liked the location as transport links are excellent, the area is quiet, and its not in the middle of the city."
6657775,507073112,8/11/2019,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6657775,507445342,8/11/2019,"This Host cancelled my reservation on night my Stay!
Maria had decided that I was not the man in my profile Picture (it was me!, a picture 5 years old and few lbs extra)  and she stubbornly refused me access to the place.
Maria seriously underestimates how stressful this is for a client. That night in Dublin, there was multiple events in City and it was next to impossible find another place or Hotel.
While AirBnB were trying their best to find a suitable replacement ... it took hours. Four and a half hours in fact.
I have used AirBnB multiple times across Ireland and Europe, and have never experienced this behaviour. I have always got very positive reviews from everyone I stayed with, and I had also presented Maria my Passport/Driving Licence/Credit Card ... But, She still refused me access to place. As ""I was not the person in Photo""???. 
She even had the vulgarity to say ""The Person in the Photo looks Healthy"".
After 4 and a half stressful hours, AirBnB managed to finally find me a replacement accommodation, and this ""unhealthy"" person did manage to run the Dublin half Marathon :)

Unless you want stress and drama ... avoid this host!"
6657775,513420593,8/19/2019,"Maria was an excellent host who gave me all the information I needed to be welcome, comfortable and secure in her home and in the city in general. The space is cosy but perfect for a solo traveller and the transport links really are as convenient as described (the Luas is good but for a real experience, try the city bikes!) Thanks again for a fab stay, would definitely come back!"
6657775,517158819,8/25/2019,Cute place with a cute cat. Maria is lovely and helpful. I'd recommend buying a public transport ticket from the info shops in the city to make it easier to get around
6657775,520347353,8/30/2019,"Maria was really friendly and welcoming. The room is small but really nice, impeccable cleanliness and the main convenience is the tram almost in front of the house. Super recommended!"
6657775,521834397,9/1/2019,"Lovely space, very clean and great location. Plus, Maria was great and very helpful at check in!"
6657775,524081556,9/5/2019,Maria was a wonderful host. Her home is spotlessly clean in a brilliant location for traveling in Dublin.
6657775,525085179,9/7/2019,"Maria was great, knows the area well and will go out of her way for you need something. comfy spot for anyone traveling alone and near downtown area. Her cat is also cute!"
6657775,526030162,9/8/2019,"Maria was kind enough to meet me at the trolley stop and show me the way to get to her home, just a very short walk from the station. 
Her place is up a flight of steps from the street and then one more flight inside a hallway. Her apartment is small and because of who Maria is, it felt cozy and somehow familiar. 
I had a wonderful conversation with Maria on the night I was there, which made her home a warm place to visit. My room was on the small side but quite clean and neat. The kitchen was small as was the shared bathroom but everything was adequate for a one night stay. 
Marias Place was the way AirBnB s used to be. Youd open up your home to a traveler who needed a humble accommodation for a night or two. Youd give them a clean room and comfortable bed, some nice meaningful conversation that theyd never forget, and then in the morning wish them a good journey. All for a good price. 
That was my experience with Maria."
6657775,532659607,9/20/2019,"Great location,  close to the Luas and St James's hospital.  Parking in street.  Welcomed by Maria, helped with my luggage, shown around the property and all facilitates demonstrated."

6657851,440905373,4/21/2019,Very nice and friendly host. The location is better than one may have expected. Its a bit suburban and quiet and there is a railway station and bus stop within 3 mins walking distance. Strongly recommend the bus 37 which takes you to anywhere of the city centre in 20-30 mins and it runs very frequently and on time. We went out one night and took uber home which costed ‚Ç¨20 ish. The room we stayed for the night was clean and has a very nice view over a greenspace. We had our own spacious bathroom adjacent to our room. The Phoenix Park is also near. Highly recommended.

6657851,478863416,6/30/2019,"You can expect a cozy little room with THE BEST hospitality on the planet. Marie was waiting in the front garden for us and waved as we walked through the park from the train station. She allowed us to check in early so we could drop off our luggage before touring the city. Breakfast was provided each morning: fruit and granola, bread with butter and marmalade, and tea. Marie even set it out on Friday night because we had to be up and out early on Saturday morning. This place is easily accessible by train and bus. We loved having a homey space to come back to each evening. And we had some great conversations with Marie and Tom. Highly recommend this spot and hope to come back soon."
6657851,492324192,7/21/2019,It's nice to stay in Dublin in the house of Marie. She's very kind and helpfull. With the bus or train it's easy to go to the centre of Dublin (about 20-30 minutes).

6657851,539495957,10/1/2019,My friend and I had the best stay at Maries place! She and her husband were so hospitable and helpful in every way with tips for the city and how to use the bus. She had breakfast for us every morning and was there every night before we went to bed. The location is great because its not in the busy and loud city center but its an easy bus ride from the corner of the street. Theres also a small town in walking distance to get food if you dont want to go into the city. Would recommend to anyone staying near Dublin!
6657851,541565961,10/5/2019,"Marie and her husband are exceptional hosts. They are very warm and welcoming, making it feel like your own home from home. The house is clean with close train and bus links to the city centre. In a fairly expensive city, it's also great value for money! 
Thanks Marie! :)"
6657851,546971968,10/14/2019,My friend and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was perfect. Easy to get into the town centre from there. Lovely area for a good night's sleep and we were meet by such warm hospitality + a great breakfast! We loved staying at Marie's :D

6659169,418443837,3/2/2019,"My fiancee and I spent a month with Siobhan and Rudy while studying in Dublin. I am not exaggerating when I say that Siobhan became family to us during our stay! She is genuinely one of the kindest, warmest, and most open-hearted people I have ever met. She was very supportive throughout our time and regularly helped my fiancee and I with making plans for day trips, visits around the area, and discovering the best pubs to frequent. 

She made fantastic breakfasts for us every morning with fresh-baked croissants, freshly-squeezed orange juice, mixed berries and fruit, yogurt, homemade granola, and tea & coffee. She opened her home to us while also being extremely respectful of our private space.

She has a lovely home that is just a short walk to city centre in the sweet Phibsboro neighborhood. Rudy (Siobhan's hound) is shy, but extremely loveable and I won him over with a good back scratch or two. 

Connecting with Siobhan was one of the happiest accidents of our trip. I must say: THANK YOU AirBnB for bringing such a cool person into our lives! If you have read this far and haven't booked yet, I would recommend jumping on it -- you will not be disappointed.

Dear Siobhan, until next time -- may it come swiftly!"
6659169,422006460,3/10/2019,"Siobhan is an incredible host - the home is beautiful and spotless; our room was filled with thoughtful touches such as an electric bed warmer, a jug of water & glasses, an incredibly detailed binder full of suggestions for local food & entertainment, and more.  

Siobhan herself is extremely welcoming and was happy to chat or provide helpful advice to make the most of our trip. I can't recommend this airbnb enough!"

The welcome was really good and she gave us a lot of information about Dublin and public transport. The house is really nice and the location is very good! There are bus and Luas stops at 1 minute walking. But the best is... Siobhan... Nice, kind and very helpful... We enjoyed lovely conversations with her! She gave us lot of recommendations and information. We love her dog... Rudy!!! Definetely it was a pleasure!"
6659169,452557882,5/13/2019,"Siobhan's home was perfect for my visit to Dublin. Great location, close enough to the city centre to walk or take the tram a 2 min.walk. it was a very quiet street. Siobham's home was also very tastefully decorated and relaxing.  Siobhan's breakfasts were wonderful especially her homemade granola. Siobhan gave great tips for places to see that fit my intetests.  Good value for the price."

6659169,463384373,6/3/2019,"I felt so welcomed at Siobhans home in Dublin! It was a wonderful to start the day with a breakfast in a cozy kitchen overlooking a garden. The neighborhood is close to Dublin city center and Phoenix Park.  I walked or took the bus or tram into town and into its surrounding neighborhoods. The bus and tram are extremely close by and convenient. The nearby Stoneybrook neighborhood had some great pubs and restaurants. 

Siobhan was very helpful in helping me figure out my best approach to navigating my way to various places. After spending time in some  Airbnbs with absentee hosts it was a pleasant experience to interact with a friendly and helpful host. I left feeling as if I had a new friend in Dublin."
6659169,467300175,6/10/2019,Siobhan is an amazing host! So helpful and friendly. She provided so much local information. I took a day trip to the Cliffs of Moher leaving very early and she provided my breakfast even though I left before the usual breakfast time. Rudy helped me not miss my doggies back home. My trip was made better by staying with Siobhan and if I'm fortunate enough to return I'll definitely stay with her again!

She is a truly lovely lady and we felt at home as soon as we arrived.  Rudy welcomed us also and is a beautiful friendly dog.  The little extras Siobhan provided added such a thoughtful touch such as fresh water and glasses in the bedroom and little chocolates - the bedroom was very comfortable and spacious and even had an electric blanket if you needed it.  Delicious fresh home-made granola for breakfast and fresh orange juice and croissant, berries and yogurt  each morning.  The location is perfect for the Luas and buses and nearby eateries.  Really enjoyed our chats with Siobhan who is so knowledgeable and she gave us excellent advice on anything we asked. We will miss this little home from home but we will definitely be back again."
6659169,474556895,6/23/2019,"We spent just two nights at Siobhans but managed to see and do a lot in Dublin thanks partly to her great recommendations and good advice. She even made good suggestions for other places we plan to visit in Ireland. Our room was quiet, comfortable and private. Lovely fresh flowers in the room and general areas were a nice touch as were the robe and slippers. Siobhan will be there for you but will also respect your privacy.  We enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts. Siobhan is a wonderful and caring hostess and we left feeling we have a new friend. 

We were pleasantly surprised about how easy and fast it is to travel to and from  other parts of town, including the airport, using public transportation and the Leap Card recommended by Siobhan makes it very affordable.

The accommodation is as described and I highly recommend it."

6659169,487781806,7/14/2019,"Siobhans home really feels like a home away from homeù, much thanks to Siobhans care of the house and the guests. Siobhan makes sure to prepare breakfast every morning! Everything is sparkling clean and the room was so comfortable. Rudy is such a nice dog, he keeps to himself most of the time, and I really enjoyed when he came say hi in his shy way. I also loved all the green you see outside the windows and the traditional blue door :) The neighborhood has new cafes and bars mixed in with a traditional residential neighborhood and I really liked that. I like walking all over and managed to walk everywhere from Phibsborough - there are also tram and bus stops just around the corner. Siobhan has many local tips ready for you and her communication is outstanding. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!"
6659169,513996641,8/20/2019,"A quiet and comfortable home, conveniently close to the LUAS tram into town. Siobhan was helpful guiding us as new comers to Dublin. Local shops and eateries were close and convenient."

6659169,533859693,9/22/2019,"Great place near Phoenix park in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of small restaurants and grocery store near the house. You are a bit off center which is good if you prefer to be out of the crazy downtown vibe, but the house is two steps from the tram and you can easily reach the center of the city in a half-hour walk. Siobhan house is well decorated and very quiet. It was also nice to be able to have a cup of tea in the evening with her and however is also staying in the second room. And let's forget Rudy who is such an adorable and friendly dog !"
6659169,535334014,9/24/2019,"Probably one of the best  share ABB experiences I've ever had. (I usually stay in whole apt. places ). Siobhan's house was wonderful and comfortable in all the right ways. The place is lovely, warm and very clean, nicely decorated everywhere etc. Siobhan put a lot of attention into great details like morning granola, toiletries and evening chocolates. She is an amazing, very positive hostess and was highly accomodating as well -- this was important because flooding delayed my arrival and I was trying to get over being really unpleasantly sick. Room was great and really comfy bed-- I was next to a room with a couple but didn't really hear them even once. 

The location in Phibsborough is lovely too-- right across from the tram and an easy ride to the airport. Would gladly stay here again when I get back to Dublin."
6659169,537208295,9/28/2019,"We stayed in Siobhan's house for 3 nights and it's absolutely perfect. The room is spotlessly clean and the bed is so comfortable that we didn't want to get up every morning. The location is very convenient and easily accessible to city centre by tram. Siobhan is very hospitable that she has prepared us breakfast every morning and she provided everything we need. She also gave us lots of useful info prior to our arrival. If you want to stay in a local neighborhood and not too far from city centre, Siobhan's house is definitely a good choice."
6659169,540373649,10/3/2019,"It was a pleasure spending time in Siobhan home, the bedroom and facilities were perfect, with breakfast available every morning.

6677566,515097680,8/22/2019,"This place is perfectly clean and would suit most traveler's needs wonderfully. I wish I'd realized the laundry situation sooner--I'd have packed more clothes. There were LOTS of maps and things available in the room for finding one's way around, which we found helpful. The bed isn't horribly uncomfortable, but it also isn't horribly comfortable. I tend to have back problems, but it wasn't so bad as to aggravate that. Overall, given the chance, we'd go here again on a return trip to Dublin."

The neighborhood: Is near to the city center, near to buses, Luas and near to the Air Coach stop. Also you have some supermarkets around the house, and nice pubs.  Ranelagh is a quiet place with beautiful houses and nice and kind neighbors, one of the best areas to live in Dublin.

6677678,560644653,11/7/2019,"This might have been my favorite Airbnb yet! I had a nice studio to myself, yet Eamon was just a phone call/text away if I needed anything. He gave suggestions and tips for exploring Dublin, and even let me know when I could park a rental car in the area without having to pay. He also provided coffee, tea, and basic kitchen supplies. And best part, the place is dog friendly! Theres not another dog friendly option in such an ideal location in this price range."

Donnybrook is a really nice neighbourhood, the bus stop (airport bus and city lines) is just a 3-min-walk away. It takes about 30 min from/to the airport and about 15 min to get to the city center (if you want to buy a ticket, make sure you have enough coins on you as they don't give back change on the bus! we bought a 72-h-ticket at the tourist-info in the city center, so we could use all lines. the ""air coach""/airport bus is not included!)
Mary spoiled us with the best breakfast: coffee/tea, cereals, toast, butter, jam, fruits, orange juice - it was the perfect start into the day!
The room was super clean and very cosy, it felt like ""coming home"" every single day. Mary also provides towels, different kinds of shampoos/shower gel...there is also a tv, books, (Website hidden by Airbnb) many lovely details that make you feel comfy :)"
6680983,424191088,3/16/2019,Great place to stay if you want to be out of the city. Free parking at the house or a bus stop within close proximity as described. Room set up was perfect and Mary could not have been more lovely! Definitely would recommend to others.
6680983,429595861,3/28/2019,"Mary is unbelievably kind, and even upon checking in, we instantly felt welcomed, and comfortable! The room is perfect for my boyfriend and I, and incredibly clean. Marys breakfast spreads every morning were absolutely incredible. If you are looking to stay just outside all the busyness of the city, Marys is perfect for you!!"
6680983,431986858,4/2/2019,"I was at Mary's house for three days and everything was nice. The house is very clean and tidy. The breakfast is delicious.
Mary is a very warm and attentive host.
Recommended!"
6680983,434037784,4/7/2019,"We had a lovely stay at Mary's place. She is a geniunly kind and generous host, it was a true pleasure meeting her! The house was gorgeous and spotless, located about 20mins from the city center by bus. The location is really convinient, especialy for those catching an early flight, since it is less than 5mins away from an Aircoach buss stop which drives to the airport during the night."
6680983,436176809,4/12/2019,Excellent stay at Marys house. Mary is a very welcoming and thoughtful host and very helpful. We enjoyed the amenities at the house and had a great time! Highly recommended.
6680983,443203285,4/25/2019,"Highly recommend this location for Dublin especially if you do not want to be in the middle of all the craziness of the city center. Marys home is beautiful, peaceful, warm and welcoming. 

Mary was an excellent host. She was very quick to reply and also gave us great local tips of things to do. 

The accommodations were exactly as pictured and described. For my husband and I, this was exactly what we were looking for and excellent value. Mary provides breakfast each morning in her beautiful kitchen - a treat!

Regarding proximity to Dublin City Center, the bus is a five minute walk from Marys house. If youre going to take the bus, we recommend buying a leap card in advance. We also rented a car and it took 10-15 minutes drive depending on where we were going. Its very convenient and I liked that we escaped the noise of the city and had peace and quiet in the suburbs without sacrificing much in the way of convenience. 

Overall, a great find and well worth it for many reasons!"
6680983,446327009,5/1/2019,"Mrs Mary was a kind and gracious host. She exceeded our expectations in every way. She prepared fruit salad beforehand, - a thing unheard of from any other airbnb host. The bed linen smelled freshly laundered which is a heavenly smell in itself. The bedroom was properly heated which was a great relief. We didn't expect that at all, since previous hosts in Dublin didn't do this. If there's one thing, I'd have to nitpick 
it's that we'd have felt better being able to lock the bedroom from the inside. 

All in all though, a wonderful experience; Mrs Mary deserves her superhost status!"
6680983,448430297,5/5/2019,Perfect host and superb accommodation.
6680983,450734657,5/10/2019,"Above my highest expectation. Mary is an amazing host with cozy and lovely house. Place is amazing, sparkly clean and location is really great. I can only reccomed, 6 stars out of 5"
6680983,460832168,5/30/2019,"Mary's place is just awesome.  The room is large, the house is beautiful and the hospitality offered by Mary was incredible.  Excellent breakfast and a perfect stay!  I highly recommend this place."
6680983,462820161,6/2/2019,We stayed in Mary's place during a conference at UCD. It is well situated near the UCD campus and public transport. From here it is easy to venture out to do all sorts of things in Dublin. I have stayed in quite a few AirBnB locations and Mary's breakfast is truly fantastic. It will leave you with plenty of energy to get things done.
6680983,464244524,6/5/2019,"Mary and Seamus are very welcoming, easy to talk to and super friendly. This made our stay at their beautiful home even better. 
The room is on the 2nd floor and has everything you wish for. The bed is big and comfy. 
For breakfast we had the kitchen for ourselfs until 10am. There was plenty to choose from: toast, eggs, a bowl of various fresh fruits, yoghurt, juice, cerals, tea, coffee.
The area is perfect for exploring Dublin via bus or getting quickly to Wicklow Mountain National Park and its surroundings. It has been a great stay at Mary's and Seamus' place and we can absolutely recomment this accomodation."
6680983,467511942,6/10/2019,It was super nice.
6680983,471260860,6/17/2019,"Mary was a fantastic hostess. She provided us with a beautiful breakfast each morning.

6680983,472258024,6/19/2019,"Amazing place! My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Mary's place. It is in a great location. It is quiet and clear, and very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again in my next visit to Dublin."

6680983,478104731,6/29/2019,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Mary for 2 nights.  Everything was as it is shown and described.  Had a great dinner just down the road at the Merion Inn which Mary recommended.  Was easy to leave our car and get the bus into Dublin for the day for 3 euros each.
6680983,479649695,7/1/2019,"Me and my boyfriend only stayed for two nights before moving on to other parts of Ireland. Mary gave us a very warm welcome and made sure we had everything we needed. She also recommended a nice place for dinner since we only arrived and didn't know where to go. We had a lot going on in that short time but it was super easy to coordinate and communicate with her. A real carefree and comfortable experience, thanks so much!"
6680983,483339346,7/7/2019,"We had a wonderful stay. Mary's house is gorgeous, comfortable, quiet and very clean. Location is also excellent. Mary is a lovely host.

.."
6680983,486796128,7/13/2019,First time we have used airb&b and what a start. Mary set the bar very high in all aspects great choice for Dublin.  Bus at the top of the road.
6680983,504269741,8/7/2019,"Pretty nice and a warmly hosted BnB!

Everything was as it is described. We had our own room with a bathroom and toilet ensuit and a second room for living including a small frisch, a microwave as also a couch in front of a TV.  Everything is clean.
In the morning Mary has always prepared the table for breakfast. You can choose from a selection of cereals, have toast with different creams or marmelade,  boil yourself an egg and also have a selection of fruits. 

The towncenter of Dublin is between 45 and 60 minutes away from the BnB, but there is a busstation 5 minutes away. There also stops a bus line that drives to and from the airport 24 hours a day. Close to the BnB is an italian restaurant and a Pub. Both have good food and drinks.

Mary herself is very friendly and communicativ. She tries to help whenever she is asked."
6680983,516504343,8/24/2019,Fabulous place

6680983,566386776,11/19/2019,"Stylish, spacious place - both the bedroom and your own living room as well as the whole house. Sparking cleanliness everywhere. Neighborhood indeed one of the best in Dublin.  Buses around the corner, local rail ~12 min walk. Mary kindly offered tea and cake upon arrival. Tons of important tiny details everywhere (bottles of water, tea, coffee, snacks, TVs both in bed- and living room, sweets, heating on when necessary etc.)."
6681883,418540137,3/2/2019,"Schone kamer, op loopafstand van het centrum op een rustige plek, vriendelijk relaxte host"
6681883,424865242,3/17/2019,Ian is a very friendly host who strives to make your stay as comfortable as possible. He answers very quickly to questions of any kind. His house with the room for up to two people is functional and clean. It is due to its location ideal for a visit to Dublin.
6681883,426522637,3/21/2019,"Really good place to stay. The bedroom is way better than the pictures, it has heating inside and the bed its pretty big. We didnt saw Ian that much becouse of work and the comunication was perfect. By walking is like 25 minutes from the center or taking the 16 bus 2 blocks from the airbnb you can get in a few minutes."
6681883,435710645,4/11/2019,Perfect if you are looking for a basic place with a comfy bed and warm shower!
6681883,439613941,4/19/2019,A great place to stay in Dublin.

6681883,459431105,5/27/2019,"Good location, quiet area, walking distance to the city center but also bus stops are very near. Room is more spacious than it seems on the pictures. We've seen Ian only once but the whole stay was very straight forward and pleasant."
6681883,470359659,6/16/2019,"The place is inside a quiet neighborhood, around 15-20 minutes walking distance from the city center and the river.
The room is more spacious than it seems on the pictures, the bathroom was clean, and all fits very well for a 3 day-stay in Dublin.
We've seen Ian only once but the accommodation was nice."
6681883,475490218,6/24/2019,"Very good localizarion, close to the city center (20min walking) and the bus stop for the airport. The place is very quiet and confortable. Ian was very helpful, providing all the information."
6681883,485775715,7/11/2019,Simple but spacious room with a gentle host. Good facilities. Extra safe house behind a fence. Public transport nearby.
6681883,535441198,9/24/2019,Ian was an excellent host. Communication was very good. He answered all of my questions. Mobile phone or messages were no problem. The location is the best advantage. Very close to the city centre by bus or 15 minutes by walking. Direct public transport from  the airport to the house by bus number 16 or 41 takes just 30 minutes. There is also an Tesco expres close by.
6681883,539950061,10/2/2019,"Nice, clean place.  Ian was very helpful"
6681883,542416416,10/6/2019,"Great stay! Ian is a very available and easy going person.

6681883,548360471,10/17/2019,"The bedroom downstairs was more than suitable for our short stay in Dublin. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very warm which was nice when we got home as it was cold during our trip to Dublin. Towels, hairdryer etc were provided which saved us having to carry these bulky travel items. The bathroom was also clean and tidy. The flat was located about a 20-30 min walk into the city centre, and there were many local cafes etc very close by the flat. The bus 16 from the airport dropped us off very close, like a 10 min walk or so, from the flat, and it was easy to get back to the airport too from there. Good value for the space and location, would recommend to others."
6681883,555985627,10/28/2019,"Very nice place to stay, Luas stop at a little walking distance (10min) and a Tesco nearby. The room was very clean and spacious."
6681883,562082672,11/10/2019,"Ian could not have been a better host! He was friendly, fun to talk to, and has good taste in music! The room itself was really clean and in a great location that was only a short walk to the city center. We 100% recommend staying here and hope to come back if we are ever in Dublin again. Best AirBNB ever!"

6685082,450383717,5/9/2019,"You can expect a warm and homelike atmosphere. Betty is a charming and very helpful host. She can offer you plenty of advice and information on local attractions and she goes out of her ways to make your stay enjoyable and comfortable. She also has a great sense of humour. Also, you will find plenty of places to eat at the Applewood Village only 5 mins away. The bus stop into Sword is only another 5 mins. Swords will provide you with more pubs and restaurants, some of which are historic. Pretty well most of them are delights. There is also a  very modern shopping mall called the Pavilion where you will find everything you need or want. An express bus trip into Dublin is also available at the same bus stop near her place."
6685082,453275478,5/15/2019,Great hospitality and very accommodating. Perfect for a quick crash before heading to the airport.
6685082,454068364,5/17/2019,Betty is very kind and helpful! We loved her hospitality and her very lovely home. Would definitely recommend this home!
6685082,454504287,5/18/2019,"This comment is NOT linked to the property itself, we never had the chance to go there.

We booked a room for 3 people, and Betty contacted us few hours before the arrival to say that she only had 2 spaces available. 

We kindly asked her to cancel in order to find another room, she declined saying that we have to do it. 

This is a false information, in that situation SHE cannot welcome is so SHE has to cancel, otherwise we are the faulty one. 

We had to call the support in order to get some help. 

Would not recommend, based on our exchange with Betty. 

many thanks to AirB&B for helping us finding another roomù"
6685082,455832103,5/20/2019,"Beautiful house in a residential area, quiet and very clean .. Betty, the hostess, is very kind and helpful .. we also had the breakfast that we prepared in the spacious kitchen.

I really recomend this place if you are planning to stay in Dublin."

The neighborhood has nice breakfast places. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

6710681,489799605,7/17/2019,As so many have stated before Noel and Fidelma go above and beyond as hosts.  The apartment is so well positioned in Dublin for easy walking to many places in Dublin.  You can't go wrong staying here.
6710681,491462335,7/20/2019,"The location for the price is excellent, we were able to walk to Trinity College and several other sights within 20 minutes.  There is a bus line which takes you directly to/from the airport and has a stop out front.

Noel is a very helpful and accommodating host, he took the time to ensure we were settled initially and even offered the use of his personal washer when I had a large amount of family laundry to wash.  The apartment comfortably sleeps 4 adults and our teenagers really liked the sunroom area with twin beds as their semi-private space.  We were able to prepare simple meals and the wifi was very good.

This is a garden apartment, so there are steps out front up to the street.  Some simple maintenance could make these steps easier to navigate and the front door needs a higher doorknob (the keyhole is low and pulling the key in it is the only way to shut this door).  The ceilings are low in the laundry/bath area and it feels a bit damp as many below-ground spaces are."
6710681,497125213,7/28/2019,"We had a pleasant stay with Noel. The place is like expected, located at a residential area, and very easy to access the city center (we always take the walk, but a bus stop is 15 m away from our door). We arrived very late, but the check in process was very smooth. We had some food in the fridge :-) Great for the breakfast of the following day. Very responsive and allow us to have a very appreciated late check out. Looking forward to return to a vibrant city as Dublin"
6710681,508181202,8/12/2019,"Fantastic place. Ideal position: easy to walk to loads of attractions, great bars and restaurants nearby, private parking. Welcoming host and great facilities, even welding gin and tonic"
6711103,435107784,4/9/2019,"Deidre and her husband were incredibly welcoming. Their home felt warm and welcoming, with breakfast in the morning and plenty of interesting stories to hear. They gave great tips for the local area, which my friend and I enjoyed more than Dublin. Plus, with the train a mere walk away, Dublin was close at hand and cheap to get to and from.

Deidre and her husband went above and beyond in every way, no question about it. This was by far the most amazing, friendliest place that I have ever stayed in, and no hotel or hostel could ever be worth the difference in savings. I fully plan to come visit and see the area again!

Thank you so much Deidre, for the best stay!"
6711103,445506875,4/29/2019,"We had an amazingt time at Deirdre's and Kevin's beautiful home and would love to visit again in the future.
If you are looking for a quiet place to relax near to the sea, but still want to be close to Dublin this is your place.
Deirdre and Kevin were super accommodating and kind hosts, we need to mention that Deirdre is a passionate gardener so in the kitchen you can always find something fresh from her garden, and also her jams are amazing.
We couldn't wish better hosts, we had everything we could have need and more.
Thank you for everything ‚ô°"
6711103,447944860,5/4/2019,"Deirdre and Kevin are wonderful hosts, who made us feel welcome as soon as we stepped into the house. Their homemade breakfast was amazing and we had a great time chatting with them every morning!!! They gave us great tips for exploring Ireland. Deirdre even gave me a tour of her garden when I told her my interest in urban farming. I highly recommend staying with her if you want a true bnb experience in a cute little town in Ireland! I would definitely stay here again if Im ever back. (:"
6711103,454504825,5/18/2019,Place was amazing and the hosts were really nice and welcoming. Very lovely place to stay.
6711103,457582604,5/24/2019,Deirdre and her husband Kevin were wonderful people to stay with! They were very knowledgeable and really aided us in experiencing the best about Ireland. The fresh orange juice and hen eggs were delicious! You really are received so welcomingly and made to feel right at home. Skerries is a cute little sea town that is a joy to stay in. Highly recommend getting to know these two lovely people.
6711103,465209546,6/7/2019,"Very nice place, a lovely house with more than adorable hosts. A beautiful meeting that we will not forget. Thank you Deidre and Kevin. You give a very beautiful image of Ireland and Irish! Vincent and Stephanie (with an accent ... )"
6711103,531838683,9/18/2019,"Our second stay at Deirdre and Kevin's house. A stay feels a little bit like coming home.
We will come back at the end of next week at the ending of our holidays"
6711103,548247124,10/17/2019,"Dierdre and her husband Kevin were an absolute joy to stay with.  Their home is cozy and inviting.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and amazing conversation accompanied each mornings breakfast.  The town is walkable from their home, as well as the train to Dublin.  They were so helpful to me in giving advice for restaurants, using the rail system and I even attended a local play with them!!  I would recommend their home to anyone who wants the comforts of home while visiting the Dublin area‚ù§Ô∏è"
6719721,421384548,3/9/2019,"This apartment is in the perfect location if you are looking to visit the Guinness Storehouse!! It is about a 20 - 25 minute walk to the Temple Bar Area. A bit of a walk, but it includes many great sites along the way that makes it worthwhile. The host was very helpful and quick with responses when we had difficulties!"
6719721,425530376,3/18/2019,"AWFUL!  BEWARE!  My husband and I walked in, looked at each other and walked out (that's how bad it was).  We were fortunate that we were able to find a room at a hotel that evening.  After all, we were in Dublin, on St. Patrick's Day!!  My husband and I planned a trip to Ireland and had a layover in Dublin, coincidentally on St. Patrick's day.  All hotels were booked, so I took to Airbnb.  I found Christian's listing and reluctantly booked.  I read prior reviews, and in fairness, all were not great but come to find out TRUE! The walls, floors and windows were filthy, the bed felt like a concrete slab and it had a felt like we were in a youth hostel which is fine but not for the price we were paying.   All that aside, Christian  quadrupled the price because it was St. Patrick's Day.....not cool, not kind!  When I reached out to Christian he was non-apologetic and condescending. I reached out to Airbnb and had little success because I did not take photos (lesson learned).    Safe travels..."
6719721,437888532,4/15/2019,"This a centrally located flat, bus stop is right outside the door. It was warm and had ample hot water. Please note that breakfast is not included but there is a quick mart close by. We had a great stay in Dublin!"

6719721,456301930,5/21/2019,"Christian's place is in good location, close to the temple bar area, and the Guinness factory. The apartment was clean, easy to access, and he let us drop our luggage off a few hours before check in, which was very convenient. This is a great place for the price."

6719721,481623650,7/5/2019,"The place is comfortable and convenient. All the amenities youd want (coffee, laundry, good shower, quiet, hair dryer, etc.), in a good location. Its definitely used just for Airbnb rather than being someones home, if youre cool with that. 

Quicker communication wouldve been nice."
6719721,493863730,7/23/2019,"Great place for us to rest on our first night in Dublin. We were able to walk to the Guinness Storehouse in less than 10 min. There are a few flights of stairs so might be something to consider. My mother struggled, but the rest of us had no problem."
6719721,497048237,7/28/2019,The apartment had everything we needed for our mini break. The location was perfect and only a 10 minute bus journey into Temple Bar area.

6719721,522579909,9/2/2019,"Down the st from the Guiness Facotry and walking distance to all major sites.  Also conveniently located blocks from train station. Communication was amazing, helpful hints. Can't ask for more a real pleasure."
6719721,525155875,9/7/2019,"Christian's place is a wonderful little flat tucked away, but very close to everything! You're only a 5 min walk away from the Guinness Storehouse, as well as other breweries/distilleries. You're about a 10 min walk away from Temple Bar and other beautiful places to eat and drink. It was a lovely stay, and Christian was very helpful in giving us tips of what to do and where to eat. Thanks so much!"

Unfortunately I was not able to meet Ciara in person as she was not in Dublin over the weekend, but she was an amazing help. She went out of her way to return something to me that I forgot at her place, and was always very lovely while communicating. 
Definitely recommend staying with her to explore Dublin. I would definitely do it again! :)"

6743129,424933671,3/17/2019,Staying with Arlene was amazing! She was a phenomenal communicator from the start and very responsive to all of our questions. When she found out our flight was getting in at 6AM she allowed up to check in early at 8! Her home had so much charm and was steps away from the DART. She gave us great recommendations for places to visit. Her breakfasts were amazing and we felt like we were at home the entire time. Thank you for everything Arlene!!

Close to an Eurospar so you will have easy axcess to all your ¬´must haves¬ª. 
Catherine is a great host! She came to give us the keys when we arrived and gave us a lot of good advice on what to do (and what not to do). 
Through our weekend there she answered our questions quickly through the chat function.

Would recommend!"
6763724,502953470,8/5/2019,"The flat is larger than the pictures portray, is stylishly updated with everything one would need for a short or long stay, sparkling clean,  I slept very well in the comfortable bed, there is plenty of storage for clothes, the bathroom is modern with hot water on demand...I could go on and on about how lovely the flat is but I'd only repeat what has been written by others. On top of all of that, Catherine is a great host as well. I hope to return for a much longer stay next summer!"
6763724,513981164,8/20/2019,"Great location, comfortable space, everything you need!!!"
6763724,521025040,8/31/2019,Catherine's listing looks just like the pics and she is a wonderful host.
6763724,538864139,9/30/2019,"Catherine was very easy to communicate with at all times.  She was very accommodating with my arrival plans, for which I am grateful.  The apartment is truly lovely with all the amenities one could want and more, with a fireplace and a dryer!  Plenty of sunlight and lots of room to move about comfortably.  I stayed a month and it felt like home.  The trendy location is just far enough from the busy touristy section, yet close enough to walk anywhere in the city.  Sandymount Beach is about a mile away and perfect for running endlessly along the shore.  There are various groceries close by and numerous coffee shops/bakeries. Catherine's suggestions for where to eat are spot on - Juniors is amazing for Sunday brunch.  Highly recommend the oatmeal at Gertrude's and avocado toast at Honey Truffle.  I never met the neighbors, but everyone was respectfully quiet.  Apt is in a highly secured/gated community, in front of the bus stop, and I always felt safe.  I was also able to join a gym for the month, about three blocks away.  The apt is stylish and soon became a home away from home.  A definite must-stay!"
6763724,543280178,10/7/2019,This was not just perfectly located for us but so pretty and clean - and a hand-written Card handed to us with the keys made us feel even more welcome. Loved every single second!
6763724,557475480,11/1/2019,"I had a lovely stay at Catherine's place - communication was great, check-in was straightforward and the place was clean and comfortable. Would recommend!"
6763724,561418339,11/9/2019,"Catherine is a truly wonderful host and provided warm comfortable surroundings, exactly as pictured. She is a very thoughtful and welcoming host.  The location is superb, with restaurants and a grocery nearby, recommendations from Catherine were welcome and excellent, thank you for a wonderful visit!  I look forward to staying here again!"
6765402,422015586,3/10/2019,"This listing is in a perfect location for a walk to my office or to hop on the DART to access Dalkey or Howth easily. It was clean, stylish and offered all the amenities one would need for a longer stay in Dublin. I will be back!"
6765402,425439930,3/18/2019,"This place was OUTSTANDING! My girlfriend and I care for St. Pattys day and has an amazing time. Great location, very clean, up to date amenities, and an outstanding host. I would recommend to travelers of all ages."
6765402,427861934,3/24/2019,This is my second stay at Catherines lovely cottage and it was as fabulous and perfect as my first visit. Cant recommend the place enough.
6765402,436034183,4/12/2019,Lovely stay! I keep coming back for work trips.
6765402,442829246,4/24/2019,"The cottage was bright, clean and modern. A lovely space. Location was very convenient. All of which made for a great trip. Thank you Catherine for being so accommodating. Cant wait to return!"
6765402,445489466,4/29/2019,"Catherine was an outstanding host, very accommodating and great communication. Recently renovated cottage was as described and very clean and comfortable. Docklands location was great - easy walk to city centre,  and taxis nearby if needed. DART rail station also close by. Good grocery stores, restaurants, shops and pubs in the neighbourhood. Some construction noise nearby during the day but not a problem for us. We were in Dublin for a short vacation and would stay here again."
6765402,447885712,5/4/2019,"The cottage is lovely, modern and full of light. It has been recently modernized with a lovely, functional kitchen and splendid bathroom. Catherine has provided everything one could possibly need during a week-long stay and offered helpful tips to surrounding restaurants and amenities. Our communication with Catherine was always efficient and effortless, as was the check-in process. Dublin is more compact than we realized and it is a short and pleasant walk to museums, pubs and galleries. We particularly enjoyed the walk from the cottage along the canal to the many excellent restaurants in Portobello and Rathmines."
6765402,450836908,5/10/2019,Catherines place is fantastic! Its super stylish and cozy and its in a great location. Catherine was a wonderful host. She was responsive and easy to communicate with. Ill definitely be back next time Im in town!
6765402,455870712,5/20/2019,The cottage is in a perfect location for exploring Dublin and the surroundings. Public transportation is easily accessible. Catherine is a wonderful host.
6765402,463948285,6/4/2019,"It's hard to put into words exactly what makes a hostess great, but Catherine is it. She responds very quickly and helpfully. She provides more than most ABnB hosts in terms of foodstuffs, toiletries, etc. The apartment is sparkling clean and SO lovely and comfortable. It is in fact so pleasant and peaceful inside that you may want to skip the sightseeing, etc, so you can sit in front of a cozy fire or out in the sunny courtyard instead. The apartment is also perfectly located though the construction outside may intrude from time to time. I don't have plans to return to Dublin anytime soon, but I may invent some so I can return to this terrific and elegant cottage."
6765402,469356194,6/14/2019,"Stunning cottage with all the updated touches...absolutely loved the fireplace and rainshower!! Excellent location to restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, public transport. 
Catherine is delightful and gives a thorough run down of the cottage upon arrival...she also has a wealth of local suggestions. Hope to return!"
6765402,471868863,6/18/2019,"Outstanding, beautiful , modern flat just outside of Dublins city center!  Just a short walk to downtown and all Dublin has to offer.  If not inclined to travel by foot, ground transportation, to include the train, is super close.   Catherine is an outstanding, responsive host, as well, and provided excellent recommendations for activities and dining.  We would love to stay again if we return to Ireland!"
6765402,473196439,6/21/2019,"I enjoyed staying at this stylish, comfortable home in a fantastic, convenient location. The host is very welcoming and responsive. I'd enjoy staying here again."
6765402,483034416,7/7/2019,"Cottage is clean, modern, and within walking distance of major sights.   Also near public transportation for easily getting around the city and beyond .   Catherine is a great host and really goes above and beyond to accommodate needs for your stay."
6765402,485141704,7/10/2019,This is a fantastic place to stay. Very stylish and extremely well appointed. Convenient to the centre of town.

6765402,500487423,8/2/2019,"The cottage was immaculate and Catherine responded very quickly to all of my messages and was very informative. I can see why she is a SUPER HOST! We would definitely stay in her cottage again. It was convenient to City Center, but just far away from the hustle and bustle of downtown to have quiet relaxing evenings."
6765402,513853934,8/20/2019,Catherine was very helpful with answering questions about the area and I had no problem checking in or out. The washing machine worked perfectly and it was nice to relax in front of the fireplace. A store was but few steps away and there was nice restaurants not far off. I was happy with my stay.
6765402,517100832,8/25/2019,"Catherine is a lovely host. She was highly recommended to me by a friend who is a former employee of Airbnb and stayed at her place many times while traveling on business. Catherine made checking in and out so easy, and was super responsive along the way. The place itself is in a fabulous location, close to good restaurants (try Juniors - it's soooo tasty), markets, and transportation. It is very well decorated, super clean, and having the back garden is nice in the morning and evening when you want to have some fresh air come in while you're sitting with your glass of wine hanging out. The space is probably best suited for a couple or one individual, though I traveled with a friend and we didn't have an issue making it work. I have to travel to Dublin at least once a year and I definitely plan on coming back and staying at Catherine's place each time."
6765402,523364761,9/3/2019,"At Catherines you can expect a very cozy, comfortable apt with all the amenities, including an onsite washer/dryer!  You will be hosted by a warm, friendly attentive host!  You wont be disappointed!"
6765402,525827722,9/8/2019,"Very classy and stylish home, beautifully equipped. Expensive but in our opinion worth the money. Highly recommended."
6765402,539842245,10/2/2019,"Convenient, stylish space within a 1-minute walk of a coffee shop, grocery store and a few eating spots. The host was responsive, flexible, clear and warmly hospitable in communications. Excellent stay."
6765402,542341789,10/6/2019,"Catherines has an amazing place in a great location. She met me at the door for check-in, showed me around her home, and gave me some great tips on local places to visit. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Dublin to visit."
6765402,549330704,10/18/2019,Catherine was a good host. She accommodated my late check in and promptly responded to all my questions. Thank you!
6765402,556790398,10/30/2019,Amazing place in an amazing city.  Can't wait to be back!
6765402,561020583,11/8/2019,"Im sorry to leave my first negative AirBnB review/experience. I stayed for 8 nights and 9 days, 6 of which had no consistent hot water. I was traveling for work and very busy so 90% of my use of the flat was to shower and sleep. 

Catherine was extremely nice and communicative but I think she should have treated this as an urgent issue and did not trust me when I first brought it up. The cost of an emergency plumber visit would be a pittance compared to the ~$1500 I was spending. She refunded me only one night but I was basically taking sponge baths for 6-7 days when Im working 12 hour days and getting soaked in the rain, so that does not seem like fair recourse. All you want is a nice bed and hot shower after these long days so it was extremely frustrating and stressful to be missing one huge feature of a business stay."
6781323,497332147,7/28/2019,The hospitality was exceptional as the place and the breakfast. The fresh homemade scone was a plus in an already cosy and quiet environment. I will definitely get back if my path will cross Dublin again.
6781323,503026177,8/5/2019,"Elaine's space had everything and more that I could need as a solo traveler. Plenty of space (almost like a bachelor apartment), with options to properly cook in a private space if desired. She was incredibly helpful and considerate and I would definitely stay with her again!!"
6781323,508090486,8/12/2019,"This is the absolute perfect place for a lone traveler. Elaine goes above and beyond to help you out during your stay. I wish I could have spent more time enjoying the area, but I was so busy in Dublin. Everything you need is in both rooms - tea kettle, toaster, fridge, hair dryer, umbrella, etc. The place is immaculate and it is so nice to have the room with the tv to yourself. Shes a two minute walk from the bus stop and a 10-15 minute bus ride right to OConnell Street. If I ever find myself going back to Dublin on my own, I would book here again in a heartbeat."
6781323,511421053,8/17/2019,Elaine gave such a warm welcome and left a nice breakfast for me in the morning. Location is close to buses to that get you into the city center and the airport.
6781323,513874021,8/20/2019,Elaine was the best Airbnb host I have ever had. She was unbelievably and kind and made me feel like family. The room was absolutely perfect and the breakfast was delicious. I had a bathroom and living to myself which was more than I could have asked for. If I could give Elaine 10 stars I would. She made Ireland feel like home.
6781323,516351680,8/24/2019,"A very warm welcome awaits you, accompanied by invaluable tips, breakfast, a quiet neighborhood and very comfortable bed. Ideal for one traveller, easy to commute into Dublin city centre and get to/from the airport. Elaine is a wonderful host and will go out of her way to help you."
6781323,518334456,8/26/2019,I had a wonderful time at Elaines. The space provided was perfect starting point to explore Dublin. The amenities and extras made for a really pleasant experience. Easy to find and located in the north of Dublin close to the main bus routes.
6781323,524707685,9/6/2019,"Elaine is a fantastic host, very kind and thoughtful, and her room is the perfect spot to stay in as a lone traveller. Thoroughly recommended!"
6781323,525224657,9/7/2019,"The room was comfortable, warm and with everything you would want from a bnb. Breakfast was lovely."
6781323,527133960,9/10/2019,"Elaine is a wonderful person, she made me feel like home. The location is perfect ! Great neighborhood, very quiet. Only a 5mn walk from the bus station where you can go to the Airport or the centre! The place is amazing, very tidy! This is the perfect spot if you're a lone traveller, you won't regret it! I can only recommend this place and Elaine is fantastic!"
6781323,528509294,9/13/2019,"wonderful host,  great place,  excellent location - what more can you ask for?!"
6781323,538039112,9/29/2019,This place is lovely! Not too far from the centre of Dublin it was easy enough to get to. The room was immaculately clean and the little touches such as a breakfast kept in the fridge and a little note upon arrival made all the difference. Elaine gave me great directions to various sites on the day of my departure and even gave me a couple of food items so I wasnt going on my way hungry! Would definitely stay again!
6781323,539377375,10/1/2019,Elaine was a great host. I really enjoyed her local recommendations. I would definitely stay here again.
6781323,547552230,10/15/2019,"It was definitely my best experience with airbnb! I want to thank Elaine for such great hospitality, care, advices and my perfect stay in Dublin .) 
100 % recommended .)"
6781323,547941564,10/16/2019,"Elaines place is a perfect little studio with own entrance, little sitting room with TV, single bed and private shower/bath. While connected to the main house, you have your own space and are totally independent. Nice touches (homemade jam, berries , muesli and orange juice for  breakfast) and very good connections via bus into the city make it perfect for single  or work in Dublin."
6781323,550662790,10/19/2019,Wonderful spot for the lone traveller. Amazing hosts.
6781323,556422610,10/29/2019,"Elaine is a wonderful host. Nice, comfortable space for a lone traveler. You can walk to several restaurants and delightful pubs in about 15 minutes. Its a very cute area. Would stay again, no doubt."
6781323,558013517,11/2/2019,"I cannot say enough great things about Elaines place and her incredible hospitality. There were so many special little touches in the room (hair dryer, umbrella, maps of the city, usb wall plug, etc.) and the space was great! Its a quick walk to the nearest bus stop which is incredibly easy to navigate in Dublin. I didnt have any solid plans for my trip, but had a great time in my short stay because Elaine gave great tips for the city. The Botanical Gardens are just down the road and theyre beautiful, definitely check them out! I hope to stay here again! :)"
6781323,558747117,11/3/2019,Hospitality at its finest! Elaine was more than accommodating for my nights stay and the extra touch of a warm cup of tea on arrival with a scone was just lovely. Would definitely recommend to a friend as it is a safe and welcoming stay.
6781323,568266959,11/24/2019,"This stay is perfect for solo travelers! Elaine is an amazing host and was eager to give me tips and recommendations for what to do with my time in Dublin. The place has so many personal touches that made it above and beyond, such as a heated blanket, breakfast in the morning, and much more! It is a short bus ride to the center of the city, but it was very easy to navigate with Elaine's help. If you're looking for a cozy, quiet place to rest and warm up if you're traveling alone in Dublin, this is truly the perfect spot."
6782117,419113284,3/3/2019,great place to stay and great host.
6782117,420000763,3/5/2019,this place is amazing! super close to everything we wanted to see! Sabrina is an awesome host!
6782117,420951228,3/8/2019,"Sabrina's place is centrally located. It's within walking distance to a lot of attractions, shops and bars. It's clean and comfortable."
6782117,430902392,3/31/2019,A great host for a nice apartment in the heart of Dublin.
6782117,432522690,4/4/2019,"Great location near temple bar and within walking distance from Guinness and Jamison.  Although we were very disappointed in the cleanliness of the apartment.  Some of the pictures in the ad are not of this apt. The shower was filled with mold between the tiles, with a rug that is old and stained.  The couch has a big stain on it, and the walls are discolored and could use a wash or a new coat of paint.  Because of these areas it was hard to trust the cleanliness of the bedrooms.  We expected noise due to being in the heart of the city but it is much louder than expected throughout the night.  Sabrina was prompt at check in.  Although due to the lack of cleanliness we feel it was overpriced and would not stay here again.
PS.  Don't use the washer and dryer, it will shrink your clothing."
6782117,434073542,4/7/2019,Close to town centre and temple bar area. Great for mates for a long weekend away
6782117,435384296,4/10/2019,Dirty and a very noisy location.  May be OK for college kids but for a family I would not recommend this place at all.
6782117,435762169,4/11/2019,"My friends and I ended up staying here in a pinch and Sabrina was very accommodating!  She met us late to go over the place and was very accommodating.  The place itself was clean, spacious and had a cool vibe.  As busy as the street is below, none of the noise slipped in and we slept great.  The location cant be beat, this is a great spot to stay for a night out in Dublin!"
6782117,440204500,4/20/2019,Comfortable apartment in the heartù of Dublin!
6782117,440750268,4/21/2019,"Great location right in the heart of Dublin. Everything is within walking distance. There is some noise from the street, but we could sleep with the windows open just fine. Would definitely recommend it."
6782117,442431680,4/23/2019,"The location is really great,it was the best thing about the apartment."
6782117,443150399,4/25/2019,"The apartment is in a central location but the area is a bit sketchy and loud.  Sabrina is quick to respond to messages, questions and concerns.  The apartment was in need of a good cleaning and new bed linens."
6782117,444149733,4/27/2019,"Sabrina was a great host. Her appartment is centrally located (temple bar, guiness brewery, greyhound racing in walking distance). Perfect place in a wonderful city!"
6782117,447908643,5/4/2019,The apartment was in a great location right across the river from temple bar area and many other attractions a short walk away. The building is older and across from a bar so there will be some street noise but it didnt bother us.
6782117,454469327,5/18/2019,"What needs to be said has already been said in previous reviews, but I will confirm that this place is well-located and the host is extremely kind and met us promptly with the keys.  Unfortunately I also have to confirm that this unit needs maintenance in terms of cleaning and furnishings (Mold in shower, thin and stained linens, needs paint due to excessive wear).  I am disappointed in value for money as I booked it far in advance, emphasized to he host that I expected it to be clean, and at the time of our stay saw similar well-located listings for a lower price."
6782117,456773740,5/22/2019,Fabulous location and great space! Would highly recommend. Very helpful hosts.
6782117,461382400,5/31/2019,"Great host, great apartment, great place to discover Dublin"
6782117,463353075,6/3/2019,Great central apartment with everything you need close by! Super smooth stay!
6782117,464360255,6/5/2019,"A very nice place to stay in Dublin. An easy walk to just about everywhere you would want to go. Not really in the main part of temple bar, but there are some nice pubs and a great shopping center nearby. The Japanese restaurant downstairs was great to have so close. Clean and as advertised. Sabrina also was very fast to communicate with answers to any questions we had."
6782117,465210499,6/7/2019,Location was awesome! Seemed like in the middle of everything but at the same not too close. Apartment was cute and clean and Sabrina was extra accommodating with our early flight. Their directions and hints were also extremely helpful! Would definitely recommend you stay here!
6782117,466410392,6/9/2019,"nice place, located right in the center."
6782117,468426589,6/12/2019,The apt is located in a great part of the city. You can walk to almost all the big sites and attractions within 30 min or easily catch a train/bus. The space was clean as well.
6782117,469355072,6/14/2019,"Sabrina was great and we appreciate she called a taxi to take us to the airport. 
Just one small issue, the heater did not work in the bedroom we stayed. 
The location was fantastic."
6782117,469816190,6/15/2019,This apartment is in a great location just off the Luas red line and close to Jervis shopping centre and lots of restaurants. Would highly recommend for its location and also it was a very clean and modern place to stay.
6782117,472268127,6/19/2019,"We had a great stay , the location was unbelievable, close to everything! Very friendly host and quick responses.. will definitely be back !"
6782117,473903464,6/22/2019,Good location. Apartment okay if only 4 guests and need 2 beds.
6782117,478955225,6/30/2019,"Sabrina is a lovely host, responds quickly and really does her best to accommodate her guests. The apartment is small but perfect as a base. The door into the apartment feels a little flimsy, would be nice if it had a better lock so guests could feel a little more secure. The apartment was very clean, the bathroom is a little dated but nothing some paint and TLC wouldn't fix. The front bedrooms looks out onto the main street and gets alot of the street noise (it's to be expected for where it is) but the back bedrooms is quiet!! Overall a great base in the heart of the city!! Would stay again! Thanks Sabrina"
6782117,479648170,7/1/2019,Amazing Location! Very near to the famous HaPenny Bridge and Temple Bar! Sabrina is amazing and very helpful. Highly recommended.
6782117,480310149,7/2/2019,"Lovely apartment overlooking the action, an amazing location. A few. minutes walking to temple bar area but far enough that it wasnt loud at night. Bedrooms are in back away from street which also helps. Definitely recommend!"
6782117,481787884,7/5/2019,Nice place in Dublin. Very close to Temple Bar.
6782117,483141640,7/7/2019,"Apartment was clean, exactly as described and in a perfect location. 5 minute walk to OConnell Street & just beside Hapenny Bridge. Slightly noisy at night and in the morning but nothing major. Great communication with the host. Would definitely stay again."
6782117,491584123,7/20/2019,"Good location, we stayed on a Fri and Sat night, wasnt that noisy as other guests described on reviews."
6782117,497157884,7/28/2019,"Fantastic location, very organised host with very useful tips of the area. Quick responses to messages and helps wherever they can."
6782117,498257820,7/29/2019,"Great location and spacious apartment! We only stayed for one night but it was easy to get to from the airport and was in a great location for exploring Dublin. The rooms were spacious, the kitchen has everything youd need and the building was secure."
6782117,500631228,8/2/2019,Perfect location and host!!
6782117,504107117,8/7/2019,"Sabrina gave us a warm welcome and showed us around the apartment. Communication and check-in was super easy! The apartment is in a great location close to public transportation and breakfast places. Very close to the inner city (everything in walking distance). Generally, the apartment is pretty noisy, from the street on one hand (which can be expected in a location like this), but also the building itself. The front door is very flimsy, it would really need a safer/stronger lock. But I guess that is not their fault as all doors in the building seem to be that way. We did not feel comfortable in the bathroom because many joints in the sink, the bathtub and the toilet were mouldy. This should be fixed soon. Also, one of the towels was dirty and also one of the pillow cases."
6782117,506364204,8/10/2019,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay! The apartment is in a great location, right next to the Temple Bar area, great restaurants, and awesome shops. The apartment was clean and the beds were comfortable. We were only here for 1 night, but would definitely stay again if we ever came back."
6782117,516485470,8/24/2019,Flat is in an excellent location which makes it easy to explore Dublin and use local transport links. Host was friendly and flat was comfortable to stay in. 10/10 would stay again!
6782117,521704442,9/1/2019,"Sabrina was fantastic at communicating and even let us drop our stuff off early. You could not get an apartment in a better location, it was so central to temple bar and so convenient for everything that we wanted to do. Apartment was clean but could do with a little updating/maintenance perhaps. However can't fault it due to the price and location. thanks so much Sabrina! would definitely recommend."
6782117,523373564,9/3/2019,"The apartment is in a great location, very close to Temple Bar and OConnell Street.  The apartment is as as advertised but shabbier than we were expecting.  The bathroom appeared to have been cleaned quickly, leaving trash and sink residue from the previous guest.  This left me with an uneasy feeling about the cleanliness of the rest of the apartment.  To confirm this feeing, there were multiple stains on the couch and it appeared the throw rug had not been vacuumed.  Maybe a good choice for those looking for close proximity to bars and nightlife and not so concerned about cleanliness."
6782117,525868173,9/8/2019,The apartment was in a brilliant centre location. Sabrina the host replied rapidly to all communication. Would recommend staying here.
6782117,530070509,9/15/2019,Good location.
6782117,531718637,9/18/2019,Great location and stay.  Thanks!

6782117,534866207,9/23/2019,"Our host was extremely responsive, and we had a good stay. The location can be very loud, but this is likely very common for the area."
6782117,535897772,9/25/2019,"great location, fun places to eat and shop within a few minutes of apartment"
6782117,536785482,9/27/2019,"Great location, great beds, shower and wifi, Sabrina was very availableto us."
6782117,539949892,10/2/2019,"The apartment is pratically in the center of Dublin just a couple minutes walking to Temple Bar.
The only problem was the heating in the rooms didn't work and it was a bit cold in Dublin at the time."
6782117,540834618,10/4/2019,Awesome location! Great host!
6782117,541564014,10/5/2019,"Centrally located, walk to the river Starbucks and O'Connell St"

Would highly recommend"
6782117,552341408,10/21/2019,Great family apartment. Great location.
6782117,552773945,10/22/2019,If you are looking to explore around Temple Bar area this is a great location. Easy access to all you are looking to do. A nice stroll over HaPenny Bridge to and from the Apartment gets you away from all the late night revelry of Temple Bar. Best of both worlds.
6782117,555830340,10/28/2019,"The host and location are brilliant - no complaints there. 
The property itself however is tired and feels dirty. We replaced bedding and towels for our 3 day stay there. 
If you are looking for somewhere to sleep after wild partying and dont care too much about feeling too fresh, then this place is great however if you plan to spend anytime in the communal areas or cooking for yourself then we wouldnt recommend it."
6782117,556371955,10/29/2019,The apartment is in a perfect location. Sabrina is a wonderful host.
6782117,560315430,11/6/2019,"Well located, very clean! The apt was perfect and Sabrina did everything good in order to host us confortly! Thanks again!
Florian and his friends"
6782117,562104924,11/10/2019,It's a great location. 10 mins away from everything and some great brunch places. The flat itself is a bit dated and could do with a good scrub. I reckon they're have been several stags/hens stay at this apartment hence the honest wear and tear. Great value for what you get and would recommend it for a quick weekend on a budget.
6782866,429908609,3/29/2019,"Very grateful to Victoria for the room she is renting. She is very kind, so contfortable bed, very quiet and peaceful place."
6782866,459318813,5/27/2019,This room is perfect if you want to explore Dublin. A tram stops nearby to take you to the city centre. The room itself was very clean and Victoria always was quick to respond. Overall a great experience.
6782866,495536309,7/26/2019,"Victoria's place is very well located if you're visiting the Sandyford area in Dublin. If you want to visit the city center you have a tram stop near by (7 min walk) that will take you to Dublin in 30 minutes. The room has all you need, even a kettle, and the on-suite bathroom is a great extra. The flat is very quiet so a good night sleep is guaranteed."
6782978,426236236,3/20/2019,Great place located outside of the city centre but everything is easily reachable. Very modern place and nice view.
6782978,434109379,4/7/2019,"Apartment was very clean and fully stocked with everything we needed. It was very quiet in the evenings, even had the window open for both nights due to it being quite warm. There are various coffee, food and various other stores all at the bottom of apartment block. Victoria was always very quick to reply with any queries we had. Would definitely recommend to others to stay"
6782978,450405520,5/9/2019,"Victorias place is perfect for my short stay in Dublin. Its clean and basically got every thing you may need. The location is very convenient, just less than 10 min walk to the closest LUAS station and only take you half an hour to the city centre. The place is highly recommended."
6782978,455223139,5/19/2019,"The house was very nice and has everything you need, also it is near the Luas. Victoria is very kind and tries to help you in anything"
6787500,488686359,7/15/2019,"Great house, very comfortable, easy access to all amenities in Dun Loaghaire, just a short walk to all the Yacht clubs."
6787500,511532726,8/17/2019,"This was our SECOND stay at this Beautiful home. Once again it exceeded our expectations in terms of location, comfort and managing check in and out. Jane and Damian treated us like family would and this only made the house feel more like home to my husband, myself and our two young boys. In terms of value, they say location is everything - and this is certainly the case with this home. Literally across the street from the Dart for a 15 mins ride into Dublin. At least 10 great restaurants within walking distance - Fish Shack, Cavistons, Hartleys, the cookbook cafe and our new favourite in Dun Laoghaire, Olivetos. Culture and History is all around you - James Joyce Museum - I got to hear a live reading of Ulysses, 40 foot and Dun Laoghaire pier. Another magical vacation and our home away from home played a huge part. Thank you!"
6789202,439632145,4/19/2019,"Host was very accommodating and her place is clean and sparkly. Quiet neighbourhood, good rest after a day of activities. Kitchen was well equipped for cooking as well. Place was well located, just 20 minutes away from the city by walking."
6789202,452873485,5/14/2019,Dee is a marvelous host and her flat is very conveniently placed and allows for an in depth exploration of Dublin on foot and by public transit. Dee was very responsive to the few minor hiccups we had during our stay. I would not hesitate to recommend her flat for anyone wanting to visit Dublin!
6789202,454401266,5/18/2019,"The place is in a great location downtown Dublin and walking distance to everything. Dee met us at the gate and showed us around. The apartment is a little small but probably common for a Dublin apartment. The apartment is in the ground floor so you hear and see people leave throughout the evening. The refrigerator was great although it froze everything. Dee had milk and cereal in the apartment which was nice. Overall, a good place for a couple people max."
6789202,458618793,5/26/2019,"Dee's place was perfect for a stay in Dublin, Ireland. After a long day of exploring Dublin, or any where in Ireland for that matter, it was a relief to come back to such a comforting place to relax and get ready for the next day. I would recommend Dee's place to anyone who wants to stay in Dublin."
6789202,462825770,6/2/2019,Comfortable apartment close to town centre
6789202,465700647,6/8/2019,"Dee's apartment is great! I loved the location (close enough to easily walk to all the attractions, but far enough from Temple Bar for peaceful, quiet evenings). She has so many recommendations for food and for places to shop and visit. Check-in and communication were great - Dee met me at the listing and walked me through everything. I highly recommend this apartment and Dee as a host!"
6789202,469844183,6/15/2019,"Dee's place was perfectly located in central Dublin. Within walking distance of almost all the main attractions. Dee was very helpful with check in, and offered some great tips on exploring the city! 5/5"
6789202,473340649,6/21/2019,"Dee was a fantastic host. She gave us many local tips that made the most of our time. The place itself was super cute, clean and you can walk everywhere from it. Would stay here again next time we get to Dublin :)"
6789202,479704945,7/1/2019,"If ever I am back in Dublin, I would check first if Dees place is available. Highly recommended."
6789202,485771287,7/11/2019,Quiet apartment complex. Nice walk along the river to the historic center. Dee was very nice and helpful.
6789202,510609499,8/16/2019,"Apartments located in nice area, very quite and safe. It was clean, had everything needed. Host was nice and friendly. Lived in this aparments during business trip for a week and can not complain about a thing"
6789202,516544762,8/24/2019,Excellent experience with our host Dee. Very prompt and helpful with her responses and recommendations on how to get about the city! The apartment is walking distance to the hustle and bustle of the city core and the Guiness Storehouse which was a big bonus if you enjoy long walks. Definitely a recommended spot for your next trip to Dublin! :)
6789202,520926604,8/31/2019,"its a good location, near Guinness, but about 1.5 miles to city center, which we walked to everyday for fun, or to catch a tour.  the place it self is small, perfect for a couple.  enough space to stretch out in the one bedroom and the one living room/kitchen.  we made our own breakfasts, there are stores all around for supplies like bread, eggs, peanut butter, milk, wines etc.   The bed is cozy and comfortable.  Dee supplies coffee and press.  
one bonus, its near the oldest bar, the Brazen head, which we stopped in every evening before heading home."
6789202,529034729,9/14/2019,"Dees apartment is great.The location is very nice,near the central of Dublin.The transportation is convenient."
6789202,534972130,9/23/2019,"Nice place, quiet for being so centrally located."
6789202,537306604,9/28/2019,"Dee was very responsive and the place was clean and had all of the necessities. The location was decent, 10min walk to Guinness and a 20min walk to the Temple Bar area. The bed was comfortable and the apartment complex was safe. My only complaints were that the breakfast cereals were stale and the milk was expired so dont count on breakfast as a cost savings, theres no TV for when you get back after a day of travel, and theres no parking so it did cost us 100Euro for the garage nearby for the week."
6789202,543255806,10/7/2019,Dee was a vey good host
6790352,421398721,3/9/2019,"Perfectly located and quite: near the spire (Dublin center) and grocery shops, restaurants, pubs,.. John did everything to suit my needs (keys, extended stay). I would recommend you this apartment for 3/4 people!!!"
6790352,459370572,5/27/2019,"I had booked the place for my mom and her friend who were visiting Dublin. Unfortunately the place is in much need of repairs and cleaning. 

The place is managed by a company and apparently has no involvement of the owner John

As soon as you entered the place, it smelt of damp/mold. There were damp/mold marks along the lower wall on the right in the entry passage and on the bedroom ceiling (I have pics which I will upload if I can or I can send them if anyone wants to see) . There was also a hole in the wall of the bedroom (also have a pic of that).

The freezer compartment of the refrigerator was encrusted with ice and not cleaned. Two of the stove hot plates did not work - this was however repaired on the second day.

The building was very well located; however the atmosphere within the building was not fresh. 
The host or his agent should have made at least one personal contact with us and helped us to settle down. There was no personal communication from anyone. 

Everything had to be done through the management website. 
I am so embarrassed for booking this place for my mom. Never again. Sorry Mom"
6790352,482421684,7/6/2019,Good location. Central. Good spacious room. Wifi included.
6790352,483082153,7/7/2019,"Great location, ideal for spending a few days in the city centre"

Amazing host super helpful"
6790352,519902797,8/29/2019,Older but very clean and spacious apartment right in the heart of Dublin. Excellent value.
6790352,531829340,9/18/2019,"Perfect location; short walk away from airport bus, trams, pubs and shops. Check-in and out very easy and John was great with communication. Highly recommend this apartment!"
6790352,532794134,9/20/2019,Great location and good little apartment!
6790352,536327178,9/26/2019,"Great location, quiet, and clean."
6790352,540351728,10/3/2019,"This place was a great place to stay.  Super clean, great location for touring around Dublin.   The host was responsive and flexible when I needed a change to my reservation.   You cant beat the price if you want to stay in the city.  I highly recommend this place."
6790352,544172469,10/9/2019,The unit was very well positioned for sight seeing clean and comfortable. The host was welcoming and easy to contact.
6790352,547906146,10/16/2019,Great communication with the host.  Very clean and the sofa bed was amazing (better than the regular bed!).
6790352,548339076,10/17/2019,"Johns place is a simple and clean apartment thats certainly well located in the Dublin city. However we had 4 guests in our group and we could only find beds for 3 guests (the sofa bed is a single). The double bed is fairly large so we ended up having 1 on the sofa and 3 in the double bed, so we managed but this is definitely something to be aware of! Overall I wouldnt recommend the apartment to groups of 4, but itd be just fine for a 3 or below :) 

John kindly allowed us to drop off our bags before check-in and was responsive to our messages throughout our stay. We also found a nice Italian restaurant nearby called The Italian Connection! 

Other than the bedding situation, the apartment has all the essentials: kitchen, bathroom, wifi etc. 

Can definitely recommend Johns place for smaller groups than ours!"
6790352,553526536,10/24/2019,"A nice place where to stay, near to most place of interest I will really recommended."
6790352,560883196,11/8/2019,"Broken heater, slow wifi and a very compact house.

6814536,434728089,4/8/2019,"Amanda was such a lovely host! Very sweet and gave us great tips for sites, food and drinks. She and her cute dog made us feel very welcome at her place. The apt has a good location and we were lucky that there was no noise coming from the bar below. The room wasnt big as you can tell from the pics but good enough. Usually, you dont spend much time in the room anyway when you travel."
6814536,452512042,5/13/2019,Amandas home is so nice! The area is great and a nice walk to Temple Bar. She was welcoming! I recommend staying with her!!

6814536,461881298,6/1/2019,"I stayed at Amanda's apartment for 2 nights on my first trip to Dublin. Amanda is a very warm and friendly host who gave me an excellent map and amazing tips on how to get around. She also allowed me to store my bags there for a few hours before my flight after check out. She has a very friendly dog and though I have allergies, I had no reaction the entire stay. 
The apartment is in the Liberty area next to many cafes and bars that are open late and the main street to the river. I walked everywhere for the most part and felt fairly safe at night. The apartment is very secure as there is a code and key to get through two exterior doors and a bolt lock on the apartment door. The Guinness Storehouse is literally 10 minutes, the Teeling Distillery is 15 minutes, and Temple Bar is 20 min walking from the apartment. 

The location is amazing and would definitely recommend staying here if you need a reasonably priced place to crash while exploring Dublin on foot."
6814536,466481294,6/9/2019,"Amanda was really nice, she gave me a warm welcome (with a little help from George). The position is great, just a 10 min walk from all the main attractions in the city centre. The room is nice and cozy as showned on the add."

6814536,528549028,9/13/2019,"The room was just what I needed. Very clean and good to see a no shoe policy.
Amanda was great.
The real star of the show is George of course. Give him a good scratch and you have a friend for life! I might just dognap him next time I'm there xD"
6814536,529878559,9/15/2019,Amandas home is great! 20 mins walk from city center. 10 mins walk from Guinness. The Bathroom is clean and bed is comfy. George is really cute lol

6816938,556694108,10/30/2019,"Marys home was just as described, and our oasis after busy, long days of sightseeing. Pay attention to her notes and instructions, especially with the tv remotes. :) Including manuals for the appliances was genius, as the slight differences from home could have made it very confusing without.

The home is beautiful, with lots of natural light, and in a cozy residential area. Plenty of room to spread out and get alone time, even with 4 people staying there. Youre far enough from the city centre to be able to relax, yet close enough to catch public transit or drive in. Also enjoyed the plants and flowers outside the home, beautiful garden. 

Even when just sending her a message that we had arrived and when we were heading out, she responded quickly and so kindly. 

¢ Wi-fi: fast and great in all spots of the house
¢ Shower - clean with good hot water 
¢ Bathrooms - having a toilet on both levels is a great help with 4 people staying there. 
¢ Kitchen: beautiful, clean, and with all the basics youd need to make a simple meal."
6817067,425862539,3/19/2019,"Arlene and her beautiful home was easily the highlight of our visit to Dublin, and that is saying a lot!  She was a warm and welcoming spirit after our long journey to the city and consistently was a joy to be around.  She immediately made us feel welcome in her home, which was clean, safe, and quiet.  Hope to stay with her again on our next visit to Dublin!"

6834535,427945415,3/24/2019,"Great apartment with an amazing location to explore Dublin. Right in the heart of Temple Bar.

Excellent experience and Garrett was very accommodating, flexible and gave us some good tips of where to eat and explore in the City. 

Would highly recommend this place to any traveller looking to explore Dublin and have s great base with a cracking riverside view of the Liffey and bustling Dublin nightlife.

Cheers!"
6834535,429593345,3/28/2019,"What a great location! Right in the heart of things, but just a couple blocks off of the center of Temple Bar to make it less noisy.  The views of the river, especially at sunset, were stunning.  We were visiting my daughter who is studying in Dublin and we comfortably fit five adults (four plus the night she stayed over).  Checking in was easy and Garrett was very responsive to questions.  I'd highly recommend this home as a great home base for seeing the sites in Dublin!"
6834535,435114084,4/9/2019,Loved everything about this place! Garrett met us and let us in and showed me where I could park. So nice and helpful. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable and nothing beats the views! I wish I could live there forever!!!

6834535,447916293,5/4/2019,This apartment is just as described.  Clean and plenty of space for 5 people. The location is perfect! Within walking distance to many tourist attractions. Communication was quick and easy with Garrett. We had a great stay and would definitely book here again if we get back to Dublin!
6834535,448446510,5/5/2019,We had a lot of delays and had to keep pushing back our check-in time. Garrett was totally fine with this and also helped us find the quickest route to the apartment. Highly recommend!
6834535,450114973,5/8/2019,Great location!!  Cant emphasize that enough. Host Garrett was easy to work with and his communication was very timely.
6834535,450752431,5/10/2019,"Simply charming. We booked this place for the view alone. Little did we know wed be about two blocks from all the fun Temple Bar has to offer. While visiting we got plenty of rain and Garretts place was the prefect retreat to cozy up with a cup of tea and enjoy the canal views. Garrett is a spectacular host and very responsive. With only two of us visiting we had more space than we needed with two bedrooms, it was delightful! We were traveling from the states and found this to be easy to navigate, comfortable, and a warm welcome to a beautiful city."
6834535,453291170,5/15/2019,"The views are every bit as good as the photos suggest, and the location is wonderful. As long as you're comfortable climbing two flights of stairs, this is a fine place to stay."
6834535,454504198,5/18/2019,"Great location, super helpful host!"
6834535,455792691,5/20/2019,This apartment is prime location and has the most amazing view. The pictures dont do it justice. Garrett was extremely helpful and we would definitely be back
6834535,456773403,5/22/2019,"Amazing location and great style.  The flat was clean and had great amenities, although we did have troubles with the hot water. The flat is well worn and dinged up."
6834535,460398719,5/29/2019,This was a great place to stay! Perfectly placed and close to everything!
6834535,470540390,6/16/2019,Great location & beautiful view of the the river.  It was  bit noisy our first night but that is to be expected near Temple Bar. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.
6834535,472793458,6/20/2019,"Excellent central location for touring Dublin.
For the price expected some updates and newer bedding."
6834535,475452290,6/24/2019,Perfect location. We walked to everything. Great view of river! Responsive host. Plumbing is a bit rustic but works. Rooms are small. High noise level from busy street below.
6834535,484024896,7/8/2019,"Garretts place in Dublin was a great place to stay. Location was excellent and it comfortably housed our party of four.  One of Garretts associates let us in during check in and was very helpful. We enjoyed our stay in Dublin, and Garretts place was a big part of that."
6834535,487842786,7/14/2019,Great apartment in a very convenient location with lots of lovely restaurants and bars within a very easy walking distance.
6834535,489255109,7/16/2019,Great place with a great location. Everything we were looking for and was in walking distance to just about anything. Beautiful view over the river.
6834535,507252525,8/11/2019,"You couldnt get a better location and place to stay while in Dublin. Garrett was more than helpful with any enquirys. The apartment itself was perfect for a weekend break, thank you!"
6834535,514437420,8/21/2019,Excellent view!
6834535,523284314,9/3/2019,Great apartment with an awesome view. Garrett was quick to respond to all questions. Location is in the heart of Dublin and we were able too walk everywhere. We would highly recommend.
6834535,531296857,9/17/2019,"Unloved apartment in need of refurb, but if you only want a doss house it is in a great location and just big enough for 4 people for a few nights. Also, the view over the Liffey is very good, but not unique!"
6834535,532276505,9/19/2019,Great location allowing you to easily come and go while enjoying all Dublin has to offer. As in most big cities there is a lot of drug use in area however the building itself is very secure. Recommend a walk to the harbour - lots to explore and do along the way. Place itself is dated but comfortable.
6834535,536759610,9/27/2019,"Garretts place is great! Location, amenities, communication with the host, everything was as advertised or better. We especially loved the location, just a few minutes walk from just about everything. A great spot and a great host!"
6834535,543779588,10/8/2019,"Overall, this place was pretty good. The location is the biggest perk however there were some downsides. Im going to be as honest as possible about Garretts apartment. 

First the good...
-The location of the apartment could not be better. You are close to all the action of Temple Bar but far enough away to not be too bothered by the crowds. You are within walking distance to so many bars, restaurants and shops! The view of the river is amazing! 
-Communication with Garrett was excellent. He was always quick to respond, very helpful, and even let us check in early.  The instructions he emails to you are the best Ive come across using Airbnb and I loved the detail! 
-the apartment had blow dryers and extra plug converters so the amenities were great in that aspect. It was also very spacious for a big city apartment. 

Now the not-so-good...
- I feel like the photos do not really match the true place. Yes, it looks the same to an extent but in person it definitely needs a little sprucing upî new linens, new paint, and definitely new pillows. They were so flat and uncomfortable.  The bedrooms just seemed pretty outdated. 
- The toilet/plumbing is very tricky and loud. Getting the toilet to flush on the first try became a joke with us- we were like Yes! I got it this time! The water tank is loud, especially if using the washing machine but it didnt really bother us. Just an FYI if you have kids sleeping, etc. 
- the washer/dryer unit is also tricky.  It took us forever to figure it out.  You have to run a wash cycle in order to dry. It doesnt just dry. You can set the settings for just dry but it will still start washing all over again lol 
- It seemed like the windows were always open in kitchen, even when they werent. The noise was loud from the street but once youre in the bedroom with the doors closed, you couldnt hear the noise so it did not bother us much. 
- neighbors have a young child so we tried to be as quiet as possible when coming and going, especially at night.  Despite our efforts unlocking the door and trying to close the door was not an easy feat lol. It sounds silly but the door handle is so small and its had to get it to close without slamming.  It became another thing we laughed about on a daily basis. Hopefully we didnt disturb the kiddo too much."
6834535,546135493,10/13/2019,Garrett takes great care of his place and will answer any questions you may have. Would recommend to friends!
6834535,550250832,10/18/2019,"Ok, this place is in a great location. The review by Denise from Wyandotte, MI in October 2019, said it best in her review, 100% accurate. This place needs updating big time. Theres a big problem with the plumbing, mostly the toilet. The shower was great, lots of hot water. Met the neighbor across the hallway, nice woman with child, we respected her wishes to be quiet after 9 pm. This place is a great cash cow for Garrett, his place is just what youll need to crash after a heavy weekend or night of partying the Temple Bar area. His place is 5 stars! I would stay here again,"
6834535,552320598,10/21/2019,"Perfect location for a stay in the city of Dublin! Restaurants, breakfast and bars very near. Wunderful view! And the Appartement very clean!"
6834535,557614305,11/1/2019,"We couldnt have asked for a better place for our honeymoon. Minutes walk away from almost everything you could possibly need. Shopping, food, drinking, tourist locations, romantic views of the river, located at the historical Isoldes Tower, this place has it all. Garrett was a responsive and extremely helpful host, with clear communication and instructions. Absolutely would stay again."
6834535,560983386,11/8/2019,"Great place for temple bar area.  Place is clean, not too loud, and overall great experience."
6839796,467274659,6/10/2019,"I spent a weekend at Arlene's lovely home. It was very clean, and the house is located in perhaps, the most beautiful area in Dublin."
6839796,470409138,6/16/2019,Arlene is a very nice and beautiful lady! The room is very cozy and comfortable!! A wonderful trip!
6839796,476492743,6/26/2019,"Arlene was a lovely host and provided a very homey, welcoming atmosphere.  My room was cute and cozy and the house itself was beautiful with lots of great artwork throughout.  Breakfast was provided and Arlene provides a great spread with a lot of variety. The location is a bit far out of Dublin, true, but the DART stop a couple blocks away made it very easy to get into the city and the quiet neighborhood and seaside accessibility made this the perfect spot for me to relax after spending the day tramping around downtown."
6850630,425852356,3/19/2019,"Staying in Len and Marks (and Ricky!) home was unlike any other¬†Airbnb experience I've had.

From the moment we booked, Len and Mark were quick to offer us help and tips about our upcoming stay. I knew from that point that I'd booked the right place.

When we arrived, they welcomed us like family. We shared coffee, chocolates and drinks while they gave us more information about Dublin and our stay in general. It's beyond words the generosity I felt at how they kindly and freely shared their time and knowledge with us. It was a pleasant way to arrive for our vacation. Over the rest of our trip we didn't get a chance to see Len and Mark much, but any time we did, it was always nice.

Everything was clean and tidy for our stay. Their home was warm and inviting and also conveniently located. Theres a convenience store right across the street, the bus stop is only a few steps from the house, and the tram is about a 10 minute walk away. 

The room for our stay was comfortable and always a good temperature. The bed was comfortable and I was never lacking a good nights rest. The bathroom was nice, incredible water pressure in the shower and a full tub. Sorry again about hogging up the hot water that morning, Mark! 

Len and Mark are first class people, as is their hospitality. From the time we arrived to the time we left, they were warm and kind. I felt incredibly welcomed in their home and I feel lucky to have stayed with them."
6850630,431994547,4/2/2019,Nice and cozy room with everything you need in a charming house.  Excellent connection to the city centre. Len and Mark are wonderful hosts.
6850630,447291157,5/3/2019,"Charming house accessible by bus from Dublin city centre (20 minutes). Quiet enjoyed during our 3 nights stay.
Home of Len & Mark super friendly
A good address that we recommend"
6850630,451803976,5/12/2019,"Len & Marks place surpassed expectations. Very hospitable, the definition of going above and beyond. The room/house is gorgeous, and perfectly clean. The location is so convenient to many sites & a quick trip into city center. I couldnt recommend this place highly enough. Cant wait to visit again."
6850630,464331470,6/5/2019,"Sander and I stayed at Mark & Len's place during our five-day trip to Dublin. We had a wonderful time! Mark & Len's house is beautiful and the room as well as the en suite bathroom were very comfortable, clean and everything we needed was in there :). We also enjoyed the lite breakfast in the morning.

Len and Mark are both very kind, generous, helpful and hospitable. From the moment they welcomed us into their house, until the moment we left, they made us feel at home. For example, they gave us information about Dublin, the public transport system and which sites to visit. But they also invited us to share a glass of wine and whiskey and were genuinely curious how we experienced our days in Dublin/Ireland.

We would highly recommend this place. Thanks guys for making our holiday so memorable!"
6850630,480778090,7/3/2019,"Oh my DEER (haha)
I have an unforgettable 5 days with Mark and Len
Theyre lovely friendly and intelligent couple I ever met in my whole life . 
The house location is wonderful for the guests, not far from the airport,quiet neighborhood,and close to bus stop and Grocery store.
Ricky (dog)is so adorable,such a sweet cute pie .
Im telling you guys the house is spacious,refreshing and stylish .On a scale from 1 to 10, I would say 25. 
And they provide delicious breakfast for me every day . 
Organic berries from the yard , yummy yogurt, fresh croissant with jam and butter,Cereal with Milk,and fancy espresso coffee machine . 
The room I was staying is amazing. Soft bed with four pillows, and big bathtub for the guest. 
Theyre patient when I have emotional breakdown , theyre good listener .
Theyre my lifesaver when I got injured in the Phoenix park . Len got out his important meeting, and Mark drove me to city private clinic. Theyre my hero and guardians. How can I return this favor in the rest of my life. Oh god 
I would never forget the practical advice they gave 
I would never forget the love they showed 
I would never forget the hospitality 
I would never forget ¶ I LOVE YOU GUYS 
Anyone seeing this review , I just want to tell you that book this beautiful house without any hesitation, theyre not just your host , theyre your friends and family . 
Btw Mark is Ryan Gosling with sexy Irish accent.
Check it out if u dont believe me ,but he is way taller 
And hotter . According to TIME magazine 
Again ,Love you ,Ill be back in the future 
Much love"
6850630,484027673,7/8/2019,"You will not be disappointed! From having some wine ready after 9hours of delays to suggesting an itinerary change to get a real feel of dublin to showing us one of the most local pubs nearby, these guys were great! Their place is welcoming as are they and great location if you are like me and dont want to be IN the city center. Short ride with uber or taxi to city center and also close to public transportation as well. The house is beautiful in itself, but the friendliness of the hosts make it even more unique.  I would stay again if ever in dublin!"
6850630,528615442,9/13/2019,"This was a return trip for us.  We wouldnt consider staying anywhere else in Dublin.  Mark and Len are amazing hosts.  The are so hospitable you will feel like you are staying with old friends. 
The accommodations are wonderful - clean and comfortable.  Great bed and shower.  
Location is perfect, only a short ride into the city center.  
Mark and Len are awesome at making suggestions for things to do and places to eat or have a pint.  
Great conversations at the end of the day."
6850630,531406104,9/17/2019,"Best accomodations so far.  Easily 5 stars.  Exceeded our expectations. Very comfortable, clothing optional, great conversatioms and travel advice.  Super clean and served a great breakfast.  We will definitely stay here when we return!!!"
6850630,542314283,10/6/2019,"Beautiful home and wonderful hosts! 
Very easy to get to the center. There are a couple decent pubs within a few minutes walk from the house, including a brewery with good beer and excellent pizza. 
The ad mentions dogs, but don't let that put you off if you're not a fan of dogs. They keep to themselves (though happy with pets if you're offering) and I never heard a peep out of either."
6895847,420350702,3/6/2019,"Very clean, stylish apartment. Everything you need is there including cooking utensils, dishwasher, washing machine, hair dryer. Only one very minor caveat, and that is the good restaurants are at least a 15-minute walk away.  The SPAR across the street is very handy and actually has great fresh food options compared with convenience stores in the States. Bed very comfortable.  Very quiet building but the church bells across the street and the traffic on Patrick street can be noisy.

Fiona and Breda very helpful in Maggie's absence.

Overall, an excellent value and would definitely stay at Maggie's place again!"
6895847,423478704,3/14/2019,"A perfect, cozy, lovely home spot in an excellent location.  Clean, comfortable, great kitchen, with extra care given from beginning to end.   Right on the transportation line, with magnificent views of beautiful St. Patrick's Church.   We'd book again in a heartbeat."
6895847,428894496,3/26/2019,"Cute, well appointed, spacious flat in a PERFECT location. Everything is super convenient from Maggies place and I would definitely recommend it :)"
6895847,430898529,3/31/2019,"Close to town, easy walk to all amenities, cosy apartment for short stay in Dublin."
6895847,435073083,4/9/2019,Fantastic location - fantastic host - fantastic apartment. Well definitely look Maggie up next time were coming through Dublin.
6895847,440847720,4/21/2019,"Great location & great view of the park/ church. Be a little careful at night time waking the back streets walking home. We had a little difficulty. Bottom floor stank of stagnant smoke. Bedrooms are small, one is way smaller & is smaller than a double bed. The beds are not good. Host flipped both mattresses so we were actually sleeping on the hard bottom of the mattress. Not too happy about that. Full kitchen & bathroom were great. 
We had a good stay. Apart from not sleeping the 4 nights due to the bad mattresses, it was a pleasant stay."
6895847,444661657,4/28/2019,Great centrally located apartment
6895847,448633241,5/5/2019,"Appartement conforme au descriptif, au calme en plein centre ville."
6895847,450782422,5/10/2019,"This place was great! The view of St Patricks Cathedral was gorgeous and it was walking distance to a lot of fun stuff. Maggie was great, helpful, and responded quickly. Wed love to stay here again!"
6895847,455906551,5/20/2019,Perfect location in short walking distance to so many attractions. Great clean space. Wonderful host
6895847,461258610,5/31/2019,"I chose Maggies apartment based on location. It doesnt get any better for seeing Dublins key sites on foot or by bus. The beds are sublime. Kitchen well equipped if you want to cook. I especially appreciated a real coffee maker. The shower is a winner- lots of pressure. Most assuredly, I would return and highly recommend."
6895847,464364254,6/5/2019,"Maggies flat was better than expected. The location is extremely convenient, theres a small market across the road for snacks and their fresh sandwiches they made were really good. The flat is spotless, comfortable, personal effects at a minimum, and has all the amenities I look for. We did our laundry in the morning and let our clothing dry on the rack in the closet all day - set it up by the window. Was essentially perfect. Wed definitely recommend it to anyone."
6895847,468322076,6/12/2019,"The place is great, just as described. Its clean, located within walking distance of everything in Dublin. Maggie was very responsive, we arrived much earlier than expected and she answered our message and we were able to get in earlier than anticipated. Would definitely recommend"
6895847,477024653,6/27/2019,"Superb location, comfortable beds,  easy space,  safe nest feeling."
6895847,481183184,7/4/2019,The location is absolutely fabulous.  Amazing view of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the apartment was exactly as advertised.  Would highly recommend it!
6895847,483309049,7/7/2019,Great place!
6895847,487752251,7/14/2019,"This apartment is in an excellent location and it was easy to walk to many of the sites. Being right across the street from an 800 year old church was a unique treat too. Although we didnt cook any meals there, the full kitchen is well equipped with everything, including a washing machine which came in very handy. Having an elevator is a huge plus.  The street below is a main road, so the traffic noise never really stops, so be sure to bring ear plugs for sleeping."
6895847,496250839,7/27/2019,Amazing opportunity to stay at Maggies. Highly recommend!
6895847,501189940,8/3/2019,Maggie's place is on an ideal location. It is spacious and light with all the amenities you need.  We loved being close  to the centre of town.
6895847,506053885,8/10/2019,"Maggies place is exactly as pictured and is spotlessly clean. There is an elevator in the building that helps with luggage. The shower was wonderful and had hot water and great water pressure. Communication was excellent and the Wi-Fi worked perfectly.

The flat overlooks St Patricks Church which offers a stunning view as well as church bells counting out the hour, every hour, all day and all night. Its a third floor unit and neighbors are quiet but there is street noise. Earplugs solved that for me.

Its a safe neighborhood. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. The location is good... its a short walk to Temple Bar, The Brazen Head, and the Guinness Storehouse. We appreciated the proximity and ease of getting around without a car. I would absolutely stay there again."
6895847,510536474,8/16/2019,"A great located appartment vis-a-vis the St. Patricks Cathedral - I loved the view! Comfortably equipped, very clean, everything was lovely. I hope I will return some day."

6895847,530850178,9/16/2019,"Great cozy place, very convenient location for walking around Dublin and a lovely view of the cathedral! The size was just right for three of us."
6895847,532793002,9/20/2019,You will not be disappointed if you stay here. Wonderful.
6895847,537309730,9/28/2019,"Great location, authentic Irish area. Clothes didn't dry well due to the humid air, so don't plan to do laundry while on vacation. You can get Taxis right outside the door. Great view of St Patricks Cathedral."
6895847,546035781,10/13/2019,This was my second stay at Maggie's flat. The location is very good. The flat is fully equipped and comfortable.
6895847,550678735,10/19/2019,"Lovely place as described.  It was very clean and we enjoyed the location, our thoughtful host,  and Bredas resourcefulness and kindness.  She offered  us a shower at her flat when the hot water failed!  However, the problem was quickly solved."
6895847,560001971,11/5/2019,Fantastic location and comfortable
6896840,455218036,5/19/2019,Patricia is helpful. We have been welcomed and supported for any needs. Warmfull communication. Location is perfect for those who prefer to be out of city .
6896840,484041651,7/8/2019,"This place is a great value. The room is extremely clean and comfortable. Both the double bed and the single bed are comfortable.

Patricia and Ian are very warm and welcoming hosts. They were quick to respond to any questions and were proactively helpful.

The location is ideal as well. The house is very close to a bus stop; from there, it is an easy ride into the city center.

Overall, this is a phenomenal place to stay, which I would highly recommend."
6914056,421966980,3/10/2019,Very clean place - great walking distance to city centre
6914056,431643437,4/1/2019,"Tatianes place is welcoming. The room is very clean and bathroom as well, with all necessary amenities. She was very responsive with questions we had and flexible regarding check in. The place is also walking distance from city center."
6914056,434006293,4/7/2019,"Everything was perfect and clean. The flat is near the citycenter and we could use the kitchen.
Thank you Tatiane!"
6914056,439503364,4/19/2019,"Tatianes place is in such a great location, walking distance from everything we wanted to see and do! Close to Brazen Head and only a couple minutes walk to Teelings Whiskey Distillery and St Patricks Cathedral. The room was cozy and comfortable and we had a great time staying with Tatiane!"
6914056,441784796,4/22/2019,Goed onderkomen. Snelle reactie op berichten.
6914056,450357285,5/9/2019,They arranged early check-in for us! They are really flexible and friendly to guests.
6914056,451177262,5/11/2019,It was great having access to the kitchen and being able to cook meals. It was close enough to walk into the city centre of Dublin.
6914056,455218736,5/19/2019,"Once you enter the apartment, you directly enter the living room. We thought it was quite noisy in the room. 
When we asked what the best spot is to get a breakfast, we got the answer that we should look it up our self."
6914056,462467542,6/2/2019,"Tatiane and her brother were lovely, and wonderful, accommodating hosts once we got in. The only reason for 4 stars is due to a lack of communication after answering when our flight would arrive, and the following difficulty in finding the right door to the apartment complex. We were given no code to buzz, and while I take some brunt of responsibility for not having WiFi, I feel its fair to share complicity with AirBnB hosts who Im sure know thats something to address with a bit better initiative. We were stuck at midnight for half an hour struggling to find the correct Southgate door, and make contact. Again, once we were in, they were fantastic, fun, and respectful. Overall, I certainly recommend staying with these clean, thoughtful people! We had an awesome stay!!"
6914056,467351286,6/10/2019,"Great location, walking distance to city center. Good ammenities!"

6914056,478639124,6/30/2019,Had a nice weekend there
6914056,482992693,7/7/2019,Fine place to stay if you are out all day
6914056,488698478,7/15/2019,Clean and nice place. Funny detail with the bunny!
6914056,492291759,7/21/2019,"I am using airbnb for the last years ... And it is the cleanest flat that i found. Really quiet, central and high quality flat. We slept as babies :)"
6914056,502216452,8/4/2019,"The place is great if you want to check out Dublin by foot (10-15' walking-distance) and still want some peace and quiet during the night. Tatiane is talkative and very open minded but also very busy, so we did not see her much. The beds are comfy and we were able to use the kitchen to make breakfast in the morning."
6914056,508019800,8/12/2019,Great location. Wonderful host. Would stay again.
6914056,517233742,8/25/2019,"Awsome place, lovely host, very clean apartment, would definitely recommend for short or long stays."
6914056,523269825,9/3/2019,"A nice one night stay. In a quiet part of town where you can walk to everything. Was difficult to find at first, but the place is great and the facilities are great. Overall a nice stay."
6914056,523789341,9/4/2019,Good location.  Very sad situation in the suite with a large rabbit in a very small and filthy cage - depressing - left alone and trapped in this small cage in the middle of the living space.  Safe yourself a bunch of euros and stay in a hostel - same type of set up!
6914056,527647934,9/11/2019,Tatianes apartment is located in a large courtyard setting off the road. Safe and pleasant. The space was very clean. The beds were comfortable and the shower was good. It was good to have the bathroom  for our own use. The cotton sheets and beds were comfortable also.
6914056,528081864,9/12/2019,"Was given the location via Airbnb, looked for the place for an hour after back and forth messaging. Given a direct pin and went to that location and there were no places. Asked many people walking around the area they said they never heard of the apartments. Tried calling the number and didnt work. Host/her brother never came out to help us or made an effort to direct us. Had to find another Airbnb as it was obvious the host was not giving us any more options."
6914056,529987118,9/15/2019,"We did not meet Tatiane in person, but her brother gave us access to the appartment. They were both very friendly and very kind about flexible check in and out times. The room and bathroom are nice and clean, and the bunny is super cute. We were allowed to use the kitchen, but there was no milk and cereal and the dishwasher did not work."
6914056,533998042,9/22/2019,"We had a pleasant short stay. The private room and bathroom were both very clean and comfortable. Breakfast items were not provided as mentioned in the description, but there is a Lidl just up the road so we managed. We did not properly meet Tatiane which was a little disappointing. The flat is in a good location however and their bunny is adorable!"
6914056,537853930,9/29/2019,"Tatiane and her flatmate were kind with us, we could leave our luggages at the apartment after check-out. We had an own bathroom, we could use their kitchen. Everything was fine."
6914056,543192400,10/7/2019,Excellent place to stay
6914056,546163701,10/13/2019,"Nice and quiet place. Good location, 10min walking to the center. 
Very good conditions. Friendly and helpful host."
6914056,552342097,10/21/2019,"City center at a 20m walk, everything was very clean and the hosts are nice.
We felt quite at home. Recommended"
6914056,555156763,10/27/2019,"Lovely flat in a good location in Dublin. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom facilities were great although showering may be difficult for any tall people.... Although we didnt meet Tatiane till our last day, her brother was very welcoming and flexible for when we checked in. Would recommend for a weekend in Dublin "
6914056,558715366,11/3/2019,"Good option to stay In Dublin, walking distance from city center and attractions."
6914056,562835262,11/11/2019,"Great place, conveniently located and easy to get into city centre. Very good communication and friendly! Thanks for letting us stay!"
6944932,422552177,3/11/2019,A comfortable and well-situated apartment that's great for exploring Dublin and surrounding areas. Host was very good with communication and accommodating of our needs.
6944932,425518592,3/18/2019,The place is nice and it was easy to contact the host.
6944932,431037304,3/31/2019,It was an enjoyable stay
6944932,432272350,4/3/2019,"Overall the place is as represented, just a little smaller on the first floor than expected.  With location of bathroom, its a little tight to get ready all at the same time. Park views are lovely.  Cab drivers always thought we were in the park, so if you call one make sure you explain location.  We had a good time, and being able to walk to grocery and pubs is very convenient."
6944932,435112831,4/9/2019,The house was clean and comunication good but it was very hard to close the doors and light in bathroom didn't work. Edward wasn't at Dublin during our visit so he can't fix it.
6944932,438302078,4/16/2019,Location was great but felt it was over priced for all the maintenance issues
6944932,441842838,4/22/2019,The house is situated in quiet and pleasant surroundings with lots of public transportation to the city and a grocery store and good pubs nearby. The house is clean and well equipped. Edward responded swiftly to inquiries and left fairly comprehensive instructions in the house. He should change the lock on the front door. It presents difficulties for exhausted travelers on first arrival.
6944932,443181083,4/25/2019,Excellent location and great to have direct access into the Park.  The Angler's Rest was very nice local restaurant.
6944932,445948139,4/30/2019,Ottima posizione e casa molto silenziosa e tranquilla. Lo consiglio in particolare alle famiglie che vogliono visitare Dublino!
6944932,449701808,5/7/2019,"We enjoyed our stay.  The place was very clean and is a lovely space.  There is a door from the grounds of the apartment into Phoenix Park which was lovely to use.  Lots of buses pass through Chapelizard into the city centre, and it was really handy to be able to get the Aircoach to Dublin Airport from Heuston, which is very near.  We thought it was very good value.  Thanks Fran"
6944932,471859608,6/18/2019,"We found the townhouse to be conveniently located just outside of the city center of Dublin. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen was fully appointed. We were able to make coffee, cook breakfast, and relax in the evenings. Convenience items were left for us such as salt, pepper, oil, tea, coffee, etc.  Those were nice touches. The access to Phoenix Park was a great plus. Communication about access to the townhouse was clear, and we had no issues with that part of it.  We never had any contact with the hosts during our stay, and that was fine.  It was nice, also, to be able to park our rental car there at no additional cost.  We could use the car when we wanted to travel farther distances, but we were also close to public transportation to the city center.  We did have one minor issue, though, with the townhouse.  The hot water heater is extremely small, so we were lucky if two people could take a 5-10 minute shower in the mornings.  At night, only one person could manage to have hot water for a shower. We were not told about this issue until a day or two before we arrived.  There were four of us there (all adults), so one of us wasn't able to take a shower at one time or another.  Other than that, we had no complaints with our stay.  We left well before the check out time as we had to catch a plane to London.  I emailed the hosts to let them know we were gone and that we had taken out all garbage and cleaned up as best as possible (there were no check out instructions other than the time). Later that day, the host emailed me to ask about a stylus on the turntable; they told us it was missing and wanted to know what happened.  Well, we couldn't tell them because we truly didn't know.  What I told them was that on our 3rd night there, we tried to use it, but when we found that it wouldn't work, we turned it off and closed the lid.  We never gave it another thought until I got an Airbnb request for us to pay for a replacement stylus that I was told was 1 year old.  Now, I would fully expect to pay for any damages that we might incur, but we are really at a loss about this.  It has left us feeling awkward and frustrated with no real means of solving it adequately for either us or the hosts."
6959346,419054298,3/3/2019,"Kate is fab! She couldnt have been more accommodating and gave us lots of local information. The apartment itself has everything you could need and more, from shower gel to cookies. Location is very central making it easy to get around on foot. Thank you for a lovely stay."
6959346,421394840,3/9/2019,"Kate was an amazing and accommodating host with lots of great suggestions for nearby places to eat or shop. Her apt was lovely - clean, functional and very well located. Great bakery around the corner for morning breads, Queen of Tarts for snacks/tea/ breakfast with great scones downstairs and Scout around the left corner for beautiful Irish wool scarves, blankets and clothes (better priced than on Grafton and better made goods too). This was a perfect apt for three of us, though it can hold 1 more comfortably."
6959346,423885646,3/15/2019,"Kate was really friendly and quick at getting back to me, as well as flexible in letting us arrive a little early. She also gave us various tips and directions for our stay in Dublin and had boiled the kettle ready for our arrival, which was a nice tough.

The flat was in an ideal location for everything in Dublin. Right next to Temple Bar area, full of bars and places to eat and also easy walking distance to everything else we wanted in Dublin, such as cathedrals, the castle, Grafton Street, train station etc etc. No car or bus needed for all the main attractions. It was also down a quiet side street, so it didn't feel like we were in a party area, when it came to wanting to get some sleep and relax. The area also felt very safe. Would definitely visit again."
6959346,425518009,3/18/2019,"Great appartement near Temple bar. Although in the heart of the tourist attractions, the appartement is in a quiet area. We were in Dublin for the St-Patrick's Parade and the appartement was conveniently situated beside the route of the parade. We recommend to anyone who is looking to be near downtown attractions while still wanting some calm away from the crowds."
6959346,428949144,3/26/2019,Kate was a great host and the location was very ideal and close to everything.  Kate was always quick to reply and very helpful with various questions unrelated to the apartment.  I would definitely recommend staying with her!
6959346,430840316,3/31/2019,"Kate is an amazing woman, so kind, friendly and helpful. Her house is Absouletely fantastic, very modern, comfortable and extonishingly clean. Kate as all the little bits and bobs stored in the house e.g teas, shampoo etc. this made the house so homely and on our arrival to the house, Kate had the kettle boiling for us, making us feel so welcome, we would really recommend staying with Kate, and we look forward to staying in her house in the future. 
Thanks Kate"
6959346,432591691,4/4/2019,"Kates place was outstanding. Excellent location, clean, tidy and communication with her was effortless. Hard to find any flaws with this gem of a place."
6959346,434015549,4/7/2019,"Perfect location, very good and effective communication and all you need is available in the apartment."
6959346,435726606,4/11/2019,Very central apartment. Very easy access from airport on the number 747 Airlink bus. Great host. Great communication and Kate allowed us to check in early. Would stay again
6959346,439184909,4/18/2019,Stylish comfortable heart of Dublin.
6959346,443091749,4/25/2019,Great place!! Very clean and excellent location! Kate made the process very easy and had great communication. Thanks Kate!
6959346,444068442,4/27/2019,"We stayed 2 nights at Kates place in Dublin. This was the last part of our road trip of Ireland. It was perfect to have some extra space and laundry facilities by then. The location was excellent. Right by everything you want to see but still somewhat quiet. There are several cute eateries literally right out the door. 
The place was as described. Kate was very communicative and nice. Id recommend her place for sure."
6959346,444745017,4/28/2019,Wo derail apartment and a lovely host who let us check in early as we had a morning flight. The apartment has everything you need and more and the location is ideal. Highly recommended :-)
6959346,448460440,5/5/2019,Kate is a fabulous host and her place is ideally located right by the hustle and bustle of Dublin but on a quiet residential street. It was great for our plans of exploring Dublin and also taking day trips via bus tous. Nothing greater than a long day out in the Irish countryside than knowing you're going to have a wonderful place to rest after all the day's activities (and perhaps night time fun after an evening stroll in Temple bar). It's such a beautiful place and Kate really made sure our vacation was truly a delightful holiday.
6959346,450827522,5/10/2019,"A true 5 star listing! After staying in several disappointing places as we travelled across the UK and Ireland, it was a relief to stay in a place truly worthy of the good reviews. Excellent communication from Kate, great location, easy access with the elevator and extra set of keys, and a beautiful clean condo! Beds were comfortable and the shower and kitchen amenities were great. Thank you for the milk and cookies too! Would definitely stay here again."
6959346,451823159,5/12/2019,"Kate is an awesome host.  She met us at the bus stop right outside the apartment.  Very informative about the local area.  And her place is in the BEST location... easy bus access, city center & Temple bar area.  Markets very close.  Overall, a very pleasurable experience.  Highly recommend her place."
6959346,453296745,5/15/2019,"Kate's apartment was exactly what you'd want for visiting Dublin. Super central location close to all main attractions, but on a nice pedestrian street without any unwanted noise.  Apartment was spacious and clean - would definitely highly recommend."
6959346,456695947,5/22/2019,"Kates place is perfectly located to explore Dublin, and super quiet for the part of the city where its located. Would absolutely stay again."

6959346,461212934,5/31/2019,You cant get a better location! Great area for kids and adults. I was traveling with my in-laws and my children and the apartment was perfect for us.  Love the Irish hospitality!
6959346,464724860,6/6/2019,"Kates place was perfect!  Location was outstanding, apartment exactly as pictures indicate, super clean, and she even left us cookies and milk!  We love Kate and her apartment and you will too!"
6959346,465209832,6/7/2019,"Katies flat is in a great location, easy to get to from the airport and to walk around Dublin.  Katie was very helpful with tips about travel and the right bus stop and Luas stop so that we didnt get lost!  The flat has everything you need for a short stay.  thank you for hosting my son and I."
6959346,472296440,6/19/2019,"Great location and our host, Kate, was very responsive.  We would stay at Kates place again."
6959346,474602488,6/23/2019,Kate was a great host. She contacted me in advance of our stay to ensure we had all the information we needed to get to flat which was very helpful. The flat is in a fantastic location and is lovely inside. I would highly recommend staying at this flat if you are wanting to travel to Dublin.
6959346,475514147,6/24/2019,"We loved our stay on Cow's Lane. Great space, location, and amenities! It was the perfect place to spend our first night in Ireland. Breakfast at The Queen of Tarts was lovely. We hope to return and spend more time here!"
6959346,476896346,6/27/2019,Great stay in fab position
6959346,481187927,7/4/2019,"My brothers and I stayed at Kates place during our stop in Dublin. Kate gave very good instructions on how to get to her place, and she was very easy to communicate with. Her place is located in the middle of the Temple Bar area, with most major sites in walking distance. I would definitely stay here again!"
6959346,485752918,7/11/2019,This is a quiet and lovely flat in the heart of Temple Bar. We would definitely stay here again and Kate is a super hostess.
6959346,486921331,7/13/2019,"We had a great time @ Kates place. It was conveniently located to the city centre & Temple Bar. We were a family of four w/ adult children. The space accommodated us nicely. Nice touches with the tea, mil&, & biscuits."
6959346,487861584,7/14/2019,Kate was very friendly to deal with in messages and on the day and the apartment was in a great central location. It was lovely to stay with friends and have the living space too.
6959346,490299698,7/18/2019,"Kates Temple Bar apartment is perfect for a girls getaway in Dublin! You can walk almost anywhere in Dublin from her place, and it is in a safe part of town. We felt comfortable walking back from a pub at night. The Temple Bar area can be very loud and busy but overall it was not too loud. It might be too noisy for a family with young kids, especially on the weekend, but it was absolutely perfect for us. It was great to have a kitchen. Kate was very hospitable and gave us tips and suggestions for getting the most out of our Dublin stay. We are definitely staying again if we come back!"
6959346,490815307,7/19/2019,As described. Close to airport bus link. Nice place.
6959346,492325050,7/21/2019,"GREAT find! this place is right in Temple Bar, walkable to all over the city and main attractions. Kate was so hospitable and met us downstairs, gave us recommendations, and the place had lots of helpful amenities (even multiple iPhone chargers!). Would definitely recommend Kates place again for anyone coming to Dublin. It comfortably fit 6 people. Also, try all the cakes at Queen of Tarts downstairs!"
6959346,493343905,7/22/2019,Lovely apartment in a great location! Kate was very good at keeping in touch with us. She also provided some very useful local tips. Very enjoyable stay.
6959346,494388937,7/24/2019,"Kate's place is perfectly located for exploring the city. It's clean, comfortable,  and mostly quiet (it was very warm while we were there, so had the windows open and some noise from a nearby bar could be heard into the wee hours). Our party of 4 adults were easily accommodated and everyone commented how much the liked the space. Highly recommend!"
6959346,495666420,7/26/2019,"We stayed here two nights on a family vacation, four adults and one infant and were very comfortable. Kates place was central to all of our Dublin activities, including a Do Dublin bus stop. Highly recommend staying here."
6959346,501307659,8/3/2019,Great locationîclose to everythingîand a cute apartment. Tucked just a bit off of a main street so the area was lively. There is a great breakfast and a great wine bar right outside the door. Wonderful places to start and end the day.
6959346,517354313,8/25/2019,Kate is super nice. Pleasant stay.
6959346,522622740,9/2/2019,"Kate was a great host, apartment was in an amazing location. Close to everything, but in a little quieter area of Temple Bar."
6959346,523757440,9/4/2019,"We had such a fun time exploring Dublin from Kates cute and clean apartment.  The location on a pedestrian alley was so welcome after walking the busy streets all day¶and great for a quiet rest while still being part of the bustling city!  We began and ended our days right outside the apartment:  great breakfast place (Queen of Tarts) and cute wine bar/restaurant (Piglet.)  The neighborhood is safe and walkable to most sights in Dublin and the building itself is secure with a double set of auto-locking entry doors. This was a nice feature for myself and two daughters.  Kate is a great host, met us at the apartment and was available during our stay if we had any issues (we didnt.)  Kate stocked the apartment nicely with goodies, coffee/tea and extra toiletries.  Thank you, Kate, for sharing your Temple Bar apartment!"
6959346,536202398,9/26/2019,Kate's place is fabulous. It is a lovely space with many amenities and she makes you feel so welcome. It is centrally located and there are great shops and restaurants in walking distance near by. We had an excellent stay.

6959346,544557278,10/10/2019,"Great choice for a place right in the heart of Temple Bar, by the river and near so much.  The apartment is spacious and amenities are nice for the foreign traveler.  We spent each night lounging in the comfy living room recapping our day.  For sure, visit the Queen of Tarts cafe on Cow (Website hidden by Airbnb) is amazing.  This spot is a A+!"
6959346,545463954,10/12/2019,"Kate offers a wonderful apartment in Temple Bar, steps away from many of the sites visitors will likely want to visit.  We walked comfortably to Christ Church, St. Patrick's, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Iveach Gardens, Guinness Storehouse, Dublin Castor, the National Museum of Ireland, and pubs in Temple Bar.  What a great location!  Having our bedrooms on the quieter courtyard side of Cow's Lane was also a plus.  Kate met us at the apartment and was available throughout our stay for help we needed.  A great Dublin Airbnb."
6959346,546880839,10/14/2019,"Kate was a great host, her communication was super speedy and she even gave us travel directions from the airport. The apartment is a lovely space and the perfect central location for exploring and being able to pop back throughout the day. Lots of guide books and recommendation lists in the flat, packed with ideas! Plus biscuits and extras in the fridge! Will defo be back and would highly recommend, especially for groups of friends."
6959346,553088765,10/23/2019,"This airbnb is perfectly situated for any adventure you wish to have in Dublin proper. We recommend Queen of Tarts for pastries or a full breakfast. It really seemed to be a 10 minute walk from anywhere we planned to be...Trinity College, Grafton St, the Famine statue or anywhere else excepting temple bar, which was 5 mins away. Lots of resturants and pubs in the area too. The shower had great hot water and pressure and the beds were firm but comfortable."
6959346,554472892,10/26/2019,Kate was very communicative.  Cow's Lane is prime location in Temple Bar.  Close enough to the action with enough distance from the madness.  Everything is at your fingertips.  The apartment was very comfortable and as a single traveler I felt safe.  I would absolutely stay there again.
6959346,558048982,11/2/2019,"Thanks again for providing such a pleasant place to stay. This apartment was a large, very clean place that is located very close to the main bar/entertainment area of Dublin but given its location on a quiet walking area it remains surprisingly quiet. There was no AC but not unexpected in Ireland. Cold water in the fridge and local tips were nice touches. Located near a bakery and breakfast restaurant is very convenient. The WiFi wasnt initially working but after some investigation the next day I saw it was unplugged and was not an issue subsequently. 

Overall a wonderful clean place very conveniently located but still relatively quiet. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
6959346,559506353,11/4/2019,Beautiful appartment and great location. Perfect for a stay in Dublin.
6959346,560621763,11/7/2019,"We loved our stay at Kate's apartment! She was a wonderful host, providing easy check-in, local tips, fast and reliable wifi, and good communication.

6972110,421006906,3/8/2019,"Pauls apartment is in the heart of Temple Bar, next to an abundance of activities, bars, and restaurants. Paul was very quick to respond and was flexible with us leaving for a late check-out. The instructions for check in were very clear and thorough!"
6972110,426915554,3/22/2019,Amazing location and very clear detailed check-in instructions.
6972110,429202894,3/27/2019,Great location. We only stayed for a night but it was what we needed and Paul was so quick to respond! Appreciate their promptness!
6972110,433390792,4/6/2019,"This place is great for staying in the Temple Bar area for one or two nights. I wouldnt recommend for someone staying in Dublin for longer. If youre looking to explore Dublin and the nightlife with some friends, this place is it. If youre looking to nestle in for an extended trip and make this place your own, I wouldnt recommend it. The photos in the listing are a bit outdated and the apartment wasnt as clean as it appeared. That said, Paul was great at communicating and the rest of the process went smoothly."
6972110,435065105,4/9/2019,Great location in the city center! Next to a pretty loud club/venue but they seemed to get quiet pretty early so not sure if it is actually open late. Excellent nights rest!
6972110,435431197,4/10/2019,"Paul was a great host. His flat in Dublin is in a perfect location--very close to Temple Bar and right down the street from a few cozy pubs.

6972110,445977106,4/30/2019,A little tired and dated. Perfect location. Shame the place isnt as pictured. Just needs some tlc. But great for location to temple bar.
6972110,451208963,5/11/2019,AMAZING LOCATION!!!  Dont expect anything other than a crashpad.  Paul allowed us to check in early which we appreciated.  The apartment layout was as expected.  It wast very clean and bedroom carpet is in horrible shape.  That being said......if you dont mind the $ and arent planning on spending time in the apartment its as good of a spot as you can find from a location standpoint.
6972110,452965506,5/14/2019,Great little spot in temple bar district. Very comfortable. Not too noisy considering the area.
6972110,453203205,5/15/2019,"Great value in a perfect location. Flat is very secure and makes for a great base.

Paul makes for a top host who communicates a lot of tips and gives clear instructions."
6972110,457975265,5/25/2019,Great spot in a great location. Will be back again
6972110,461229038,5/31/2019,"Location is great, but we had no hot water for almost the entire 2 day stay, which was totally unacceptable having just arrived into Dublin from a long haul flight from Australia. It took several attempts to manually adjust the heating system to be able to get any hot water flowing. No instructions were provided for this and we had to contact the host to get details about this, which meant we could only have a shower on the last day. The kitchen sink was completely blocked too which meant we couldn't wash up or run much water. Very disappointed as everything this could be a great place given its location."
6972110,461945507,6/1/2019,"Pauls place is very central.  It's a very simple and spartan apartment with minimal appointments.  If you are looking for a very central place to stay in understandably noisy Temple Bar, this may be the place for you."
6972110,462768900,6/2/2019,Lovely accommodation very clean great location
6972110,464268474,6/5/2019,Paul was a great host. His response time is great and he is very helpful. The location of the apartment is in a little lane directly in Temple Bar. If there is a construction site behind the building it could be a bit noisy.  The apartment is very big and there is everything you need. Perfect location for Pub and city visiting in Dublin. Thanks Paul!
6972110,465207096,6/7/2019,"Im sure this is a great location for people wanting to bar hop and stay out all night. We had to leave by 6:30 am and so had to find a different parking garage then suggested in the listing and walk a distance. 
His directions are very well thought out and precise but because we had to park somewhere else it was still difficult to find. It was very noisy all night, and the bathroom was not clean. Notably some of this is our fault upon booking and choosing a place that fit our activities, because of this Im giving a 3 stars, rather than lower knowing we could have chosen better."
6972110,465796848,6/8/2019,"Central location, within short walk to Temple Bar, shopping and sights. Nice and tidy kitchen and living area.  Quiet location. Would recommend!"
6972110,467869029,6/11/2019,Amazing!!!
6972110,468333193,6/12/2019,Ideal location for city centre stay.. Paul was great to deal with and good value for money.
6972110,470423191,6/16/2019,Great location!
6972110,471412918,6/17/2019,"Great location, apartment was adequate. Communication consisted of 3 long pre planned messages and nothing else"
6972110,478064974,6/29/2019,"Great location! However, if you are looking for a quiet place to sleep, this is not for you. We knew it was a busy area, so we were prepared for the noise level. They place wasn't spotless, but was in no way off putting. We would definitely stay here again!"
6972110,481763055,7/5/2019,"Pauls place was exactly what I needed. Central location, great apartment, and simple enough to check-in and check-out. Would stay again!"
6972110,484210410,7/8/2019,"Paul was a wonderful host! Quick to respond to messages and gave great local advice. This sizable apartment is located in the city center, steps away from some of the most popular bars in the city! If you arent used to city noise, this might not be the place for you. But if you want a true Dublin living experience, book now! Friendly neighbors, great location, clean, responsive host."
6972110,487774376,7/14/2019,The location is perfect. It wasn't my cleanest experience but was a good value for the location for sure!
6972110,489272422,7/16/2019,"Great location, everything we needed while staying in Dublin."
6972110,490892757,7/19/2019,"Perfect spot to explore Dublin by foot.  Tons of bars nearby.  It was just me and my wife, so we had plenty of space.  Very clean as well."
6972110,493111152,7/22/2019,The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6972110,493969467,7/23/2019,It's in an excellent location right in the middle of Temple Bar district. Perfect for a good place to crash after a night out.
6972110,495686086,7/26/2019,Great location for nightlife and tourist activities. Not as clean as expected but otherwise great spot.
6972110,500483194,8/2/2019,Paul was a great host and the apartment was everything youd want for a stay in Dublin. Close to anyplace youd like to go and very comfortable.
6972110,503062119,8/5/2019,"Great location as it's near everything, quiet at spot at night."
6972110,504825743,8/8/2019,"Great place to stay. Comfortable, easy and fun. Comfy bed and nice kitchen. Just bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper as its near the popular pubs."
6972110,510476150,8/16/2019,"Paul was amazing! Our flight was delayed meaning we werent going to meet the key pickup time (before midnight) and he was so kind to come and meet us and then walk with us all the way to the apartment!  The apartment location is perfect, 24hour store just doors down and a couple minute walk to all pubs and bars!  The apartment was all that we needed, somewhere to sleep and shower! We ate out for all meals so cant comment on anything in the kitchen.  If youre looking to be out and about and need a central base this is perfect! Would return for sure."
6972110,515132012,8/22/2019,Well placed and quiet location to visit Dublin. Just wished that the communication with Paul would have been more fluid.
6972110,517429573,8/25/2019,"Stay clear of this place.  The photo is not what it actually is.  If you have no problems with filthy floors, carpet, furniture and extremely questionable, old sheets and towels, this is your Dublin city-center dump.  (I have never written a review like this.)"
6972110,519893555,8/29/2019,"If you want to be in the middle of a beautiful city with lots going on, this is a nice safe cozy place! Thanks for your hospitality!"
6972110,522594890,9/2/2019,We loved staying at Pauls place for our 4 days in Dublin.  We could not have asked for a better location in the heart of Temple Bar.  The apartment and its location felt very safe which to me is hard to find in such a metropolitan area.  Paul was very responsive and offered plenty of local tips.  He even let us check in early which we really appreciated.  Check out was a breeze.  Highly recommend.  Would stay again if the occasion arises.
6972110,523351296,9/3/2019,The location of this apartment is perfect. We were able to walk everywhere!! Happy i was able to find this place while i did!
6972110,529197127,9/14/2019,"Great location to explore the city given our one night stay in Dublin. Absolutely centre of the city, which can get noisy but that's expected if you want to be in the midst of all the action. Apartment was also comfortable. Keys pick up arrangement could have been better."
6972110,529947390,9/15/2019,Great location for Dublin city. Would recommend!
6972110,531415332,9/17/2019,Great location on the edge of Dublins Cultural district. Easy walk to sites and dining. Paul provided excellent directions and made checking in/out and ease. Perfect place for a short weekend stop in the city.
6972110,531804301,9/18/2019,"Needs some cleaning, the toilet stopped working, very hot inside the room, there was heavy construction behind our room at 6am. These workers also peeked through the windows while I was getting ready (the blinds were broken and would not close). Positives: good location and Paul allowed early check in."
6972110,532186287,9/19/2019,"Excellent place & host. We very much enjoyed our stay and were thankful for Pauls suggestions. Key pick up is a bit out of the way, but its worth it for the location."
6972110,536798953,9/27/2019,"Fantastic location, easy checkin/checkout. This apartment is in the heart of the Temple Bar district within walking distance to all of the major attractions. Great nightlife options all around as well."
6972110,537914835,9/29/2019,"Great stay, thank you!"
6972110,540977858,10/4/2019,Apartment is exactly as described.  Right in the heart of Temple Bar you can't beat it for a night out in Dublin!
6972110,543663073,10/8/2019,Paul was very quick to respond to our messages and his apartment is in a great location.  Very easy to access Temple Bar.  The Parking deck is a little further than expected - carrying luggage.  Over all a nice place to stay
6972110,545429671,10/12/2019,Right in the middle of everything literally. Equipped kitchen with washer and dryer. Walking distance to anything you need.
6972110,546105373,10/13/2019,Brilliant location and apartment was perfect. Would stay again
6972110,548353623,10/17/2019,"Paul's place is the perfect location if you want to party it up in Dublin! Steps away from temple bar, and just a 5-15 mile walk to most other tourist attractions. We loved the location and it felt safe."
6972110,552208393,10/21/2019,All good
6972110,553855438,10/25/2019,This flat was okay. We had to wear ear plugs and use a sound machine to cancel out the concert going on next door and people were yelling all night outside. The WIFI didnt work all the way and would cut out often on both our phones. Picking up the keys was difficult without a car and with a bunch of bags and wasnt ideal for a one night stay. Probably wouldnt choose this place again because of the above issues. The location was great and we liked being able to walk or Uber to a few places.
6972110,555149952,10/27/2019,Great location 
6972110,556711178,10/30/2019,"Very well located, the explanations for the recovery of the keys are clear and precise.  The apartment is clean.  There are however two black spots: the obsolescence of the furniture (broken awning, broken toilet brushes too, bed made up, etc ...) Damage, it raises the apartment to invest in furniture worthy of the name.  Benificier of blackout curtains would not be luxury too and it is the second bad point."
6972110,557980792,11/2/2019,"Great location! Efficient communication of check in/out instructions. Although we didn't meet Paul, we are pretty sure he is a wonderful host!"
6972110,559619541,11/4/2019,Perfect for heading to the Olympia. Will stay there again!
6972110,560972894,11/8/2019,Amazing location for anyone going to events in the olympia.
6972110,561966963,11/10/2019,Fantastic location close to the nightlife of Temple Bar. Big thank you to Paul whos a great host
6973928,419554771,3/4/2019,We would definitely recommend Raes home for a stay in Dublin.
6973928,431623685,4/1/2019,Rae is a great host who gives tips for sightseeing and cares about his guests.
6973928,434731910,4/8/2019,"A perfect stay, a real airbnb with all the advantages you can get. You are just at a 30 min walk from the center of Dublin (from St Patrick Cathedral) but if you don't like walking, the bus stop is very close. 
Rae is the perfect host, with a warm welcome, and with a coffee he can tell you where to go, give you information about what to do and where to eat (we listened to him and had a great lunch on the first day). He is here if you need, but not invading at all. His home is very cosy, it was a real pleasure to stay there and meet him. If we come back to Dublin, we'd love to stay here again if it's possible."
6973928,437860256,4/15/2019,"Rae's place is a lovely home with a comfortable bed and all the amenities a guest could reasonably ask for. We were given lots of advice on places to eat and landmarks to visit, we were also told how to best get around town."
6973928,441777684,4/22/2019,"Great stay at woodside! Muraed, Raes co-host, helped us with everything, from the indications for the arriving to recommendations for places to visit. The neighbourhood is very calm and close to the city center by bus. The included breakfast is a great point too!"
6973928,443217187,4/25/2019,"We had such a nice stay at Rae .. Muraed was very welcoming and we felt very well .. Rae's home is special where you just have to spend time in Dublin .. It's all clean,  neat, extremely comfortable and you get many tips and Idden for Dublin .. you have a short walk to the bus stop, where many buses (29 min) in the city (but you can also run in about 45 min) Thanks Muraed for everything"
6973928,444819210,4/28/2019,10/10 would recommend to anybody who wants to have a great time in Dublin.
6973928,445988001,4/30/2019,"Rae is simply ""AMAZINGGG"". He made us feel welcome and comfortable. He treated us not like guests but like family. He gave us great tips for not only Dublin but other places and also overseas! His place is super chill and comfortable. Definitely coming back!!! 5/5! Thank you Rae! :D"
6973928,447792188,5/4/2019,"Exceptional hospitality, quiet sleep (double-glazed windows), good company. Easy to get into town and interesting site seeing within walking diatance. Highly recommended."
6973928,451181718,5/11/2019,"Hands down the best AirBnB ever. Rae and Rosa are such kind people, sat with us at breakfast to talk about themselves and the city, had tons of suggestions on local places, and were just super welcoming. Their home is super cute and fairly close to the city center by bus. Our trip to Ireland would not have been as great without them :)"
6973928,452484148,5/13/2019,"Rae was during our stay not at home but his wife Rosa was very helpful and nice to us. Their home is very nice, stylish and full of art. The house is near to bus station and connection to city center is easy therefore."
6973928,453625712,5/16/2019,Rae's place in Crumlin is a bit out of the way but Rae's a good host and the room-rates are reasonable. The room we stayed in was not en-suite but it was clean and home-like and - as was the bathroom.
6973928,455810102,5/20/2019,"Klasse Typ und super Tipps.
Wir kommen gerne wieder!"
6973928,456750476,5/22/2019,"What an amazing place to stay, the house is spotless and really well presented. The furniture, bed and everything about the house is charming and very well thought out. I cant recommend Rae enough. Amazing stay in an amazing location."
6973928,457926868,5/25/2019,"Rae is a very congenial host with a charming home & beautiful garden. He gave us great Dublin tips of things to do that we would have never tried otherwise, and all were a success! His home is in a quiet and safe neighborhood and is very pleasant. We were there two nights and could have happily stayed more!"
6973928,460112790,5/28/2019,"Probably the best quality of AirBnB is the personal aspect. People and their homes, each filled with their own colourful personalities.  Among the many ordinary bedrooms out there, every now and then there is a host who just goes above and beyond. Rae is that host. We had a wonderful stay at his house. He was amazingly helpful, and just an all-round great person. Our stay there was an inspiring and enriching life experience."
6973928,460851459,5/30/2019,"Rae is the man! Seriously the best host we could have asked for on our trip for Ireland. He was so kind, thoughtful, and genuinely just an awesome guy. From the beginning, he gave us amazing directions and options how to get to house from the airport and checked in to make sure we were doing okay. He also provided great recommendations on what to do in Dublin since we had left our trip open to explore. One of our favorite places from his recommendations was seeing a small hidden castle he recommended (Castle Drimnagh, we had basically a personal tour for an unbeatable price). His house is full of charm, warm atmosphere, clean, and tidy. He went above and beyond for our stay, helping us out in many small ways. We are so thankful he was our host, making us feel looked after and cared for as we were traveling in a foreign country. We loved it so much we even wanted to come back and stay with him for our last night in Ireland on the way back to the airport and unfortunately for us, he was booked. We will definitely stay with him the next time we visit Ireland and couldn't recommend him highly enough. Thanks for a great experience! :D"
6973928,461364658,5/31/2019,"Lovely Home, close to Dublin (15 Minutes by Bus)."
6973928,463528458,6/3/2019,"Rae and Rosa are amzing hosts with an even more amazing house! I can only recommend staying there. Its just a 10-to-15-minute bus ride away from downtown Dublin. The place is quiet, super clean and you immediately see Raes passion for music, flea markets and everything motorized in all the small details around the house. Hes a proper Irishman with his heart in the right place. Well miss the relaxed breakfast conversations an the amazing shower!
Stay at Raes! Its a great airbnb experience! :-)"
6973928,468425255,6/12/2019,"Rae's cosy home is the perfect resting place - whether to simply unwind and escape from your day-to-day or to find refuge after a long day. The bed was so comfy that we slept in every single day - it was just too tempting not to.

Rae was also extremely helpful in helping us plan out our days, providing us with maps, useful tips and suitable alternatives (e.g. better routes, spots to visit, etc.)

The house is only a 25-minute walk from the centre and there's also a public transit stop at the end of the street. The house is also located very conveniently so that you can swiftly get out to the highway for longer day trips.

The house is decorated with a very enchanting vintage feel, which is a cherry on top.

Thank you, Rae, for a very memorable visit!
- Susanna & Andreas"
6973928,472198890,6/19/2019,"Rae is great communicator and lays everything out that you need to have a pleasant stay in Dublin.

House is very clean and has great character about it. 

Breakfast is available every morning and he is pleasant to chat with about his house, life , Dublin, etc"
6973928,475386520,6/24/2019,"Rae is the perfect host. Great value for your stay. He makes you feel very welcome and he sure does ""walk the extra mile"" for you. We had lots of tips about what to do, how to get there etc. I highly recommend Rae's and I'll gladly stay at his again when I go back to Dublin."
6973928,477016128,6/27/2019,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Raes place. The house itself is lovely, clean, and an easy walk or bus ride to the city centre. Rae was a great host and gave us an authentic Dublin experience with good recommendations and good company. He even helped us plan our route to Kerry over a cup of coffee. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend if youre in the Dublin area!"
6973928,489250302,7/16/2019,"It was a first time I was abroad and got very lucky to book a room at Rae's. It's a lovely wonderful place, and Rae is such a welcoming, polite and hospitable man. Thanks to Muraed for her kindness and for helping us out with everything! 
Jane- I would highly recommend Woodside to anyone who goes to see Dublin and also wants to feel this amazing friendliness and cordiality of the people living in this wonderful country) Woodside is located in a quite area close to the centre. Every detail of the house makes you feel at home. Rae, Rosa and Muraed are the best - always positive, helpful and understanding. Our impression of the visit is absolutely incredible!"
6973928,498870604,7/30/2019,Would strongly recommend.  Purchase a Leap card for bus travel ahead of time.  Taxi service using the taxi now app was very useful also!  Great home.
6973928,504912141,8/8/2019,"We felt really comfortable at the Woodside! The house was clean and just lovley. 
It was located near a bus stop and had good connections to Dublin City Centre. 
Muraed was really kind and helped us to find our way around. 
Id recommend it to anyone whos looking for a wonderful location to stay near Dublin. Absolutely amazing!"
6973928,507167827,8/11/2019,Super cosy room and amazing hosts as described in previous comments. Very good place to explore Dublin!

6973928,517349563,8/25/2019,"Probably one of the best places I've stayed in! The house is lovely and decorated with taste. Muraed has been a nice company and has kindly waited for us at night as our flight had been delayed.
I would definitely come back!
Many thanks for this lovely moment!"
6973928,522535015,9/2/2019,"Rae is a very sympatic host, with many tips to share about Dublin. His place is lovely, clean and quiet.  It is a bit far from Dublin center (45min walk for small legs), but there is buses near Raes house."
6973928,525790058,9/8/2019,"Rae is a very kind person. His sightseeing suggestions helped us so much and he helped us whenever we had a problem with anything. As a host, he always gave us whatever we needed and we had super interesting conversations with him that made our stay in Dublin much easier. 
Also his house is very beautiful and thought through in every detail. 
We would always suggest staying at Raes house and will definitely come back again."
6973928,531354416,9/17/2019,"We stayed for 5 days and it could not have been any better. The style of the house is very special and you appreciate every little detail.
The place was as clean as it could be and Rae gave us tons of tips for our trip in Dublin.
We were always offered a good breakfast with coffee or tee and felt very welcome.

All in all, one of the best experiences we've had so far with AirBnB Hosts and can recommend it to everyone."
6973928,532168003,9/19/2019,Fantastic host and beautiful house
6973928,536786978,9/27/2019,"You need to visit this place and meet Rae to really understand why he is a superhost.  The house is warm, inviting and has positive vibes only.  Tastefully done interior and what you see in the picture is what you get plus so much more if you don't mind a lesson or two from the history pages with your morning coffee. 
It's an understatement to say that Rae is helpful and would highly recommend this place anyone travelling to this beautiful city."
6973928,544553810,10/10/2019,"This was my first time staying at an Airbnb, beautiful hse,Great experience. Rae is a gentleman and Rosa is a real lady. Wonderful hosts, Close to Crumlin hospital. Will return."
6973928,545435322,10/12/2019,Rae is a wonderful host and has a very cozy home with a lot of stories to tell. He served us coffee and gave us lots of recommendations for what to do and where to go. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay with him again.
6973928,551533938,10/20/2019,We stayed with Rae for a long weekend and everything was fantastic. He was a great host and the accommodation was lovely. We enjoyed having breakfast with Rae and Rosa and they made us feel very welcome in Ireland. We highly recommend staying here.
6973928,553449593,10/24/2019,"Staying in Rae's house was a fantastic experience - he was very knowledgeable and had some great recommendations for places we should try out, and was very generous with his time and conversation over breakfast. And his brilliantly decorated home was a joy to stay in - stylish little touches and flourishes round every corner!"
6973928,558681713,11/3/2019,"Thank you Rae for such a lovely stay. We really enjoyed meeting Rae (the host) as well as staying in his beautiful house, full of interesting decor! Rae himself was really lovely and gave us some great tips of where to go/what to do. We would definitely stay again if we are heading to Dublin!"
6973928,563247453,11/12/2019,"Best place to stay in Dublin. Its a place you always wanna come back and you get some good advice to see Dublin and the surrounding. 
You can get everywhere easily by using the bus. 
Rae and Rosa are really superhosts!!"
6973928,566034541,11/18/2019,Expect a great place to stay and a wonderful host.
6989429,419045448,3/3/2019,"Party of four travelling for a weekend away. Michelle was very informative right from the get go, which also continued during our stay. 
Michelle went above and beyond my expectations of any host as I was trying to arrange some balloons for my partner for his birthday for when we where due to get there, she went out her way to let me know who to contact to arrange and was even willing to collect them. When we arrived she had bought him a cake to say happy birthday.... amazing! 
The apartment was spotless, stylish and extremely comfortable. We were allowed an early check in and late check out which made our trip even better due to flight timings. 
We walked in to town which wasnt too far away either and there was shops (tesco) etc nearby. 
I would highly recommend this gorgeous home and Michelles outstanding service. We will most definitely return. Thank you xxx"
6989429,422514931,3/11/2019,"Great location and Michelle is a great host, great advice on where to go locally."
6989429,425922898,3/19/2019,Michelle's apartment was outstanding! Fantastic place to stay especially after we spent 3 days in a camper. Would stay again if I ever fond myself in Dublin again.
6989429,427843890,3/24/2019,"Great apartment in secure-gated location of Dublin.  Walking distance to the attractions and clubs in Dublin 2.  Or if youre feeling lazy, a short 5mins taxi ride. Michelle is a great host, always in communication."
6989429,437861859,4/15/2019,Michelle was so responsible host who gave quick feedbacks even if she was out of the town. She really cared about us through several messages.

We stayed four nights, couldnt get a better location, around the corner from Temple Bar, with all its amenities, but an incredibly quiet apartment. It was great to receive Michael recommendations for location restaurants, day tours etc. Dublin is a very walkable city and we could easily walk to all the main attractions from the apartment Comfortable bed and well equipped enough if you choose to dine in, stove etc. We did this a couple of nights and bought food from Dollard, upmarket deli, there is also a Tesco supermarket on Fleet Street, and coffee shops and bakeries at your door step."
6991430,435723612,4/11/2019,"Micheal and his wife were perfect. They facilitated our arrival and provided us with valuable tips for staying in Dublin in the best conditions: places to see, restaurants, pubs ... The apartment is ideally located in the center of Dublin. We were not bothered by the noise despite the location near Temple Bar Street.

6991430,462419062,6/2/2019,"Michael and Maylenes place was bigger than expected. It was spotless and the location was amazing! It was a 2 min walk to Christ Church, 4 min to Dublin Castle and just a block from the action of Temple Bar, Jameson and Grafton St were also in walking distance.  Michael was very quick to respond with questions and suggestions. Maylene met us at the apt. gave us a tour and proceeded to recommend great food options, shopping and showed us a map of Dublin which had hot spots marked out. A cafe located just downstairs was convenient for a quick bite or coffee. No shortage of food options nearby. It was quiet and we did not hear the bustle of Temple bar from our room at night. You can hear the church bells ring all day, I didnt notice them after awhile and they were not too loud to sleep."
6991430,464648909,6/6/2019,"This is the place to stay.  It is extremely clean and in the heart of everything you would want.  They also gave us numerous recommendations on places to eat, pubs etc."
6991430,466470340,6/9/2019,"Micheal's place has everything you will need or want in Temple Bar, Dublin.  We walked most places and felt very safe. When we couldn't walk, we took a taxi or bus with no problems. The flat is secure, clean and modern.  We didn't use the kitchen as we chose to experience the flavor of Dublin's eating establishments.  The flat is in a wonderful area close to shops, restaurants, pubs and the main hub of activities without the noise and traffic you would expect.  The wifi is good as well. I had forgotten to bring an electric currant converter for charging my electronic devices, but with some creativity and Micheal's help, that was a non issue.  The shower/tub was a little tricky for me because I have mobility issues but my husband was fine with the height of the tub. We feel it was a great stay with a comparable price."
6991430,468335051,6/12/2019,"This apartment is the perfect location for a visit to Dublin! We were able to walk to everything we wanted to visit. Micheal was the perfect host! We were having an issue with the washing machine on our last night, and he happily dropped by to fix it. I highly recommend renting from him!"

Very quiet except for seagull calls, church bells, and occasional distant happy revelers. Lots of restaurants, shops and pubs in easy walking distance.

6991430,518283474,8/26/2019,What a great location for getting around Dublin .  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay.
6991430,519397395,8/28/2019,"We absolutely loved Dublin, and this flat.  We used uber to get from the airport to the flat and it was cheap and quick but expect at least an hour to get through immigration. It took about 10 minutes in the IK, but well over 1 hour here.  Being in Dublin like being in a fairytale, the sights, the people, the food, we absolutely loved it all.  The flat was a good size, airy, had a balcony and super comfy bed.  It also had A Bluetooth speaker and washer and dryer.  We felt very safe and it was close to everything.  We spent an entire day on the Cliffs of Moher, absolutely riveting.   Internet was good and so was TV.  Wish we had more time. Dont change at the airport, there is a great exchange place for money right next to the flat.  All kinds of food, attractions, cabs buses and train nearby and inexpensive, plus its very good.  Its also a great place to get some ink we had a fabulous tattoo done at Reinkarnated tattoo, a dolphin with Celtic knotting. Definitely the place to get it done. The washer and dryer combo worked really wells for us.  Top notch place, I highly recommend it, and this was the only host that we actually met.  He was very hospitable."
6991430,526011601,9/8/2019,Absolutely incredible location with even better hospitality! We strongly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Dublin!
6991430,527246151,9/10/2019,"Perfect location for visiting Dublin, and Micheal is a very welcoming host!"
6991430,529040729,9/14/2019,"The Temple Bar area catesr more to younger adults. It is a loud, pub infested, warren of streets  with particular establishments hard to find...crowed and extremely noisy at night. Senior citizens should look in other sections of the City for more sedate quarters. The unit itself was pretty much as advertised,  but priced a bit high I thought considering its difficult location and access. If you order a taxi, tell them to meet you around the corner in front of the Handel Hotel. Nobody seems to know where Scarlet Row is and there is no place to park in front of the building's entrance."
6991430,532294165,9/19/2019,"I do not say this lightly - this is one of the best AirBNBs I have ever stayed in. Check in meeting Maylene was easy and quick. 
The location was a fantastic spot in the city, and a great jumping off point for our trip.

It was CLEAN - this a huge thing for me when staying in Airbnbs. The apartment was simply fantastic, and had a number of nice touches including a Chrome cast so we could watch Netflix late at night, and a hair dryer so I didnt have to travel with one.

Maylene and Micheal were quick with their responses and easy to deal with. 

Highly suggest you stay here if youre taking a trip to Dublin!"
6991430,533334264,9/21/2019,"Very cool, modern and clean in a wonderful location! Hosts are responsive and helpful!"
6991430,536786305,9/27/2019,"Micheals place is very centrally located, and as advertised is clean, neat, light filled, and comfortable. We especially liked its proximity to The Queen of Tarts and Darkey Kelleys. Highly recommended."
6991430,538935560,9/30/2019,"Very clean, roomy apartment. Comfy bed, windows that open for fresh air I loved. Quiet as well especially being in walking distance to everything..Temple Bar, most major sites."
6991430,541574771,10/5/2019,"A true gem. The accommodation opens onto a courtyard, so its much quieter than other areas in Temple Bar... its incredibly central, so still worth bringing a pair of earplugs! You are steps away from pubs, shopping, some of the best attractions in the city. The hosts are thoughtful, communicative, and have put a lot of effort into creating a great experience for guests. We would definitely stay here again!"
6991430,546885511,10/14/2019,"Apartamento muy bien situado, en pleno centro, en zona tranquila. El apartamento esta muy bien equipado, limpio y con muchos detalles."
6991430,551513826,10/20/2019,The apartment was clean and comfortable; large bathroom with plenty of products and a complete kitchen with everything you will need for your stay. The bed was very comfortable.  Micheal's wife met us at the apartment and and gave us the run down on the apartment. Micheal was quick to respond to any questions that I did have. The location is perfect for your visit to Dublin. All of the sights are within walking distance from the apartment.
6991430,553078364,10/23/2019,"This has definitely been one of the best Airbnbs Ive ever stayed in.

The apartment was spacious and had all amenities you could imagine. You can tell that a lot of effort was put into ensuring that the guest has a very comfortable experience.
More importantly, the location is perfect. Youre only a few mins walks from all the main attractions in the city.

Micheal was the one who received me. He was kind enough to pick me up a few blocks away as I was lost and unable to find the apartment. He gave me a lot of helpful tips on what to do during my time."
6991430,556697375,10/30/2019,"This place had it all! Great location, great space, impeccably clean. The bed was high quality and we slept well each night. You would occasionally hear the drunken college yells on the weekend (expected in the temple bar area), but overall a very quiet place to stay. We walked everywhere. We had purchased the hop on-hop off tour and only used it one day due to rain. It was quicker to walk everywhere from our central location. Our hosts were very communicative and gave us great tips for places in the city. We truly wanted for nothing in the space. Everything we would need was already accounted for and when we come back in a couple years, we will be contacting this host again."
6991430,559554619,11/4/2019,Great host. Perfect location. Second visit was just as good as our first.
6991430,562102554,11/10/2019,The location is amazing! Easy walking distance to everything you'd want to see in the city. I was pleasantly surprised that it was very quiet given how close the airbnb is to so many local pubs/restaurants. Two great breakfast places literally right downstairs. I'd highly recommend.
6991430,564583271,11/16/2019,"Cannot say enough great things about the location.  It was perfect all that we wanted to do.  Temple Bar can be very congested but this location allowed for quiet time too.  We walked to St Stephens Green, shopped Grafton Street, toured Kilmainham Gaol, met our tour bus from Grisham Hotel, caught a train to Belfast from Connolly Station....all walking from this apartment.  Had a great time and we were very happy that we choose this apartment.  This was the 1st time using Airbnb and we were a bit nervous...nothing to fear with this one!  Thank you!"
7004047,434575148,4/8/2019,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7004047,441620673,4/22/2019,"The location was great: close to a train station, a bus stop for the airport, a well served village, and the sea.  A conversion gave the property a bright and airy feel.  The bedroom was at a mezzanine level; it was adequate but not big.  Niamh quickly responded online to all my questions.  Thanks Niamh!"
7004047,462840020,6/2/2019,"Niamh was an excellent host-clear instructions and quick responses.  The apartment was lovely and close to the Main Street of Sandy cove which is a very sweet town.  We did not rent a car but good bus service nearby took us to local venues.

The place is very comfortable for two people, possibly three at most.  We had a wonderful time!  
Thanks Niamh!"
7004047,470404285,6/16/2019,"Niamh's lovely cottage made a great base for a weekend visit to catch up with family in Dublin. We were within easy walking distance of shops and bistros in Glasthule, we were close to the DART station for a trip into central Dublin, and we had the views of Dublin bay around Sandy I've just round the corner. The cottage and facilities were all we needed for a comfy stay and we really enjoyed it."
7004047,487659294,7/14/2019,Niamhs cottage is gorgeous. Perfect stay!
7004047,518339352,8/26/2019,"Very nice house in a lovely town. Location was perfect for being in Dun Laoghaire, with easy access to Dublin centre. Everything was very easy with checking in. Would definitely recommend."
7004047,530078912,9/15/2019,"A terrific, stylish cottage perfect for a couple getting away. Niamh was a terrific, responsive host, and the place was exactly as described. Wonderfully close to both the DART and the sea, walking distance to both Glasthule and Dun Laoghaire villages. Highly recommend."
7004047,540852332,10/4/2019,"Simply my favorite place to stay at! The perfect cozy retreat, love it!"
7015349,499996540,8/1/2019,Cosy family home that is incredibly close to Dalkey village and all public transport. Our family loved staying in this home for our extended Irish holiday and Suzanne was an awesome host!

7049800,441930490,4/22/2019,"Ciara's place was just perfect.The location of the apartment is great to visit the city on foot. We had a great communication with Ciara, she answered very quickly and she was very flexible with the check-in/out times. 
Thanks Ciara!!!"
7049800,444128086,4/27/2019,"This historic home is in a great central and safe location. The space itself was charming and our family of four were cozy and comfortable there for several nights. Ciara has good local recommendations, and there were other gems close by as well like yogakitchen above the pups coffee shop and a wonderful pub called the brazen head. The home is well over 100 years old and has some wear and tear. The stairs are very spiral and very narrow. Necessary to be cautious on for sure and if my kids were smaller than 6 & 10 I would have been quite nervous whenever they went up and down. We enjoyed Dublin and Ciaras home."
7049800,445907465,4/30/2019,"Ciara's home is amazing... Full of character. I visited Dublin with my mom and sister. Both of their first time traveling, and had prepared them to change their mindset/expectations, because accomodations are just different abroad. However, we were all pleasantly surprised by the house!!

We arrived late (11p) on Saturday night to the airport. Ciara had great instructions on taking the bus to her place which was awesome. I am an avid traveler but am always leery of taking a bus upon first arrival. However, she had great instructions. We arrived and entered the home with no problems. We were exhausted from 18 hrs of traveling on a red-eye, so went to bed pretty quickly. I gave my mom and sister each a double bed and curled up on the couch. The heat and water is on a timer and works for 1 hr in AM and PM--but we didn't realize this when we went to bed so the first night was chilly and we had cold showers the next morning."
7049800,449312318,5/6/2019,"Ciara's place was centrally located between Christ Church Cathedral and St. Patrick's. We were able to park right in front of the place with the parking pass provided. Once we arrived in Dublin, we walked everywhere as the place is walking distance to all the major tourist attractions. Ciara arranged for us to check in early since we had a very early flight arrival. The place was comfortable and we enjoyed our stay."

7049800,508692140,8/13/2019,"Just left Ciaras charming little townhouse and cant believe we got to stay here in this amazing place.  If you want to live like a local, shop, cook, drink in the cool and historic atmosphere of Dublin this is the place for you.  Ciaras place is eclectic and showcases her love of travel.  We felt perfectly at home there in every way.  Our goal was to experience the city as locals.  We  got the true Dublin experience staying here. Ciara is lovely as a host and we would recommend her to anyone."
7049800,513940585,8/20/2019,My parents and I had a lovely stay at Ciara's house. It was within easy walking distance of lots of the places we wanted to visit and Ciara's suggestions of restaurants were great too.
7049800,520258766,8/30/2019,Ciaras place is great! We had a nice time exploring the city and loved the quiet nights back home. Good communication and 100% would recommend!
7049800,524683878,9/6/2019,"This Airbnb is the best of both worlds. Close enough to all the good sites, cafes, and bars that you can walk anywhere in 10 or 15 minutes, but located on a quiet cul de sac where you can relax and sleep without disturbance. Thanks Ciara!"
7049800,525776174,9/8/2019,"Ciaras is a great host and her place is perfect! Great location, quiet, comfortable. Everything you need. Ciara was wonderful and super helpful!"
7049800,530885550,9/16/2019,"Ciara's place is in a great central location, easy to get around.  A couple things in the house could use some updating (loose toilet seat was the main concern).  Overall I'd recommend staying here for a couple night stay in Dublin!"
7049800,532175569,9/19/2019,Great space for a couple or two traveling together. A great springboard for days of activities. Tucked away to avoid the hustle and bustle. Will try and stay again if back in Dublin. Cheers!
7049800,536177116,9/26/2019,"This was one of my favorite Airbnbs ever. Super walkable to everything, stylish space, and Ciara was the best hostess ever!! Whenever I go back to Dublin, Ill try to stay at Ciaras!!"
7049800,539882505,10/2/2019,"This is such a lovely townhouse in an excellent location. Highly recommend! The place is spacious, comfortable and feels lived-in (in a good way.) Ciara is a great host; quick to reply to any questions."

7049800,553894771,10/25/2019,"We had a wonderful time at Ciara's home. We were lucky and met Ciara when we arrived. She is very friendly and helpful. She gave us some great tips to get started in Dublin. The location is unbeatable... Very close to Christ Church, Temple Bar, St. Patrick's Church, etc. Many pubs, restaurants and grocers are nearby. The house is nice and clean, check-In was very easy. All in all it's all we could have hoped for. Thanks again!"

7052192,429231120,3/27/2019,This is a nice place and location is pretty good and quiet. Nothing modern or fancy but will do just fine for a short stay in Dublin. The beds however could be improved.
7052192,431644094,4/1/2019,"Lovely accommodation, hosts provided everything we could ask for and more! Great location with lots of nearby restaurants and bars, also right next to a bus route for easy access to city centre. Would 100% stay again; many thanks to Jackie & Karen!"

7052192,438697813,4/17/2019,"Great apartment in a great location. Jackie & Karen are great hosts and we especially appreciated the thoughtful supplies in the kitchen. Also a lovely pub next door, perfect for a drink or food."
7052192,441801155,4/22/2019,"Jackie and Karen,
Were great with communication and thoughtful about leaving some staples that were well appreciated for our last few nights in Ireland. Thanks so much!"
7052192,444157261,4/27/2019,Great value.  Great location.
7052192,446758659,5/2/2019,"The flat is really conveniently located about a 10-minute ride to Dublin city centre, with the no. 29/31/31a bus stops just a minute's walk away. We had some trouble finding the place at first but Jackie couldn't have been more helpful or flexible with our check in and check out, which we appreciated greatly. 
We were lucky with a sunny day during our visit and went to nearby fishing village Howth on Jackie's recommendation; the pub she advised to visit there (mentioned in the guest book) was excellent, with delicious food, friendly service and reasonable prices. Dublin was an incredibly friendly place in general, we loved how people were always willing to help us confused tourists! 
We used the green DoDublin 3-day pass which covered airport transfers (747/757 bus), city buses and gives small discounts at some of the attractions on the route. The Guinness Storehouse was well worth the price of admission if only to taste the freshest version of their brew you can possibly imagine - fantastic! 
All in all we had a nice time and agree that Jackie deserves the title of Superhost. :)"
7052192,448506616,5/5/2019,"Booked the apartment for my parents. Jackie and Karen were excellent to deal with, quick responses and very helpful in arranging check in. My parents were very happy with the apartment,  location was perfect."
7052192,450459311,5/9/2019,Clean and cozy apartment.  Close to Clontarf Strand and the city is easily accessible.  Fantastic hosts. Undercover parking provided but no allocated space so limited number of spaces to choose from.
7052192,453605452,5/16/2019,"Great location, superb hostesss.  Greeting and added touches of juice, coffee and bread added to the stay,  Apartment was in a great location and within walking distance to restaurants and pubs.  Very close to DART station for access to city center and Howth village.
Couldnt ask for better in hospitality and comfort."
7052192,457088995,5/23/2019,Great place to stay
7052192,458635434,5/26/2019,Nice place in a quiet area.  Hosts were quick to respond and very helpful!
7052192,460916806,5/30/2019,Great location close to the port and only 15 min drive to city center. Great local tips and restaurants will definitely stay again if driving to Ireland
7052192,464791021,6/6/2019,"Jackie & Karen made our stay so comfortable. We were able to check in a little earlier which was great (as travelling with baby). The location is great, close to shops, cafes, restaurants and the bus stop into town just at the bottom of the street! Very limited street noise which was great. The secure parking was convenient and they also left some breakfast basics in the kitchen which was very thoughtful. Provision of a travel cot also made life easier. A slightly stale/smokey smell in the common corridor/entrance to apartment but otherwise fine. Would definitely recommend this place to others."
7052192,466595751,6/9/2019,"Great location for a visit to Dublin. Make sure to visit ""The Hollybrook"" as well. Perfect pub experience on the first night in Ireland."
7052192,470586407,6/16/2019,"Book this place now before its taken.  We have booked many Airbnb places in the past. This place is by far one of best.  Jackie had some snacks and drinks for us upon our arrival.  She is a great host.  Everything is as shown in the pictures.  Great showers with good water pressure.  Two full bathrooms which is rare to find.  Beds were comfortable.  Jackie has created a book with important ph numbers, restaurants grocery store suggestions. Lots of important info which came in handy during our stay.  The location is very nice. Easy access to bus or taxi. Nearby grocery store. Kitchen fully stocked with needed utensils. 
Quiet safe neighborhood. 
Jackie was extremely helpful and kind. 
We highly recommend this place."
7052192,475404525,6/24/2019,This flat was a charming place. Especially nice were the extra touches like leaving ham and cheese and bread for us. That came in handy with two teenage boys. Check in was very easy with the host living so close. The queen bed was very comfortable. The only issue was with the twin beds being very flimsy with the slats being held in place by plastic pieces. The wood slipped out twice by only sitting down on the bed. It was easy to put back together but I would have a hard time trusting an adult to sleep on one of them. Overall it was a very nice experience.
7052192,481690304,7/5/2019,"This is a well appointed and well situated apartment. It is close enough to the city centre but far enough away to be peaceful but with great services and restaurants nearby. An easy walk to the sea is a plus! Karen and Jackie responded promptly to requests and they were very gracious hostesses. The nice touches of milk, bread and a few basic supplies was much appreciated. We highly recommend this apartment!"
7052192,489127595,7/16/2019,"Great location, filtered for only superhost so was expecting a nice place but was still pleasantly surprised at how nice it was in person.  Bus stop very close made Dublin stay a dream with no parking worries.  Jackie met us out front and showed us everything we needed and was quick to respond to messages.  Great stay!"
7052192,491637612,7/20/2019,"We loved our stay with Jackie and Karen. Wonderful hosts! The place was clean, tidy, and very spacious. The hosts offered us advice on how to get around and what to see! A great introduction to Ireland!"
7052192,496451572,7/27/2019,"Een comfortabel appartement zonder franjes, maar met een afgesloten parkeerplaats voor de auto en vlakbij een bushalte die je tot in het centrum brengt. Voor de bus koop je best een ""leap card"". Een rustige buurt in vergelijking met het levendige, drukke stadscentrum. We moesten even zoeken naar het juiste adres, maar met dank aan de Ierse vriendelijkheid en gastvrijheid vonden we dit zeer snel."
7052192,498117088,7/29/2019,This place was a great home base as we explored the area. We appreciated the snacks that were provided as well as the variety of travel information.
7052192,499939252,8/1/2019,Comfortable clean and safe accomodation well located. We were met by Karen who was very helpful. Appreciated the local tips folder left for guests and the fresh food supplies.

The flat is clean and has all the commodities that you definitely need in a house. There are two bedrooms with two separate toilets and this is good for privacy.
I definitely recommend this flat."
7052192,516431531,8/24/2019,This is a great place to stay - a short walk to a the water and a quick bus trip into Dublin.  Jackie & Karen were wonderful hosts and had everything ready for us.  Highly recommend for a family!
7052192,523804943,9/4/2019,"The apartment is in a great location for exploring Dublin.  The bus stop is a minute away, the supermarket a two minute drive or 10 min walk.  The Yacht restaurant highly recommended! Howth is a great little fishing village, easy to drive to. Free parking on street or in private car park.  The apartment is well equipped and comfortable?"
7052192,526035348,9/8/2019,"Spacious, secure and comfortable residence"
7052192,533334679,9/21/2019,Great location and place! Karen and Jackie added many personal touches to the place and provided great hospitality. The place was very spacious and a great place to stay at.
7052192,534892745,9/23/2019,Jackie and Karen are great hosts! They added special touches that we did not experience at our other stays.
7052192,536813189,9/27/2019,"Jackie and Karen's place was a great find. We were within walking distance to some superb places to eat (the Yacht and Food Room) and were very close to public transportation. They left a binder and tons of brochures with helpful information for getting around, where to go, and what to do. They were really flexible when our plans changed (we tried to pack too much into one day) and we weren't sure when we would be there. They even checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed before we left."
7052192,543277728,10/7/2019,"Great place, spacious, super clean and right next to the bus that will take you directly into the city center. I would definitely recommend this place to others."
7052192,547863850,10/16/2019,"Karen was so nice meeting us outside the property, showing us how the keypads work to get into the building. Once inside she patiently answered our questions, gave suggestions on where the closest restaurants were and how to get to the bus stop (right at the corner) and supermarket (up the road).
The apartment was very clean and well appointed with plenty of space. We felt very safe because there are two code-key doors and the outside is well-lit at night. The apartment is far enough away from the bustle of the city that there is no outside noise but so close enough by bus that it makes the perfect spot to stay if youre vacationing in Dublin. If we return to Dublin we will definitely see if this property is available!"
7052192,551463367,10/20/2019,Great location. Close to airport. Very roomy apartment.
7052192,554403975,10/26/2019,The apartment was ideal and the location was as described. Beside bus routes and in a lovely area. The hosts Jackie and Karen were very friendly.

We had a pleasant stay."
7056916,420313338,3/6/2019,"Couldnt be better situated - in the middle of everything with shops, restaurants and coffee within a couple of minutes walk. Apartment was spacious and quiet with a lovely view over the river and everything you could need. Don and Daniela are lovely and were super helpful over a little hiccup at check-in. Id definitely stay there again."
7056916,422580299,3/11/2019,"Check-In:

The check in was easy because the woman of the laundry shows everything in the house how it all works. If we have question we could go to her for further information, good service.

Staying: 
The staying is wonderful, all the pictures on the websites looks much darker than it is in real life. The master bedroom is much modern than you can see on the picture. The wooden table is gone ;). The bathroom is modern. Everything was clean so thats a good thing.

The Location:
If you want to travel to Dublin! This is the best location, you can walk to everywhere in the city centre and temple bar. The busses and trams are in front of the door. There is a supermarket a block away. 

The Communication:
Id love to see how passionated Don is with renting his place with customers. Hes sending a long message of information about the house and so on. His react on the same day when you send him a message.

Overall:
This is the place to be when you are in Dublin."
7056916,425881781,3/19/2019,"Don was an amazing host. His apartment could not have been in a better location. If you are all about experiencing the City Centre and being able to walk steps to the pubs in Temple bar, then this is the place for you. We were able to walk everywhere around Dublin and visit Trinity College, Stephens Green, St Patricks  Cathedral , and so on. It is a short three blocks to the Tara Street train station so we hopped on DART and visited a nearby town. We also took advantage of having a full kitchen and were able to cook breakfast every morning. The apartment comes with everything that you need and there are two grocery stores/food marts within 100 feet from the place. It was nice being able to walk out your door and immediately start enjoying the city. Don responded to all of my inquiries very quickly and he was very accommodating. Daniella (who checked us in) was very friendly and informative. She works at the laundromat which is in front of this building so she was accessible if we needed her. I would definitely book this place again. Thanks for everything!!"
7056916,428476164,3/25/2019,"The apartment is spacious nd has everything you need to enjoy a weekend away. It is located perfectly, just a few minutes would into the centre of temple bar. Would definitely recommend staying here."
7056916,429950085,3/29/2019,"Great house, very well organised and great location for a touristic visit. Many amenities around and with view one the (Website hidden by Airbnb) of the very few times that photos are not accurate. The flat is more spacious than the pictures and Don a very organised and thoughtful host. I definitely recomend it."
7056916,438306103,4/16/2019,Awesome location.   The apartment was very clean and included everything we could have asked for.  Great view of the Liffey and although close to Temple Bar we did not hear any noise at night.   Check-in and departure were easy - and Don provided all necessary info in advance. Highly recommended!

7056916,471906447,6/18/2019,"The flat was clean and had the basic amenities necessary. It is right above the main busy road so you will get all the noise, etc. Also the cabinet in the hall inside flat makes very loud noises every time water is ran or toilet flushed.  The flat is fine if you dont mind the awkward layout and industrial feel, but not comfortable feeling enough for us. If you just need a basecamp for going out and partying, its fine. If you want any comfort and relaxation, I cant recommend."
7056916,474603437,6/23/2019,"The apartment location is absolutely perfect, communication with Don is fast and very informative, check-in is easy to arrange and hasslefree.
The place is huge with nice high-quality accessories like a Dyson Pure Cool and an Amazon Alexa.

7056916,508085250,8/12/2019,"A nice apartment perfectly located in the Temple Bar area of Dublin making it most convenient to the main tourist attractions and pickup points for various tours.

7056916,511294198,8/17/2019,"This is a great location in the heart of Dublin.  We stayed three days and we were in walking distinct to many of the tourist attractions.

7056916,525148442,9/7/2019,"Whoever wants to stay in the best part of Dublin with pubs, restaurants, shops, etc. around the corner: Choose this apartment! Located directly in Temple Bar, everything you need in this city is within walking distance.
The apartment is spacious, clean and provides it all. In the smaller bedroom it is a bit noisy though, but you will not spend your time in Dublin sleeping anyway, will you?
Don is a great host, he provides detailled information and communication with him is superfast and superfriendly. 
Highly recommended."
7056916,531424165,9/17/2019,This apartment was great.  Close to everything

7056916,537330380,9/28/2019,"Don has a wonderful place in Dublin in Temple Bar. You can watch the tide go in and out from your living room window because the River Liffey is there behind the window, the pubs are near, the shops are near, the busis are near and even the taxi stand is in the other side of the Aston Quai. Although the apartment is near to everything the place is cosy and calm."

The location is a bit far from the center but a bus stop is a 5 minute walk away and a bus to Dublin city center leaves every 12 minutes. Highly recommended!
7067614,427314927,3/23/2019,Absolutely wonderful!

7067614,531809154,9/18/2019,"Monika's place was amazing and exactly what I needed. She was so accommodating about my check-in, the room was clean and homey. It was the subtle touches that really made me feel at home. She had left a water bottle and some fruit on a side table. Those are the things that make me feel more like a family friend than a guest. Would highly recommend. :)"
7067614,532617303,9/20/2019,"l would recommend! Very clean, easy instructions, very friendly and a great stay"

Perfect airbnb for a weekend trip to Dublin.
Near airport."

7067614,562111996,11/10/2019,I had great couple of days at Monika's apartment.
7071476,529745761,9/15/2019,"Bills Airbnb was wonderful!! My husband and I stayed in the garden cottage for our wedding night after marrying in City Centre & it was perfect!
We loved the decor and style of the home, how quite and quaint it is and above all else THE BED! Wildly comfortable stay in the space, was simply perfect for us two. We just loved the greenery and plants in the space as well. Bill has the home bed technically savvy and also fast WiFi which we appreciated. We felt right at home!
Bill went above and beyond to accommodate us. Wed highly recommend this cottage and Bill to anyone staying in Dublin. :)"
7071476,537335036,9/28/2019,The host canceled this reservation 89 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7071476,558891207,11/3/2019,Great location close to city centre. Bill was quick to respond to any requests and has put together an awesome guide of the local neighborhood and city.
7079348,419627003,3/4/2019,"Staying here at Arbour Hill was lovely, really nice and quiet location and in walkable distances to most places. Cal was able to give good information and answered all questions within good time. Fabulous city and a good comfy bed!  Would reccomend:)"
7079348,425458743,3/18/2019,Nice place to stay. Quiet and short walk to some shops and cafes. Quick taxi ride to the city.  Hosts very friendly and informative about the area.
7079348,429266010,3/27/2019,Amazing experience
7079348,430845354,3/31/2019,"Bella esperienza a Dublino. Abitazione perfetta con ogni comfort, abbastanza vicina al centro. Ci sta un bar che fa anche un ottima pizza nelle vicinzanze e diversi locali che fanno ottime colazioni. Ci siamo sentiti molto a casa. Consigliatissimo"
7079348,433352978,4/6/2019,This was the second time I have stayed in this lovely cottage. It is warm and clean and is in a great location. Would highly recommend
7079348,436503253,4/13/2019,"I stayed here for about 7 days during the week I attended Trinity College Dublin for student exchange. Everything we needed (sugar, salt, pepper, pasta, stove, oven etc) was available in the kitchen. However, a few things we hoped to have were brighter lights (for doing work), a dining table and a microwave. Those would be a bonus :) other than that, we had a lovely & comfortable stay in the cottage."
7079348,437775968,4/15/2019,Brians place is in a quiet neighborhood with parking on the street or around the corner.  Beds were very comfortable.  We had everything we needed there.
7079348,439183621,4/18/2019,"The house was lovely. It was on a nice quiet street with parking at the front and a short walk to the local village & bus & Luas stops. The house was clean and tidy and had everything you could need. Cal was a great host & made everything really easy & answered all questions quickly.
We traveled with our 18 month old daughter & I would say it was a great place for a small family. I would happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin."
7079348,446368865,5/1/2019,"This is a lovely cottage, quick walk to public transportation. Check in was easy, space is small but perfect for a small family."
7079348,449343726,5/6/2019,"We traveled with our granddaughters (13 &15). I would say it was a great time for my family. A very quiet place, near to the bus stops (46a - 450 m, 37/39/39a - 650 m). We have got DoDublin tickets valid 72 hours for all buses including Airport coaches and Hop On Hop Off tours. The most important thing for my wife is an exellent heating system manually controled (nights were very cold). Spare pillows and quilts were available. Kitchen equipment is sufficient and made our stay more pleasant. WiFi was perfect. Local TV programs available and nice musical radio channels as well. The total accomodation price for a family with 2 children was very reasonable."
7079348,456676003,5/22/2019,Such a great location and quick responses. (: Our host was very accommodating!
7079348,459369266,5/27/2019,"The cottage was a perfect place for our stay in Dublin! The location is perfect - quiet neighborhood, close to several bus stops, and delicious coffee shops and a Centra close by! We were lucky to be able to check in early and communication was quick and easy. 

Cal was great! Extremely responsive and quick to help. We had an error message on the water heater and he stopped by to fix it! 

Three of us stayed in the cottage and there was more than enough space. The cottage had all the amenities one may need when staying for more than a few days - kitchen equipment, towels, etc. 

Thank you!!!"
7079348,468405749,6/12/2019,"We had an awesome stay at the cottage! It's in a great location if you prefer a not very busy neighbourhood. The only thing missing was a table, because we were three people which the small bar in the kitchen couldn't accommodate but this really wasn't much of a problem. Overall it was an incredibly amazing time we spend there!"
7079348,470667386,6/16/2019,The cottage had all of the basic amenities. The location was great...lots of good pubs and excellent restaurants in the area. It was a short bus ride into the city centre. Great place to use as a base to see Dublin.
7079348,474479942,6/23/2019,"Stony batter was so much fun. We had an amazing stay. My teenager and I stayed for a week. We were a 15 minute walk to the Guinness store and a 20 minute walk to temple bar. They were so much to do and see in the local area and the city bus was easy to figure out. Stony batter even had a weekend festival that we attended and saw some local music and entertainment. I would highly recommend this place. Not only is it close to everything, But it is clean and you have everything you need right there. Their local markets down the street that you can fill the fridge up with. The Wi-Fi was working perfectly which helped with evening schoolwork. We had a wonderful experience."
7079348,480192165,7/2/2019,"Lovely home, close to the city, excellent host, highly recommended"
7079348,484098090,7/8/2019,Very cute and comfortable apartment! Host recommendations are very helpful!
7079348,486948358,7/13/2019,Check in process is easy and place is a good landing spot with fairly good location for seeing Dublin. I lucked out when finding it because I didn't know how close to Heuston Station it was. . . you can walk it if your bags are not too heavy.
7079348,493974314,7/23/2019,The area is quiet and cute and just a short trip into the city centre. Public transport is extremely easy to get to and from the apartment. Apartment size and amenities are also great. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
7079348,511409788,8/17/2019,"The cottage is exactly as others have written. Clean, cozy and very close to busstop or a 15/20 min walk to the city centre. Very quiet neighbourhood. I liked the checkin process, easy way to get the keys by getting a code to the lockbox. No hassle with having to be there at a certain time to meet up with the owner.  The cottage has everything you need, is clean, has wifi and even adapters for your electric appliances from outside Ireland. Brian and Cal are fast in replying aswell. Me, my husband and our 2 young boys would definately stay here again! Thank you!"
7079348,515025296,8/22/2019,"Great location and quick responses, would recommend!"
7079348,522579175,9/2/2019,Great place and amazing hosts. This place is much bigger than i expected the photos don't do it justice. I would 100% recommend Brian and Cal's place and I will defiantly come and stay again next time I'm in Dublin.
7079348,525244690,9/7/2019,"Good location. Reasonable walking distance to public transportation and some of the city attractions. Property small but functional. Living room furniture is worn and tatty, bedding,and towels were clean but stained, and overdue upgrade."
7079348,529215896,9/14/2019,"This house is in a good location for easy walking to stores, Jameson's Bow Street, and Guinness. For a bit more walking, you can reach several other great tourist attractions.  The LUAS is a short walk away, as is Heuston train station, should you decide to arrive in Dublin by rail or take a day trip. The one amenity lacking that would have been handy was a microwave, but there is a fully functioning oven, and an electric tea kettle.

The hosts, Brian and Cal had tips on the area, how to operate the shower and heating system, and a great explanation of the recycling program, with a separate bin for that in the kitchen. There is a washer for clothing, but no dryer, however items air dried quickly, and there are cleaners located within easy walking distance if needed."
7079348,535424463,9/24/2019,A great emplacement (30 minutes of walk of the city) and a beautiful place to stay during your trip! Cal and bryan are very professionnel people!
7079348,538938424,9/30/2019,A cute little house in a lovely neighbourhood. Its easy to walk from there to the city centre. It is an old house but equipped with everything you need. The communication was smooth and precise. We enjoyed our stay!
7108543,418539055,3/2/2019,Eithnes place is very clean and comes with everything that you may need for a short trip. It is also at a very convenient location. She was quick at getting things fixed when we reached out for help. Thanks Eithne!
7108543,421959202,3/10/2019,"This apartment is in a great location, with great views. Booked for a birthday weekend with friends and first impressions were great. However, the finishing touches were lacking greatly. The apartment was dirty, with food crumbs in cupboards, dirty cupboard doors, dusty surfaces in all rooms. Bathrooms were also dirty and taps did not work properly meaning one shower was cold and the other scorching hot. The window seals in the double bedroom had been sealed with gaffer tape which did not stop the draft. 
The host did assist quickly with the broken remote controlled blinds and when we were without water for a night (no working toilets). Such a shame as this apartment could be amazing. Considering the high price tag for our stay, I would not recommend."
7108543,429958313,3/29/2019,Really enjoyed staying here. Stylish place right in the business district of Dublin. Not a far walk to Grafton Street and the Temple Bar areas of the city.
7108543,521676713,9/1/2019,"Great location, in the stylish Charlotte Quay. Very close to shops bars and restaurants and a nice walk to the centre. Chic apartment, nice and warm and quiet."
7108543,540902804,10/4/2019,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7123149,461263891,5/31/2019,"I would 100% stay here again. We loved it! Beautiful and relaxing, Jens place was the perfect stay for our vacation. Would highly recommend to anyone."
7123149,467267798,6/10/2019,"Very nice place for those who want to cook down out of noisy towns. Loughshinny and Skerries are wonderful fishing villages, with very nice places to eat, from breakfast, to dinner (definitely check-out Olive Cafe/Deli). Fairly close to Dublin town, for days visit.
Jen has been wonderful, very supportive! Totally recommended!"
7123149,471307591,6/17/2019,"This place is amazing. The cottage is in the perfect location, with the beach right on the doorstep. It is also a very quiet and peaceful area, but with local shops a short drive away. Skerries Harbour is not far, and there are plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes and a huge unspoilt beach. The cottage itself has a lovely layout and is very modern in decor. The kitchen is fabulous, the beds are super comfy and you can have a decent shower too. Thoroughly recommend this place. We would love to return one day."
7123149,475483535,6/24/2019,"It is a lovely place right in front of a beach. It is out of walking distance from any shops so car is a must but even this disadvantage wouldnt make me not to consider this place in future again. 
Cottage was spotless and all you need is in it. 
Jen is very responsive so any problem you might have is dealt with very fast.
Thank you."
7123149,484608786,7/9/2019,"Jen's place is really nice and is situated in a quiet area! The pictures are 100% accurate. Jen is a great host! She was always checking on us via messages during our trip, always offering tips and any help when we needed. She also left us a loaf of bread on our first night, which we really appreciated after our late night flight :) Highly recommend this place, however, make sure that you have a car as the area is quite remote and the first shops are about 5km away."
7123149,493055822,7/22/2019,Lovely cottage right next to the beach. Great for walks along the shore. Living area is spacious and cosy. Lovely for a family holiday.
7123149,498833618,7/30/2019,"Jens beautiful home is set in a spectacular location with amazing views across the bay. From booking to check-out we had very quick responses to any queries we had, the house was very clean/tidy and provided a perfect location for us visiting family in the local surrounding  area. Its quiet, its laid back and its perfect for quiet getaway. Highly recommended."
7123149,503003925,8/5/2019,Amazing Air BnB! We cant wait to return to Jens house & Loughshinny :-)
7123149,506287008,8/10/2019,The little harbor is lovely and from the house you have a very nice view on the beach. Jen's house is very quiet and even with the storm you don't hear anything. The house is really lovely and well furnished. Beds are so comfortables !  Highly recommanded !
7123149,508067288,8/12/2019,"Lovely cottage, great layout and decor. Super kitchen. Really enjoyed our stay here."
7132062,418099532,3/1/2019,A lovely space with a wonderful host.  Really wonderful location.
7132062,419595007,3/4/2019,Lovely place to stay.  Very quaint.   The homemade bread she left so so nice and everything was very clean! She is a very nice lady as well and very knowledgeable about Dublin!
7132062,421367665,3/9/2019,"Beautiful Georgian townhouse, centrally located,  well kitted out studio let by a very efficient and friendly host.  Just the walk through the entrance hall and up the staircase to the studio is a joy in itself!"
7132062,422564302,3/11/2019,Nice place quite close of the centrum.
7132062,423810478,3/15/2019,"This spot was central, charming, and clean. I recommend."
7132062,425531115,3/18/2019,amazing stay!
7132062,427976001,3/24/2019,This was a great place to stay! It was nice to be out of the city Centre but close enough to walk every where. We never had to take a taxi. The place was very nice and historic. We liked the option of eating out or dining in with the full kitchen. The only negative is you can hear everything going outside if you are a light sleeper. Other than that everything was wonderful!
7132062,430913844,3/31/2019,"Really an amazing apartment, well located with an amazing host. I would definitely go back. Thanks Karin!"
7132062,432250087,4/3/2019,"Its a lovely sized studio flat, nice little touches and all the items required for a good stay, even down to the home made jam."
7132062,435114231,4/9/2019,"Karin's apartment is so charming.  It's at the top of the building, so if stairs are an issue this might not be the place for you.  We loved having the studio to ourselves and we really enjoyed the fireplace in the living room.  The bed was a bit firm for our tastes, but otherwise we really enjoyed our stay in this historic building.  It felt like we were staying in a tiny bit of traditional Ireland, which is exactly what we wanted."
7132062,440084112,4/20/2019,"The apartment is beautiful, bright and spacious. The location is perfect, in walking distance to everything. Karin provides clear instructions and check in is fast and easy. Will definitely come back for my next trip to Dublin."
7132062,441739169,4/22/2019,"We had a lovely stay! Couldnt get the hot water to work at first, but Karin was prompt in helping us get it going. This apartment is darling, and we found it very walkable. Would recommend!"
7132062,444095565,4/27/2019,"It is a very nice location, close to the city center. The room was huge, I really liked the room. Everything was clean, bathroom, room, etc.

Unfortunately, there were some issues with the Wifi. However, it was an exception and they will look into it.

My room was on the street side. Therefore, it was a bit noisy in the morning because of the traffic. Not a problem for me but if you are a light sleeper it could maybe be an issue.

Overall, good location and great host. Definitely, a place where I would come again."
7132062,450117103,5/8/2019,Great place! Karin is very hospitable.
7132062,451278349,5/11/2019,It was my mother and I's first time in Ireland and our stay at Karin's beautiful home was exactly what I was hoping for and more! The location was great! Right next to a park which we could see from our room and it was in great walking distance to access the whole city. Self check-in was nice and made me feel comfortable being able to get in and out on our own. She greeted us upon arrival and provided us with a map of Dublin and basically mapped out all the walking routes for us to all the places we wanted to go. She also provided us with some food for our stay which was very nice. I was just in love with all the character and history her house has. Flowers and plants everywhere! I will definitely be looking to stay there again if I'm ever back in Dublin.
7132062,453296322,5/15/2019,"Karins place is perfect location for staying in the heart of Dublin, lovely old building with lovely touches of styling and detail. What we expect of a town the age of Dublin 5/5."
7132062,453930559,5/17/2019,Stay here. Its a most amazing building and each of Karins units are charming and tastefully outfitted. Youll have everything youll need in a wonderful part of town that is close to downtown Dublin but enough out of the way to avoid the crowds.  I walked into the unit and felt instantly at home and really couldve seen myself living there. Youll be delighted.
7132062,458050723,5/25/2019,"We enjoyed our stay with Karin very much. The house is absolutely beautiful and the apartment is equipped with everything you need: fully equipped kitchen, washing machine, bathroom, etc. etc.
Karin's house is 10 minutes away from the centre. The check-in and communication were perfect. On our next trip to Dublin we will definitely stay at karin again. Absolutely recommended!"
7132062,460089612,5/28/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin!  The apartment was immaculate and beautiful!   Location was great and walkable to all major sights.  Karen is an amazing host. Gave me so many great travel tips and made me feel so welcome!  Would definitely recommend to anymore traveling to Dublin!
7132062,461385295,5/31/2019,"No internet. No hot water. 

The Airbnb is charming and in a great location (though from my few days in Dublin, everything is pretty central). The host was extremely responsive leading up to my visit. The front door was in process of repair while I was staying, so I had to use the back entrance. No problem. Im not a high maintenance guy. 

But when I messaged her about there being no WiFi signal working on my second day , she choose not to respond at all (Of the four connections in the multi-unit house, only seldom would any show-up on my phone and when one did, the internet didnt function at all.) Very frustrating, especially because I had work for my job to do. (I had mentioned this in my message to the host). So when there was no hot water, I opted to not contact her. I will admit this. Initially I thought I had not turned on the hot water heater per the instructions in the apartment book. But no, even with the switch on, only cold water. 

Look, I hate leaving bad reviews. This is a really lovely house, my apartment was clean and welcoming, coffee left for me and even eggs in the refrigerator. But as far as the BASIC amenities go, it was really disappointing, pretty inexcusable."
7132062,463448062,6/3/2019,This was a very nice space conveniently located to many great areas of town!
7132062,464782474,6/6/2019,"Karin runs this beautiful b&b with her entire heart and soul. Her home is a stunning work of beauty and hospitality, and it's clear so much care has gone into both presentation and accommodation. She is quick to help out whenever anything arises and knows the ins and outs of Dublin like no other. She's personable, informative and caring. The rooms are airy, comfortable and accommodating. This room can get a bit loud traffic wise so if you're sensitive to such, I'd highly advise booking one of her other majestic rooms for just a bit more. Walkable distance to close to everything."
7132062,466607278,6/9/2019,"Nice place, nice host, nice touches (with supplies for breakfast). A great location, everything was easy to get to either by walking to by nearby buses or trams"
7132062,468013929,6/11/2019,"Though we ended up not being able to stay at Karins, she was a great host. Quick to respond, thorough instructions and great tips on everything youd need to know."
7132062,484083777,7/8/2019,"Great spot, very centrally located. Karin is a very sweet host, and the place is a great home base for exploring the city."
7132062,486774728,7/13/2019,"Karin is an excellent host.  She provides her guests with extensive, detailed information to ensure that travel and check-in goes well, and to help them plan their itineraries while in Dublin.  She personally took time to discuss our interests and give us advice.  We appreciated her suggestions very much.  Her apartment is lovely and beautifully equipped, and has a charming bookshelf full of good reading, much of it by Irish writers or about Ireland.
The single factor that was less than ideal was some traffic and pedestrian noise at night, but that's probably normal for city locations, and we were perhaps a bit sensitive to it, having just come from the relative silence of rural accommodations."
7132062,491500901,7/20/2019,"This is the second time we have stayed in one of Karin's beautiful apartments in this beautifully restored Georgian building on historic Mountjoy Square. The neighborhood is charming and within close walking distance to all Dublin has to offer.  Karin takes her role as a host seriously, there are many detailed touches, including guides to the city and some basic staples like fruit, yogurt, milk, eggs, coffee and tea. Highly recommended!"
7132062,497348582,7/28/2019,"This apartment is comfortable and unique. It's within walking distance to most sites of interest, and there are some good local restaurants and pubs. Karin provided us with information about places to eat, current museum exhibits, and a map to help us get around the city. The apartment was a spacious and relaxing place to rest after a long day exploring Dublin, and it was fun to watch people in the park from the large windows."
7132062,504201922,8/7/2019,"Stellar in every way.  Art and architectual historians will be delighted.  The location on the Square with easy access to buses to the airport and town make a car unnecessary. Karin's notes on shops, places to visit, restaurants and pubs are impressive.  We took all her advice and were never disappointed. Karin is a knowledgeable, well-travelled woman who is delighted to meet you but will never intrude.  It is very much a home-- quiet and private. The kitchen is stocked with all new appliances and items to your personal liking.  The flat is small but not cramped. The  bath is a good size and the shower is roomy.  The bed is comfortable. The Square is a  wonderful park across the street. Karin's style and taste bring warmth and charm to this lovely 1792 townhouse."
7132062,508832686,8/13/2019,Great location. Steps from OConnell st and major attractions in the city centre
7132062,510042272,8/15/2019,"Very stylish house throughout! The flat itself is airy, tastefully decorated and equipped with everything youd need. Its an easy walk away from city centre, very convenient for exploring Dublin. Highly recommended!"
7132062,512517031,8/18/2019,"Karins home was the perfect final stop on our European vacation. The room was so bright, and clean, and the whole house was gorgeous. Perfectly located a short walk from the city center, with a lot of great little places along the way. Would highly recommend!"
7132062,514046852,8/20/2019,Karin's apartment was a beautiful space and made for an ideal jumping off point in Dublin. The building itself his historic and wonderfully appointed while the flat I stayed in had all the comforts of home. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone passing through the city or staying for longer stints.
7132062,518081550,8/26/2019,Would definitely recommend staying at this apartment to anyone looking for a break In Dublin. A Georgian House with a wonderfully unique interior full of history & character and the location was very good as well.
7132062,519239268,8/28/2019,"The place is in a great location, staying there is like a trip into another era. The apartment is on the 3rd floor, so be ready to lift your bags. Also, the bed was quite squeaky. The view is nice though and I loved the books everywhere."
7132062,520393266,8/30/2019,A great place to stay in a beautiful old building that has all the up to date amenities and conveniences. Karin was a great host and gave good instructions and tips. You could not beat the lovely view from the large windows.
7132062,523690945,9/4/2019,"The apartment was magical, in one second I had home with everything what I could possible need. Real nice, clean, inspiratiomal and cozy victorian place  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
7132062,525791948,9/8/2019,I would give Karin 6 stars but this website only allows 5. Simply outstanding!
7132062,530074836,9/15/2019,"The accommodation was comfortable and clean. Not only this but it is situated in an old Georgian styled house which is famous in the streets of Dublin. The location is ideal as it is close to the centre of Dublin, approximately a 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar (the centre of Dublin), however not too close so that you are kept awake by the pubs and bars. Karin was very helpful with any information and very insightful with her suggestions for where to visit. Would highly recommend staying in this accommodation. Thank you Karin for a wonderful stay!"
7132062,532163736,9/19/2019,Exceptional location ! Wonderful stay .. would recommend and return for sure ...
7132062,534973902,9/23/2019,"Very romantic and beautiful place! Well located. Apartment is perfectly equipped with everything needed including the fireplace. Full of books. Excellent written  advices from the host on how to discover Dublin.  Nice view. ""Feel at you parents/grand parents house"" style. We loved it very much. Please note that it is a historical house - it has beautiful oak stairs ... but no elevator (if you need one).  We had a feeling that we lived in Dublin of 60-s with all benefits of 2019th :)"
7132062,535880465,9/25/2019,"Loved staying at Karin's. Easy to walk to all the touristy areas even though it's a bit out of the way. We were surprised to see the studio fridge stocked with breakfast supplies and basics, thought it very thoughtful. Everything you could want is available. It is a wee noisy, if you are used to city noises you won't notice, but as it's in a beautiful older home the thin windows do let in lots of street noise even with the shutters closed,  we did find it very loud. Karin left us a fabulously detailed guide to Dublin as well, loved it. Great restaurants just down the road for supper."
7132062,536683831,9/27/2019,"A. Classic property, well located with a super helpful host. I recommend it!"
7132062,537906420,9/29/2019,"A comfortable experience, the room is spacious and bright, the kitchen facilities are complete, you can make your own breakfast in the morning, Kavin is very friendly, can answer our questions in time, recommended to stay."
7132062,543157059,10/7/2019,"Apartment was very nice and clean, and close to everything you need.  Great stay!"
7132062,545404312,10/12/2019,This is a fantastic place to explore Dublin from. Some great spots for food within walking distance and Karin has given heaps of local tips and clues as to how to have a great time in Dublin. She went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. It was well worth it! Loved it.
7132062,551499449,10/20/2019,Alles gut
7132062,553487958,10/24/2019,"Amazing overall experience with Karin's apartment. The apartment is really cute and the whole building is homey, bright and very well stylized. Not only I have enjoyed being there but also I got so many interior ideas. :)

Location is great and you can be anywhere in approximately 20 minutes (by foot). Additionally, the small things like eggs, milk, butter and juice that we found in refrigerator¬†were a very nice touch."
7132062,555193799,10/27/2019,"Delightful Flat, well equipped and very central. Could not have been nicer"
7132062,557196741,10/31/2019,The best way to describe Karin's apartment was charming.  We felt like we were truly staying in  an upscale Georgian hotel.  The interior is beautiful and well appointed.  On entering we were greeted by the aroma of fresh lilies.  The kitchen is thoughtful stocked with everything you need to cook but not a lot of useless clutter.  There were many thoughtful touches like very detailed instructions and recommendations and as well as books and movies.  The apartment is conveniently located and on several bus lines.  The downside of this is that it can be noisy.
7132062,560270112,11/6/2019,"Beautiful loft at an excellent location, equipped with all modern amenities."
7132062,561405427,11/9/2019,Beautiful historic place on the north side. Loved the building and apartment. Very private
7141454,484681849,7/9/2019,We had a wonderful stay. The location was great. Easy walk to everywhere. After a long day of sightseeing we took a bus and it dropped us off right by the apt.  Perfect place of you want to visit Dublin and not spend a lot of money on food amd getting around
7141454,489292070,7/16/2019,"Convenient location, ca 10 min walk to the tram into town. Lidl very close. Nice small townhouse, all basics are there, no tv, broadband is good. Nice little space on the back to sit outside with a table and two chairs."
7141454,498867646,7/30/2019,Nice quiet neighborhood. Easy to get to major attractions. John was very attentive and quick to respond to questions.
7141454,513967442,8/20/2019,Visit if you want to have a feel for living in the real Dublin rather than a city centre hotel. Nice space for a couple going out into the town but wanting a quiet retreat.
7141454,517362471,8/25/2019,"The house is nice with all services working perfectly. Very good location, clean and cozy. Highly recommended."
7141454,529779593,9/15/2019,"Location seemed far away. However transit (bus) use was great. The price also seemed a bit high for how small it was and the location. 
Very friendly host with prompt response time. Super friendly & helpful neighbours."
7141454,532796188,9/20/2019,"Staying in Johns house is a great experience as you are part of a local neighbourhood but in easy distance of centre.   Lovely neighbours, supermarkets handy, well equipped kitchen if you dont want to eat out. Didnt meet John but support team sent emails with full instructions. Mary next door will also help you - we had trouble with locking the front door and she showed us the knack."
7141454,551477106,10/20/2019,"John's team does an excellent job of communicating with you prior to your arrival. However, be prepared for a little more of a ""bachelor pad"" type feel. The stairs also posed an issue for my family because we're all six foot tall or more. I would not suggest anyone more than 5'8"" stay here or risk hitting your head in the middle of the night to go to the restroom downstairs. All said, the location for getting to many of Dublin's main tourist attractions is good."
7141454,556692759,10/30/2019,"This place is overall comfy, a good value in a convenient location."
7141454,558830348,11/3/2019,We where really happy to stay. It was a home away from home. John an his team where really helpful.
7155088,422016919,3/10/2019,Great place and great location!
7155088,431037054,3/31/2019,Nice cosy apartment in a beautiful residential part of Dublin. Close to transport links and plenty of amenities nearby. An enjoyable stay.
7155088,457920084,5/25/2019,"Si estas de paseo es lindo, no es para estar todo el dia adentro."
7155088,470546442,6/16/2019,Lovely location and good host
7155088,475399110,6/24/2019,"Great location. Perfect for one or two people who are in the city for a few days. Just down the road from restaurants, and really close to a bus stop. Very nice part of Dublin, too. Highly recommend!"
7155088,492292202,7/21/2019,Great place to stay for a visit to Dublin. Apartment was just as described. We loved the mezzanine bedroom. Very bright and airy. Brian was great and answered all our questions quickly. Big pluses for having parking permits and a laundry facilities in the building. Cute neighborhood. Tesco is a two minute walk. Shower had great water pressure!
7155088,530079185,9/15/2019,Lovely little apartment in upmarket neighbourhood. Check in very easy. Some damp issue in the flat but I guess its the whole building!
7155088,543235000,10/7/2019,Had a great time in Dublin
7155088,546222868,10/13/2019,"The communication with our host was excellent and he kindly added a day to our stay last minute when our plans changed . The publuc transportation was great and we had  no trouble  getting  around .We appreciated having laundry facilities  too. However should you have any mobility issues this might not be the place for you, as there are many stairs both inside and outside of unit."
7155088,547816075,10/16/2019,"Very easy check in, lovely apartment, great communication."
7155088,562042536,11/10/2019,Its a great place to stay and walk
7158785,425515467,3/18/2019,Apartment is nice and big great location 8 min walk from temple bar area etc

7158785,437757598,4/15/2019,"Cool location, walking distance to many attractions. Tidy place with modern feel."
7158785,445505331,4/29/2019,"This apartment is in a great location. We found it easy to walk or bus to all of the sites we wanted to see. The apartment was clean and tidy when we arrived, and had lots of travel guides available for things to do and where to eat. We did have to pick up the keys at a bar around the corner but it was fast and easy. We were 3 guests and when we arrived there was only half a roll of toilet paper total for 2 bathrooms, which was a little awkward the first night. Would have been great to have a bit available for each bathroom for the first night. Overall a great stay and would definitely visit again!"
7158785,449325446,5/6/2019,Great apartment in the centre of Dublin. Fantastic communication from the host.
7158785,452551163,5/13/2019,Great location and host communication was easy and problem free. Good for a family stay within walking distance of everything. Lift provides easy access to room for older guests.
7158785,458620687,5/26/2019,"Great apartment located near many amenities, clean. Would highly recommend it."
7158785,461793755,6/1/2019,"Great location. Large two story apartment within walking distance of many sites. Apartment was not as clean as it should have been and there are a few minor repairs that need attending. For the price, I'd expect better."
7158785,466335284,6/9/2019,"Perfect location for seeing Dublin. Lots of space. in need of a little TLC but all in working order, just what you need for a home from home break! 

Ask for specific directions as is a little tricky to find."
7158785,468741257,6/13/2019,"Great location, neither we or the taxi driver could find the building, it is right next to the radisson blu, and the build has a restaurant called Feast in it. Needs more kitchen equipment but otherwise grand."
7158785,471307417,6/17/2019,"Fantastic location, it was close to everything."
7158785,478120051,6/29/2019,"This was a generally nice apartment in a great area. There was plenty of space and we had everything we needed including 2 bathrooms which is not always available. The location was great, being a short walk to plenty of bars and restaurants. Sights such as Trinity College, OConnell Street and Temple Bar were all 10 to 15 minutes walk away. Malcolm gave us some good recommendations in his notes which we followed. My favourite venue was the Hairy Lemon!

We were disappointed with Malcolms communication. He only sent the message about check in, mentioning that we had to collect our keys from a nearby bar because he was not around, on the morning of our arrival. We didnt receive the message that Malcolm said he sent about what to do with the keys when we were leaving. There were a few aspects of the apartment that needed attention but, overall, we had a good stay."
7158785,480302726,7/2/2019,"The apartments is in a great location. It was clean but needs some repairs-fix curtain rods, there were not enough towels and the ones provided needed replacing so we bought our own as well as soap.  Several lights need replacing. Otherwise it was well located to amenities and was clean."
7158785,498083176,7/29/2019,"This apartment is broadly as described.  It is in a brilliant spot, an easy walk to many of Dublins attractions, as well as many bars and eateries.  It is very spacious, light and airy.

Unfortunately, it is let down by poor maintenance ì things break and just dont get fixed.  Many lights dont work and fittings appear to be falling apart. All of the curtains need rehanging and in the main bedroom, the rod is falling off the wall.  There are holes in the wall behind many doors.  The washing machine door would not open, but we were reimbursed for our costs at a nearby laundry service.

The quality of maintenance that does occur is poor.  As an example, there is still masking tape around doors from a repaint, and the light fittings are covered with paint.

Cleaning also needs attention.  Mould is caked on the bottom of the ensuite shower door, and all of the cooking appliances need a thorough clean.  The storage areas need a complete tidyout to remove or properly store all manner of items left in the apartment.

Finally, the apartment would benefit from a complete set of matching plates and bowls, a few mugs which fit in the coffee maker and some wine glasses."
7158785,504891369,8/8/2019,"The apartment is in a great location, just a couple of blocks from St. Patricks Cathedral. An easy walk to most all of the sights in Dublin. The apartment is stylish and we really liked having 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Picked up the key from the local pub around the corner, where we had our first Guinness in Ireland! Good way to start the vacation!"
7158785,508078786,8/12/2019,Great flat - convenient location - highly recommend. Thank you!
7158785,509832139,8/15/2019,"Nice spacious place in a great location.  Malcoln was not around so picked up the keys at a local Pub, per his instructions.  Nice apartment, but in need of some repairs.  For one thing, the washer/dryer combo is still broken.  This goes back to reviews I have read dating back to mid 2018 . Still does not work.  The freezer is in need of a good defrosting ..  about a half of it is one big ice ball . No way to make ice.  Kitchen was stocked ok. One martani glass and zero wine glasses for the future drinker out there.  Tried the oven once could not get it to turn on.  If your going to be out touring Dublin by yourself these things may not matter.  If you have a family they may. All in all a good clean place to stay.  Just don't expect  everything to be  as described."
7158785,512477521,8/18/2019,"Zeer teleurgesteld in dit appartement!
Contact met Malcolm verliep moeizaam, duurde vaak lang voor er een antwoordt kwam.
Ophalen van sleutel in een pub!
Verhuurder zelf niet aanwezig!
Woning in slechte conditie!
Gordijnen hangen los van de roede!
Veel verlichting doet het niet!
In 1 slaapkamer gordijnen niet te gebruiken vanwege kapotte roede , in de andere geen gordijnen!
In kledingkast zoveel spullen van eigenaar: geen ruimte voor eigen kleding .
Met zelfs in een lade vuil wasgoed!
Ik raad dit appartement niet aan, ik raad het eigenlijk af!
Jammer want de locatie is top!"
7158785,518276430,8/26/2019,Fabulous location as only 10 minute walk to get to Temple Bar and easy to get to all tourist attractions
7158785,532199559,9/19/2019,This apartment has a fantastic location.
7158785,534156836,9/22/2019,"Nice apartment in a good area, but let down by poor housekeeping and lack of basic amenities. Owner really needs to get a grip as at the moment it is not good value for money compared to other properties we saw in the area.
Would not recommend."
7158785,535884182,9/25/2019,"Spacious apartment, great views and good location. We spent too much time trying to find front door. Malcolm said he would meet us nearby but sent us message he is away for weekend and did not give clear instructions to front door. There is a housing shortage in Dublin and building notices state they prohibit Airbnb in this condo. The cable didnt work."
7158785,537955337,9/29/2019,This apartment is in a great location and is a good venue for a weekend in Dublin.
7158785,540322807,10/3/2019,"Malcolm has a very nicely located condo in the heart of central Dublin. We were able to walk to all the attractions, restaurants and pubs we visited during our four evening stay. The space is very comfortable for two couples. Just a note, Central Dublin is a very active place especially during the morning and afternoon rush hours. Have fun!"
7158785,545002454,10/11/2019,"Pros:  clean space.  felt very safe.  clear communication. convenient location.
Other notes:  When we were letting ourselves into the place, there was a sign by the elevator that stated that AirBNB's were not allowed on premises.  This made us very uncomfortable, as we had already paid and didn't really have another good option.  We tried to stay under the radar, and we didn't have any issues, but it was unsettling.  The location itself felt very safe and was convenient to walk anywhere we wanted in Dublin.  Parking was across the street and was $3.20 euro an hour, but with free overnight parking. We were able to secure parking most times that we wanted it, and only had to use a nearby garage once.  We had two couples staying and as the listing noted, the bed was two single beds pushed together. Unfortunately, there was no way to secure the beds together, and as we slept, we ended up having a space open between them. It was like sleeping in two separate beds, because otherwise, we either were cramped on one single bed, or someone was on the uncomfortable crack.  This was disappointing."
7158785,548270892,10/17/2019,Great place in a handy location. We would definitely stay there again.
7158785,555051651,10/27/2019,"Fantastic flat in superb location. It is spacious with two lovely bedrooms, one with an en suite which was great - having two bathrooms and two showers was a real bonus. The beds are comfy and the linens and towels were lovely. A beautiful flat with great furniture (not cheap stuff that is uncomfortable), lots of storage, lots of space and a fully kitted out kitchen, with washing machine and dishwasher. There were books, games and leaflets left out which were very helpful for our sightseeing. 
The location is really great, you are in walking distance to pretty much everything. And the complex is very nice and very quiet. 
Top notch, would go back and would recommend."
7158785,558650974,11/3/2019,Brilliant apartment in great location with easy access to all major attractions. We had some issues particularly messages to host but he was great in allowing  us a slightly extended departure so were able to enjoy our last day luggage free

7162405,425425838,3/18/2019,Decent stay. We were not in the Airbnb for majority of the day so we were fine with the place because our time was minimal. About ~25-30 minute walk to Temple Bar area.
7162405,426499735,3/21/2019,Great Airbnb! Thank you very much for hosting me and my friend Krystian!
7162405,427264331,3/23/2019,"Great location, short walk through nice area to the main city. Krystian was always quick to respond and perfect host. Room is large, clean and bright. Bathroom has good shower. Tea and coffee making facilities added bonus."

7162405,439185677,4/18/2019,"We stayed one night and I would highly recommend.

Its about a 20 min walk to the center from this apartment. 

Cars on the street can be a little loud from time to time but nothing to complain about. 

Hospitality was outstanding and check in was very easy and fast."
7162405,442763193,4/24/2019,Was a great stay with my brother. Was a really good spot to stop and he gave us awesome recommendations for music and bars.
7162405,447316670,5/3/2019,"We had a lovely stay during our trip to Dublin! Krystian is a lovely host, answers really quick to messages and gave us some valuable tips on what to do in town! The room is spacious and clean, the bathroom tidy and moderm and the small area with cups, teabags and the water cooker was exactly as described. I would highly recommend the place."
7162405,448501886,5/5/2019,Krystians appartement is extremely well located. We were almost able to do everything by feet.  The room is clean and cosy and was big enough for the three of us. Thanks a lot !
7162405,449690469,5/7/2019,This was an easy walk to all the excitement at City Center.  I traveled with my friend for our first trip in Ireland and felt that it was a good value for the location.
7162405,454963591,5/19/2019,"We stayed one night only at Krystian's place. We couldn't meet him in person but all was as stated and as we expected, from easy check-in to the room itself, which is spacious, comfortable and clean.
Very good location, just outside city centre. To Temple Bar there is a 20-25 minutes walk. Bus stop is also close. Recommended."
7162405,455779987,5/20/2019,Very nice property. Check-in was very simple and Kyrstian was very helpful through the whole process. Not in a very bustling part of the city but that was fine with us. Overall no complaints!
7162405,458018465,5/25/2019,Perfect spot for the stadium less than a 2 minute walk if entering through the Hogan stand. Kristian is welcoming and friendly. The room was the perfect place to rest our heads for the night.

7162405,460819020,5/30/2019,Great place to stay. Clean and quiet. Located within walking distance to the city centre. The host was very welcoming and friendly- willing to help when needed. I will definitely recommend to others visiting Dublin.

7162405,467988828,6/11/2019,"The room was lovely! Loved the balcony. There's no kitchen, which wasn't a problem for us, but just fyi to those who read reviews. I'd definitely stay again!"
7162405,468781408,6/13/2019,Easy to find apartment! Loved staying there!!!! Will book with them again in the future!!

7162405,472788878,6/20/2019,"Krystian was a great host; very friendly and helpful with local tips etc.
The room and bathroom were all nice and clean. Unfortunately the walls are a bit thin so you could hear the cars from the streets. If youre a light sleeper, that may wake you up at times but the traffic stops at some point in the night."
7162405,473730809,6/22/2019,Safe place to stay but is basic and you need to be quiet as the doors bang and people live there!
7162405,477541394,6/28/2019,Nice private room with a shared bathroom. Host was very friendly.
7162405,479773214,7/1/2019,Awesome place to stay! Right near a stadium and good food and activities. Cohost was awesome too!
7162405,480634150,7/3/2019,"Krystian's place is tidy and clean. It is quiet and well located. There are several bus routes to town and it had easy access from the airport. The cover image is not a view from the house itself, so don't expect that when you arrive. There was a brief misunderstanding regarding the number of beds required. You need to be very specific when requesting this, but it quickly sorted."
7162405,483215423,7/7/2019,"Sehr gute Lage, sehr netter Gastgeber und sehr saubere Unterkunft"
7162405,487581847,7/14/2019,"Nice and friendly welcome. A good experience and I would repeat if I came again, certainly"
7162405,490287906,7/18/2019,This place was very nice and only a short walk away from Oconnell Street. Would definitely recommend!
7162405,492471287,7/21/2019,"We stayed here for one night! The bedroom was spacious and clean. The bathroom was large and usually available. It was fine. The water pressure isnt very strong in Ireland in general just as an FYI. The location was excellent, very easy to get into the city."
7162405,494983674,7/25/2019,Perfect host and the accommodation is beautiful. Perfect walk to city centre with a great view of croke park. Perfect for a match day.
7162405,502043892,8/4/2019,Very nice stay and very clean
7162405,505560464,8/9/2019,Perfect! Good location and value for money.
7162405,508125389,8/12/2019,Krystian's place was very clean and spacious. He provided clear check-in instructions and was very quick to respond to messages with questions. The walk to downtown was manageable and the building is located beside an Enterprise Rental Car which was extremely convenient. We would stay here again :)
7162405,508821400,8/13/2019,Sehr nette Gastgeber
7162405,509981140,8/15/2019,Todo bien
7162405,512199225,8/18/2019,"Krystian's place was great! He gave great directions on how to get to the place, and was very quick to respond. The room was very spacious and clean, and the Italian restaurant downstairs had some of the best pizza I've ever had! Would stay here again."
7162405,521080460,8/31/2019,Nice room with one bigger bed and a small one on the floor. Bathroom is shared and nice. City center only about 20 minutes walking distance away.
7162405,523783057,9/4/2019,"The apartment of Krystian is very functional: it is close to the city centre (15 min on foot), in a typical area (far from mass tourism), above one great Italian restaurant (and we are Italians ourselves so we know what is good!), and clean. We didn't meet Krystian in person but the self check-in was really easy. Thanks!"
7162405,524227056,9/5/2019,"Clean, close to city center (15/20 min walk) next to Croak Arena - helpful host!
Want more do you need!"
7162405,525721362,9/8/2019,Good description before arrival and uncomplicated stay.
7162405,528131260,9/12/2019,This place is a great cheap stay and relatively easy to find - we did find it a bit more of a walk to the main tourist areas than we were expecting but it was nothing major. The Italian downstairs is fabulous!
7162405,533153923,9/21/2019,Krystian is a wonderful host. His place is very clean and comfortable. You will have a great experience staying here. I highly recommend staying here.
7162405,534098892,9/22/2019,Krystian's place is great if you're looking to stay a little outside the hussle and bustle of central Dublin. It was very comfortable and the room provided plenty of space for 2 travelers on their last night in Ireland. It was about a 30 minute walk to Temple Bar and about a 15 minute drive to the airport which made things relaxing when flying back to the U.S. the next day. The room and bathroom were clean. Would recommend staying here if you are looking for a room with some extra space in Dublin and for comfort.
7162405,535337004,9/24/2019,Krystian was great answering an question I had and his apartment is well kept. The checking was good and his place is about a 20minute walk to the city
7162405,537294063,9/28/2019,an Amazing man with an amazing place
7162405,537947331,9/29/2019,"Krystian was a great host! We had access to the balcony and the roof, which was a great way to spend our evening. We ate at the Italian restaurant downstairs that Kristian suggested - the seafood dishes were incredible! Highly recommend."
7162405,539449006,10/1/2019,Great location and Krystian provided great assistance with local activities and eats.
7162405,544066295,10/9/2019,"Very nice place to stay. Parking is easily available on the street right outside. Host is very nice and accommodating. Only stayed 1 night as I was passing through but had everything I needed. Super clean. If you have issue with noise, i recommend earplugs as you face the street and people and cars can be heard, but thats anywhere in Dublin. Would definitely stay here when visiting again."
7162405,544865479,10/11/2019,"Great location... walking distance to the Garden of Remembrance where you can get on Hop on Hop off buses and the airport shuttle as well as being accessible by city bus. It is in a very safe building and Krystian is very friendly and offered great suggestions. The biggest drawback is the bathroom, which can be shared by up to 7 people (up to 3 people in each of 2 air bnb rooms plus host)."
7162405,546930081,10/14/2019,Excellent accueil de Krystian
7162405,547873288,10/16/2019,Perfect spot to explore Dublin. Easy checking. Everything clean. Superb
7162405,552789152,10/22/2019,Quaint and well situated space. Great location!
7162405,555000762,10/27/2019,"Perfect for an easy and fast place where to sleep in Dublin, even if it seems quite distant from the center is easy to reach by bus and even by walking is not more that 30m from the city center."
7162405,555835658,10/28/2019,Good location.
7162405,556330871,10/29/2019,Very nice.
7162405,557158353,10/31/2019,"Krystian was very helpful in seeing us in the apartment and stayed in touch whilst we arrived late!

The room is based within a very cosy and spacious apartment with a shared bathroom. The double room has a spare single bed and large window with shared balcony, overlooking the main road. Do be considerate with water usage, switching off lights and keeping noise to a minimum. Teas and coffees provided.

Pizza restaurant! - directly below is  an undeniably perfect Italian pizza and wine bar restaurant - attentive, knowledge waiters and manager, a warm welcome, real pizza menu, very quick service and a fab selection of imported wines and bottled beers - we went twice!

To the centre: 15 - 20 mins walk. Lots to see on the way!

Will definitely return again!"
7162405,559331400,11/3/2019,The host canceled this reservation 47 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

7162405,563579803,11/13/2019,"Krystians place has great amenities, and in a good location!"
7162405,566025764,11/18/2019,"Krystian was a good guy who cared a lot about our privacy! He has always replied pretty fast and answered all the questions we had.
The apartment was nice as well!"
7162405,567002628,11/21/2019,"Great stay! Kristian is easy to communicate with and very open with check-in/out. The rooms were comfortable and bathroom big and clean. There's free coffee and tea, which is really appreciated after a day out. The location is about a 20 min walk to the south so if you want to be in the middle of busy Dublin this might not be for you. But if you want quiet and cozy it ticks all the boxes! Also, try the restaurant downstairs (and their Tuesday deal!)"
7162405,567729653,11/23/2019,Krystians place is in a great location! The room was clean and cozy :)
7162560,419037948,3/3/2019,"Levente was a fantastic host, although we did not meet often, he was always answering quickly on my questions/requests through Airbnb. He gave me some good tips about the neighbourhood and traveling also. He was very helpful in every cases. I would definitely recommend as a host to anyone."
7162560,420961799,3/8/2019,Great location in a secure location within a short distance to the city. Modern and functional.

7162560,423515666,3/14/2019,Very nice stay close to city center. The hosts are welcoming and helpful regarding trips and plans. Would stay there again
7162560,425851033,3/19/2019,"Good place, we have received many TIPS for trips, food, drinks,...
Flat Is situated about 2 km from downtown, we only walked, we didn't use public transport - you can just walk if you are active, but it is demanding. Flat is clean and good equiped, situated in calm quarter. Few good local pubs nearby. We were very satisfied."
7162560,426556142,3/21/2019,Levente was a very good host and Attila is a very friendly person! The flat itself is quite close to the centre and you can easily get there by bus or walk the way. The room was clean and everything provided by them was fresh and clean as well. I can definitely recommend this Airbnb!
7162560,440176498,4/20/2019,"Co-host Attila was a very kind man, we had little trouble to reach each other while arriving but then it was great stay. The room is nice, clean and comfy. Thank you for your hospitality!"
7162560,441878418,4/22/2019,We enjoyed our stay there. The room is nice and the city centre is in walking distance. Only the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner.
7162560,446871139,5/2/2019,It was really nice!
7162560,453563224,5/16/2019,decepcionante

7162560,456670082,5/22/2019,Great place and a great host. You can easily walk or take the bus to city centre for all the pubs and attractions.
7162560,457492954,5/24/2019,"Levente and Attila are absolutely amazing hosts. We could not have asked for better. Our time with them was a pure enjoyment. They are so hospitable, friendly, communicative, easy going and there are thoughtful touches which made our stay even better. Thank you so much, we loved our visit with you."
7162560,458762265,5/26/2019,I may fully recommend Levente¬¥s home. It was awesome!
7162560,463859387,6/4/2019,Was a nice and uncomplicated stay. Thanks for having me.
7162560,473343931,6/21/2019,It is a lovely place. Levente and Atthila were really friendly.
7162560,474526005,6/23/2019,Great place with a super host!
7162560,480757015,7/3/2019,Good amenities
7162560,491434540,7/20/2019,"I wasnt able to meet Lev in person but Atilla was a wonderful host! He gave me plenty of tips and recommendations which made my stay much easier and enjoyable, all together a very welcoming host! Lev always responded to my messages quickly and was very helpful even though we were unable to meet! Thank you both for a wonderful stay!"
7162560,503025964,8/5/2019,Much better than expected. Great hospitality. Fantastic value!
7162560,513426410,8/19/2019,"Levente is a fantastic friendly host and was really helpful, helping me work out public transport and lending me a usb charger. Lovely quiet room with comfy bed. Probably the best Airbnb Ive stayed in."
7162560,523268488,9/3/2019,"Levente is a wonderful host, which is evident through his friendliness and communication. It felt like he made the time to ensure I checked-in and was settled, just the offer of sitting down and having a chat before he started work was so genuine and caring."
7169104,512134325,8/18/2019,"Beautiful house in a town at 20 minutes from Dublin. The area is really quiet and pretty and there are several shops close by, including Tesco. The bus stop is on the main street; you can either catch the (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Swords Express or the 142 (cheaper than the others) to get into town. The house is cosy and comfortable, it feels like home. It has everything one might need, including books and toys for children. Highly suggested!"
7185702,483098019,7/7/2019,"Thanks so Much to Evan and his wife, my niece stayed here during a recent festival in Marley Park. These guys were amazing we could not have asked for more. I would 100% recommend staying here and will definitely use this in future on trips to Dublin."
7185702,494291360,7/24/2019,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7191486,418534141,3/2/2019,nice place to stay
7191486,419031084,3/3/2019,comfortable place to stay near the coast 3 minutes away from the train station or the ocean view
7191486,426502857,3/21/2019,"I highly recommend this if youre okay with commuting to the city and are looking for a more low key less touristy experience. 

Walking and taking public transport was super easy to do. 

The other guests were quiet and sharing a bathroom was never an issue."
7191486,429267774,3/27/2019,"My boyfriend and I spent 4 nights at Ineses and overall we had a great time. The location is very convenient and easy to access by train as its 30 into town and only 3 from Howth that is a great place to have a break from the city. Very easy transport from and to the airport.
Now about the actual room. We only met Ineses husband once during our stay and he was very kind and helpful. We were in Room 2 and it was very comfortable. However, the you can hear the trains and the noises in train station but we didnt mind as we are both deep sleepers. We only had two problems.  One was the fact that we found trash and used cutlery from the previous person in our room. The other one was that the check in was a mess as the communication with the host and their instructions were unclear. Other than that, I would recommend this place and would go back myself. Its a great value for money."
7191486,447791821,5/4/2019,"Buono, tutto OK"
7191486,450835108,5/10/2019,"Very clean house with nice furniture and comfortable beds, well situated near sea and next to the DART station so you can get to the Dublin city center very quickly and comfortably. Nice communication, we got all the information we needed."
7191486,452913993,5/14/2019,"The house is very near the train station which is great to go to the city center (a trip of around 30 minutes).
 We met  Inise's husband and he was very helpful and gave us lot's of information. 
The room is clean and cozy."
7191486,458768678,5/26/2019,"Inese's place is a great value, as the DART station that reaches the city centre (30 mins ride) was just one minute away! Everything went smooth, great communication with the hosts, we had coffee & water in the room, soft bed and clean shared bathroom! Thank you!"
7191486,502223988,8/4/2019,"I recommend this accommodation to everybody coming to visit Dublin. The location is excellent, near the DART railway station and there is a direct bus 102 service to Dublin Airport. From Sutton, it is possible to walk on the scenic route to Howth Cliff or to go to the beach and admire the beauty of nature. 
Inese and her husband, Alex are really kind people, who provide a calm and friendly accommodation in the house. I feel very lucky to have found this accommodation. Thanks again."
7191486,507207439,8/11/2019,"Great Location. Really handy for the station - really useful if you buy the Leap Visitor card and can hop on and off the Dart and Buses around the Dublin area. Love Howth and really enjoyed the walk around the peninsula.
Recommend for anyone on a budget."
7191486,512129622,8/18/2019,Definitely stay here. Perfect location for Howth and city centre. Nice cafes nearby for breakfast too and beach Walk (if you can brave the wind). Flexible check in and out was ideal too !
7191486,521834026,9/1/2019,"Good location close to the beach and public transport, friendly and helpful hosts. Would stay again."
7191486,524706721,9/6/2019,"We really enjoyed the stay, we can recommend that."
7191486,531826698,9/18/2019,We stayed at Ineses place for a week. Its a great place to explore Dublin and its surroundings.
7191486,553169534,10/23/2019,Great pleace to visit! Thanks again Alex and Inese!
7191486,559520811,11/4/2019,"The place is good located - 20 minutes by train to the city center. The apartment was warm, but a bid dirty. Inese is very friendly and together with her husband they gave us everything we needed."
7192462,425496888,3/18/2019,Loved Sarah's place! Perfect location- in walking distance to everything and very hospitable.
7192462,436596203,4/13/2019,"My colleague and I stayed in Sarah's appartament during our two week business trip to Dublin. After a saturated working day it just felt like coming home. The couches are very cosy and the bedrooms are quiet. Great location in the city. There is everything you need and more in the apartment and plenty of possibilities around it. It was great that we could leave our car in the underground garage.
We were happy to stay at Sarah's apartment!"
7192462,447944456,5/4/2019,"Great spot, great location, great host. The place was clean and had all the amenities we needed for a very comfortable week away from home. Sarah was responsive whenever we needed something, and I would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to Dublin!"
7192462,463524835,6/3/2019,Very close to the centre of Dublin.
7192462,473902723,6/22/2019,"Sarah's place is very conveniently located for travelling around the city. We walked most of the days to and fro places like TCD, Connolly station, St James Hospital and the walks are no more than 30 mins as long as we didn't take the wrong turn. It is also walkable to the Pheonix Park which is very pretty and definitely worth a visit. 
Sarah was always contactable. We had one night where the whole building had no water due to an overlook by the city council and Sarah stayed reachable to help us out which we are really grateful. It was unfortunate that during our stay, the lift was down the whole period. But it wasn't too great of an issue except for when moving heavy luggage."
7192462,484086883,7/8/2019,This apartment was perfect! It was very clean and came equipped with everything we needed. Sarah was extremely helpful and quick to respond when we had any questions. The location was perfect - just a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. And the apartment felt safe since the building itself requires a key to get in and its located in a courtyard that also requires a fob to enter.
7192462,508187486,8/12/2019,We have had a great weekend at Sarah's apartment. Unfortunately the lift was out of action during our stay and climbing the 3 floors was hard work for my husband who has problems with his knee but we made the most of it. Great location walking distance to everything and the apartment was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. We'd happily stay again. Oh and the TV was amazing!!
7193740,418504388,3/2/2019,"Clean, comfortable and peaceful location.  Comfy bed , good shower, WiFi and Netflix!  Kitchen was also well stocked including a slow cooker. Great location- close to Tesco(5 mins away) and on the 145 bus route so easy to get in to the city centre.
Bridgette and Seb were very welcoming and were close by if I needed anything.."
7193740,422481103,3/11/2019,"Bridgette and Sebs place is phenomenal. Truly a home away from home. I was worried about it being a little far from the city center of Dublin, but the bus is easy to access and their place is worth it. Also a short bus ride away from the beautiful seaside town of Dun Laoghaire. The guest house is the perfect size. Not too cramped and it feels cozy and homey. They had provided some food in the fridge like cheese and bread and fruit- such an unexpected and lovely touch. 

Bridgette was the one who checked us in and out and she was so kind! We plan to visit Ireland again and hopefully well stay here!"
7193740,425429589,3/18/2019,The Airbnb was very nice and clean. The hosts were available whenever we needed them and provided us with everything we needed. They were very accommodating and gave us plenty of tips on how to get around and places that we should go.
7193740,431989905,4/2/2019,"Very friendly host, warm welcome and quick responses to all communication.   This space was great for a family of 4.  We had a vehicle, so accessing central Dublin was not a problem, but there are bus lines that are nearby.
We definitely recommend this accommodation to others!"
7193740,434650990,4/8/2019,You'll feel at home in Bridgette & Seb apartment studio. It is well furnished and convenient.    You will also experience irish kindness and hospitality. Just beware to your schedule if you are travelling by bus : it is located in a peaceful and very nice suburb of Dublin but on working days it may take up to an hour to go to the city center depending on the trafic.
7193740,435727575,4/11/2019,"The accommodation is very clean, well equipped and the hosts left food and cleaning products. There were many towels available, hair dryer and cleaning products. The kitchen was very well equipped and comfortable. The beds were very comfortable, there is a big tv with Netflix. Wifi works very well. Its very easy to find and I felt very safe too.  I highly recommend it"
7193740,461338721,5/31/2019,"Super-cute and cozy studio, lots of breakfast food supplies. Gorgeous outdoor space with wisteria and lilacs and fun patio. Lots of parks nearby . 
Lovely hosts."
7193740,463462406,6/3/2019,This was our second time @ Bridgette's and Seb's studio apartment and we didn't regret choosing it. Once again a very uncomplicated check-in (we arrived at midnight) and check-out. The location is not the biggest one but has everything you need including two kind hosts. Definetly a great place to stay while in Dublin and I'm sure not our last time there.
7193740,467508133,6/10/2019,"Beautiful place in the suburbs of south dublin, Brigette and Seb were very thoughtful to help stock up the fridge with essentials and were very responsive when communicating."
7193740,471410343,6/17/2019,"Bridgette and Seb were wonderful hosts! They were clear with instructions for how to check in and had great amenities. The place is cute and tucked away in a neighborhood but easy to access train or busses, also nice little walking areas. If I were to travel to Dublin again I would definitely stay there!"
7193740,473334395,6/21/2019,"Great location for a quiet stay. Beside a huge park if you are into your fitness. Grocery store very close by also. All you need really. I will happily return for another stay. 

Thanks guys."
7193740,484074946,7/8/2019,Amazing hosts. Provides us with everything we needed including travel tips. 5/5 stars :)
7193740,493394254,7/22/2019,"Excellent accommodation, with nothing lacking, and a host who goes out of their way to ensure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay."
7193740,501376077,8/3/2019,"Thank you Bridgette and Seb.
We had a fabulous time in Dublin and enjoyed staying in your accommodation so much. You are such amazingly hospital and friendly hosts - just wish we had booked another night!  With love and respect, The Lawson family xx"
7193740,507141105,8/11/2019,"Everything was fine : welcome, appartement, and it was very quiet. I recommand!"
7193740,510043030,8/15/2019,"Highly recommendable accomodation, very nice hosts, thank you!"
7193740,512504296,8/18/2019,Bridgette was absolutely lovely and thoughtful. She kept a few groceries for us which really helped us out as we had young kids. The check in was smooth and comfortable. The place is really nicely decorated and has all that you need. It was clean and cosy. The location I have to say was a little difficult for us. It took 45 minutes on the bus to get to Dublin City Center everyday which was a little tedious. If youre looking for a place close enough to the city Center and relying on public transport this isnt the best place. If you have a car or want to explore more of the country side then its perfect.
7193740,515760317,8/23/2019,"Very clean and very comfortable, just perfect for our little trip to Dublin to see the foo fighters, thanks again and we will be back as we need to see Dublin again!!"
7193740,535939297,9/25/2019,"Lovely spacious bright studio with really helpful hosts. Convenient for the motorway but located in a quiet street next to a lovely big park, with a kids playground."
7193740,538101439,9/29/2019,"A little out of the way from the city, but nothing a tram ride can't fix. Friendly hosts, comfy guest house--had a great time in Dublin."
7193740,555228008,10/27/2019,"The studio apartment has everything you need in a compact space but still feels spacious. We stayed with our family of 4, includin (Website hidden by Airbnb) year old. We were a bit worried about how we would get on with everyone in one room, but it worked better than I expected and we would stay again."
7193740,562717431,11/11/2019,Bridgette&Seb were very kind and helpful. We stayed there for 2 weeks. Our stay was great. I would highly recommend.
7201340,514050434,8/20/2019,Great place if attending an event at the convention center
7204322,419104186,3/3/2019,"Jean is the perfect airbnb host. She is good fun, a perfect example of Irish friendliness and she has given us great tips around Dublin for food etc. Her house is beautiful, super clean and in a lovely location. The room was very spacious (which is quite unusual for Dublin)  and the bed was super comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!"
7204322,424848545,3/17/2019,We loved our stay at Jeans place. It is a lovely little house. We felt right at home and Jeans is great and very friendly. Would stay again!
7204322,426183288,3/20/2019,"Jean's place was absolutely wonderful. She was completely hospitable and had fantastic amenities in the room. The room itself was spacious and the bed was so comfortable - you couldn't help but fall right to sleep. It is a slight walking distance to some parts of the city, but I did it just fine... While pregnant! You will not regret staying in this beautiful house."
7204322,427885649,3/24/2019,"All the comments written about Jean and the room are more than true. Jean is friendly, kind and very attentive. She gave us many advices on what to do and see in the city and tried to make our stay even more comfortable than it, already, was. The room was very clean, the bed very comfortable and the neighborhood quiet and safe. I would definitely recommend the stay at Jean's place."
7204322,430362092,3/30/2019,"My room was large, cosy, with a large double bed, confortable mattress and much space around. Bathroom confortable and clean as well. Nice details everywhere. There's no a wardrobe but a large drawer."

7204322,434678289,4/8/2019,We could not have had a better experience in Dublin. Jean was so very welcoming and helped us navigate the city. Her home is beautiful and comfortable and within walking distance of of downtown Dublin.
7204322,436476746,4/13/2019,"I stayed at Jean's with my girlfriend for a couple of nights. She offered us great hospitility and gave lots of advice on non-touristic places to see. The room was just as described and the bed was so comfortable. Lots of pubs are only a few minutes away, the city centre can be reached within a 20min walk. Would totally recommend it."
7204322,440165100,4/20/2019,"Jane is extremely helpful and welcoming host! We loved our stay! The room is very cozy and comfortable. Location is great - it's very close to city center, but also a very quiet neighborhood. I definitely recommend to stay at Jane's place and would like to see Jane and Paul again."

I would definitely reccomended Jeanss place to anyone  going to Dublin.
Overall it was great experience!"

Jean is the best host we have every had, and she is so friendly and accommodating that we return to her house every year while we are in Ireland. 
Its amazing value for money too, very reasonably priced.
The room is very large, bright and clean and the bed is super comfortable.
The en-suite bathroom is small but very adequate and again, super clean.
Jean also leaves some amenities in the room, snacks, coffee, cookies etc.
My husband and I highly recommend this place"

7204322,460908169,5/30/2019,"What a delightful home! Jean has a beautiful mews cottage with a well stocked rambling garden.
Our room was big enough to lay out our cases and all our stuff
It is private with a great en-suite and a very comfortable bed.
Jean kindly bought me some gluten-free Soda bread for breakfast as I mentioned I am coeliac- and this was unexpected! We could make ourselves breakfast and come and go as we pleased. As far as Airbnb goes Jean excelled her hosting! She told us places to go , buses to catch and cafes and shops to find what we needed.
It is walking distance to town yet quiet and peaceful. In the city but you wake to the sound of birdsong!"
7204322,474493517,6/23/2019,Jean is great! So helpful and friendly!
7204322,480308866,7/2/2019,"I stayed at Jean's for 4 nights with my boyfriend. The room is perfect with everything you may ever need.  It is very comfortable, it's like a room in one of the best hotels! The house is in a good position: you can easily walk to the main attractions of the city! 
But the best part of our stay was Jean! She's the perfect host! She is very friendly, she gave us precious suggestions and she was always ready to help us! 
I truly racommended this place, it's perfect!"
7204322,485677955,7/11/2019,"Jeans place was outstanding! The area couldnt have been better- safe, central, and extremely walkable. The only time we needed to use public transportation was for the airport and Howth. The room was sparkling clean, and had everything we needed. Jean was so hospitable and welcoming, and gave some really great suggestions. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely recommend Jean and her beautiful space to anyone."
7204322,488696661,7/15/2019,Jean is amazing.  She thinks of everything and goes above and beyond to make you comfortable.  Her room is close to everything and really easy to access sights in Dublin
7204322,491621487,7/20/2019,Jean met us right at 1pm check-in.  She was gracious and offered some beverages and snack items in the room.  She went out of her way to help us find our way to Dublin center and also took us to the train station upon departure.  She provided several dvds in lieu of tv.
7204322,494955055,7/25/2019,"Jeans stylish home and beautiful garden is an experience in itself. The room is very comfortable with the advantage of the private bathroom. The bus station is very close so you can reach the center of the city in less than 10 minutes. The Airlink Bus  to the Airport is not far away - just a bus stop or a small walk. Lots of coffee houses, pubs and restaurants in the area for breakfast, meal and beer. We definitely had a great time at Jeans and we recommend it."
7204322,499412331,7/31/2019,"Jean's place is really pleasant, actually as pleasant as its owner. The area is quiet, safe, with very good restaurants nearby (10-minute walk max) and we loved staying there."
7204322,508163826,8/12/2019,"Jean is an awesome host, tending to every detail. The room was clean and warm and inviting. Great location, short cab ride or walk to Dublin center. Jean was also great at suggesting local restaurants and bars for a great local experience during our first trip to Dublin. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!!!!!!!!"
7204322,512417176,8/18/2019,"This comfortable room is in a perfect , quiet location, just a short walk to Portobello Bridge over the canal to the city center, or to the Luas, which is the light rail system. Several pubs and a coffee shop very close. I couldnt imagine a better location, or a more helpful host."
7204322,522577315,9/2/2019,"Jean was friendly, helpful and accommodating. We had great conversations about travel and Ireland.  Her home is beautifully decorated and the room is amazing, clean and spacious. Would absolutely stay again."

7204322,527161868,9/10/2019,"Jean is an absolutely attentive and kind host. Her house is lovely, clean, and full of little details for your comfort. We'll definitely go back when we travel to Dublin again."
7204322,531813970,9/18/2019,Jean's place is perfectly situated on the outskirts of Dublin City Centre. It's a convenient 10 minute walk from Temple Bar area which has many attractions and restaurants. We loved Jean's place!
7204322,535888504,9/25/2019,"This has got to be one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at.  Jean was very communicative, provided great tips and directions from the airport. The bus from the airport stops about 10 minutes from her house. Jeans place is centrally located so its easy to get around. The bus to central Dublin is about 2 minutes from her house and the neighbourhood is very safe. There are tons of restaurants in the area and pubs. There is a canal 2 minutes from her house which is very beautiful if you want to go for a walk. 

The room exceeded my expectations. It was very clean, lots of towels. She provided tea (tons of selections), coffee (there is an espresso machine in the room!!!), cookies, sparkling water, biscuits and lots of options for breakfast. She went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. Her daughter was very helpful and friendly as well. 
I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place in Dublin. You wont be disappointed! 
Thanks Jean :)"
7204322,541568482,10/5/2019,"Jeans house was the perfect place to stay for a short holiday in Dublin. The room has literally everything you need and all the details are on point.
Everything is very clean and in order. Also the breakfast was very good,a lot of cereals, yoghurt,ham,cheese..
The location is very good, just 20 minutes walk from the main attractions. 
Jean is the best, very nice and kind and really helpful. Definitely recommended!"
7204322,552341536,10/21/2019,Jean's place is a home away from home and there is no other person that will make you feel more welcomed than her.
7204322,557106548,10/31/2019,"Jean is amazing host at such a wonderful place! She went above and beyond trying to accommodate our needs. Nice room with absolutely everything we could wish, breakfast, coffee, tea, chocolates. Jean has shown us around the neighborhood, and Also gave us a lot of tips on navigating the city. She is very personable and friendly. We really enjoyed our stay at her place!"
7204322,559618346,11/4/2019,"Super easy, super cozy, super nice! Great location! It was super clean and Jean was very prompt in her replies and suggestions! Recommend!!!"
7210651,419922487,3/5/2019,"Lovely little place in a great location! Excellent communication with Sean, and I loved that there was a parking spot available within the gated apartment complex."
7210651,420347928,3/6/2019,"Location is definitely a highlight for this flat.  It is right within walking distance to many great places, including the Dublinia museum, the Queen of Tarts, and Temple Bar.  

We are a family of four with two small children.   We fit comfortably in the flat as there was also a cot available for our toddler.  It might be too small for four adults.  

The flat was clean and had the basics in case you forgot something.  The sink in the bathroom does not work, so that was problematic for us.  We only stayed one night, so we didnt use the kitchen other than the fridge."
7210651,422565956,3/11/2019,"Good location, and a nice place for a good price"
7210651,423194995,3/13/2019,Sean has such a great place! It was a great location to explore the city. The apartment had all the amenities we needed during our stay. Sean was great to answer any questions we had and make nice recommendations for us for our trip to Dublin. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to any friends/family staying in Dublin!
7210651,425527712,3/18/2019,Great location but disappointed that after contacting Sean within 2 hours of arriving to advise we had no water in the bathroom basin it was still not resolved after 5 days.
7210651,426481671,3/21/2019,"Overall the place was ok. its a tad run down and the bed was smaller than listed. However, its a good secure premise with plenty of free parking and only about 10 minutes walk to the temple bar area. 
Currently theres a fantastic chic restaurant called variety janeù just around the corner, not cheap but well worth a visit."
7210651,429866828,3/29/2019,Location is unbelievable! Parking spot right out front and off street. Two blocks to all Temple Bar area has to offer. A bit sparsely outfitted for a longer stay but perfect for a stopover.
7210651,432293638,4/3/2019,"Good location in gated community, and security was good. If you are a good walker, almost all major tourist attractions can be reached on foot.
If using Mytaxi App, make sure you have the correct pick up address (try 45 lamb alley).
Host very ameniable, and borrowed a microwave for our stay at no extra cost. Would recommend to young to middle aged tourists ."
7210651,433968398,4/7/2019,Great location! Dublin is a gem! Really easy checkin and had everything you needed.
7210651,435688905,4/11/2019,"Great location, Sean was easy to work with, recommended!"
7210651,437252462,4/14/2019,"Great place to stay! Walking distance to all major attractions, and felt very safe as the apartment is in a gated area. Sean was very easy to communicate with and very accommodating."
7210651,438687105,4/17/2019,"All good and close to centre of Dublin, with parking. Couple of things not quite perfect but these will be fixed. Cheers!"
7210651,439671143,4/19/2019,"If youre looking for a clean place in a great location with a super helpful, responsive host then stay here! Sean was helpful and a speedy communicator. The flat is in the best location with plenty of restaurants, bars, shops and markets around. We would definitely stay here again!"
7210651,441769350,4/22/2019,Seans place was everything that we needed for our girls trip to Dublin! The sofa bed in the main living area is a great addition to sleep extra people and very comfortable. Sean was very easy to communicate with and answer any questions that we had. The place is in a great location - short walk to the heart of the city and it is in a small gated area which is a nice added safety feature. I would highly recommend Seans place! Great value.
7210651,443205517,4/25/2019,Great location!
7210651,444626322,4/28/2019,"The Best Apartment, The Best Location!!!!
I recommend 100%
Thanks Sean!!!"
7210651,446443334,5/1/2019,"Location, location, location...this is the best! Plus free parking!
Sean was very helpful at check in. The place is clean.
However, both the bed and sofa bed are very hard. Also, what I assume is the hot water heater in the closet in the hallway makes a very loud noise anytime someone flushes the toilet or uses the shower."
7210651,452524726,5/13/2019,Great central location with easy bus/taxi service. The people we interacted with from food service to tourist hot spots were all fantastic. A very tourist friendly town and from what we kept hearing - the weather was perfect!
7210651,454052952,5/17/2019,"Items of note: unit contains nespresso machine and a French press for coffee! Kettle for hot water. Stove and small oven. Microwave. Fridge. Clothes washer/dryer in one appliance. Hairdryer. Iron and Board.  Plenty of soaps, shampoo, etc appear to be left by previous guests. Pleasant surprise!"
7210651,456736293,5/22/2019,Recomendo
7210651,459389249,5/27/2019,A parking spot included for this apartment in a lovely neighborhood. Comfortable bed in a small bedroom. Enjoyed the living area and greatly appreciated the washer/dryer
7210651,461800296,6/1/2019,I'm going to echo everyone else: this location is superb. Walking distance to pretty much all the Dublin highlights. The apartment itself was very nice too. Would definitely stay here again.
7210651,472322822,6/19/2019,"Overall this place is A+. What you see is exactly what you get. 2 of us were here for 6 nights comfortably. Laundry and full kitchen was a great asset. Awesome location and never felt unsafe. Very easy to communicate with Sean during booking, before arrival and during stay. 10/10 recommend."
7210651,473730450,6/22/2019,"Sean's apartment is a lovely place - perfect for a family or anyone wanting 2 private sleeping areas.  Sparkling clean, tastefully furnished, and very comfortable..  The location is great - right by Christ's Church, so in walking distance fro everything, but not in the tourist thicket.  Sean was very helpful and made checking in and out very easy."
7210651,476093898,6/25/2019,"Seans place was a great find for us. We have two kids, one in a travel cot, and the space worked well for us. I slept in the bed with our oldest and my husband slept on pull out couch to be closer to the baby. Both bed and couch were comfortable. The best part of this flat is the location. We stepped out the door to the right and had easy access to temple bar area, the brazen head (ate there the first evening -5 min walk) and other tourist sites. Had lunch at Queen of Tarts-very yummy. Ten minutes to the left is Guinness. We used the bus to get to Bray for a day. But, if you dont plan to leave Dublin you wouldnt need a bus if you stay here. A couple people said the location wasnt the safest but we had no problem. We were not out after dark, but the building is gated for extra security. The second best thing about the place is how well it is stocked. It had extra sheets/pillows. Kitchen stuff, etc...  washer/dryer comes in handy when traveling with little kids. Nice spot for shoes and stuff inside locker door but not yet in living room. We would stay here again!"
7210651,476524120,6/26/2019,Sean is lovely; great place
7210651,478061663,6/29/2019,"Great location, great value! Would recommend!"
7210651,484756501,7/9/2019,"Great location, close to both Temple Bar area and the Guinness Storehouse. Sean was super helpful and gave us a good run down of the best spots to go."
7210651,487606232,7/14/2019,"Although this apartment was in a great location, there could have been better upkeep. We found mold in several places and the overall apartment had a musty smell."
7210651,496455601,7/27/2019,You will not get a better location here. You're minutes away from all of the good tourist stops in Dublin but far enough away from City Centre that you can sleep at night.  Sean is a very responsive host and can answer any question you need. The apartment is on the small side but perfect if you plan on only using it as home base in between adventures.
7210651,502195449,8/4/2019,Seans place has amazing proximity to everything we needed - so much so that the only transport we paid for was the Airport Express bus in and out.  There were some minor items inside the unit that require some TLC but the location far outweighed any slight tweaks.
7210651,513326130,8/19/2019,Absolutely great location! Sean let me check-in early as my flight got in early in the morning. My sister took the bedroom and I had the pull out couch which was very comfortable. Sean was responsive right away with any questions I had and fixed a burnt out light bulb right away. You can literally walk to everything from here but the immediate area is very quiet and felt very safe. The Spar right on the corner is very convenient as well.
7210651,515129229,8/22/2019,"Great location, safe and lots of places in walking distance"
7210651,522528531,9/2/2019,Sean is a great guy and was super helpful on giving us tips on what is around the apartment to see and do. Great location!
7210651,526045169,9/8/2019,Great location; about a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and Guinness. Very close to public transportation as well.  We took the airlink to/from the airport and it was seamless.  The apartment was cozy and check-in and out was very easy.
7210651,528021708,9/12/2019,"Sean's place was absolutely ideal for my party of 3. As central and secure as can be, very little street noise considering the location. Fantastic value for being halfway between the Guinness Storehouse and Temple Bar for those so inclined. Hoping to return when next back in town for a gig. Vicar Street just a stone's throw away."
7210651,532193843,9/19/2019,"This Airbnb was an amazing location! Walking distance to all the top tourist attractions and stores, including grocery stores. Really appreciated the locked facility, the area felt safe. Host was very accommodating with early arrivals! Some negatives..the beds were not very comfortable and there was some issues with the cleanliness of the bathroom. Overall, a good stay!"
7210651,534056317,9/22/2019,"Sean is an amazing host.  Prompt responses, very flexible, excellent recommendations, clean and well located space.  Short walk to a lot of local sights.  We would stay again if we ever come to Dublin."
7210651,537293253,9/28/2019,"Sean's place is in a terrific location. All the major sites in Dublin are easily walkable. The few times we called, a taxi arrived in minutes. We took the Aerobus from the airport, and it has a stop just a couple of blocks away. The condo is secure, quiet, and clean. There are nice restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We spent a week at the place and enjoyed every day there. I don't we could have found a better place in the city."
7210651,539501022,10/1/2019,"Sean's  place  was a wonderful place to stay for three of us.  The inens are so clean and comfortable. Kitchen  is very convenient.   The location is great. We could walk  to everyplace we want to see in Dublin.  It is also a very safe place.    Since I lost internet access in Ireland,  I worried about  check-in. But Sean soon arranged his helper to came and helped us for check-in.  
We  recommend  Sean's place for anyone who want to explore Dublin!"
7210651,542291543,10/6/2019,"Nice flat, very well connected. Very easy to interact with Sean who was always ready to help and find solutions!"
7210651,544450281,10/10/2019,"Great location!
Parking space is a big bonus.

Had a great stay"
7210651,546006391,10/13/2019,"Good location from the city center, very friendly owner who is willing to give you the tips of the city. Location excellent for a couple when you are mainly visiting to see the city and not spend too much time in the house."
7210651,562102071,11/10/2019,"Amazing location, walking distance to most tourist attractions and cute coffee shops and the oldest pub in Dublin."
7213049,421379838,3/9/2019,"We loved this flat! So different, and in a wonderful area. We were closer to everything than we thought! A small space, but just fine for our family of four...and had the neatest little details. This was a fun addition to our trip! Thank you!!"
7213049,426509690,3/21/2019,"Very clean, and awesome experience"
7213049,428508337,3/25/2019,Leuke Airbnb op een top lokatie.
7213049,431027807,3/31/2019,A beautiful space not far from the centre! Would highly recommend!
7213049,432266456,4/3/2019,"This is a great house in a central part of Dublin! Once you arrive you are instantly comfortable. The fireplace was so cozy! We are a small family with a 7yo and had no trouble during our stay. There was a mix-up in the schedule and the house hadnt been cleaned before our arrival, but Michael made sure to get it taken care of right away. We were very appreciative of the care that went into our stay. A major bonus for me was the amazing shower, it worked great and provided much needed rejuvenation! 
Highly recommend staying here."
7213049,434062395,4/7/2019,"Thanks for creating that marvellous apartment full of light, we felt like home, esp. after heating the batteries and fireplace. Excellent location, everything in walking distance."
7213049,442371871,4/23/2019,"Absolutely awesome place, Micheal was a great host, super accommodating and the place is also walking distance from anything you need. Definitely would recommend staying here short or long stay "
7213049,443647593,4/26/2019,Die Wohnung liegt sehr ruhig und nicht weit vom Zentrum entfernt.Sie ist weiter zu empfehlen.
7213049,445994534,4/30/2019,"The apartment was very well located and a very pleasant place to stay. The space was clean and accommodated 4 travelers comfortably and we especially loved having a fireplace in the home. The second bedroom does get to be a bit stuffy as there is little circulation in that room but it was easy to freshen up the second floor by opening the patio door. Overall, an excellent choice for our visit to Ireland to experience Dublin and its charms!"
7213049,447314257,5/3/2019,We had a great time at Micheals place! He was very responsive and helpful. The home had everything we expected and included a booklet with history of the home and great recommendations.
7213049,455223787,5/19/2019,"This place was great! It was so unique, clean and comfortable and we had everything we needed. The hosts are fantastic and it was within a 10-20 min walk to most of the popular attractions. It is also less than a half hour away from the airport."
7213049,456285318,5/21/2019,"Perfect place! Walking distance to everything you would want to see. Exceptionally clean, and cleverly appointed.  Michael responded to all our questions, both ahead of and during our stay. The glass floored hallway is fabulous! There is a interesting book describing how this little house came to be; if you stay here, please read it. If we are back in Dublin, we will stay here again!"
7213049,469357684,6/14/2019,"Location was absolutely perfect, home felt very comfortable and safe, lovely neighbors, overall a wonderful time."
7213049,470675890,6/16/2019,"A creatively-designed space that is flooded with light and is very private, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the nearby cafes and being able to walk everywhere. We had a lovely time and would recommend it to everyone."
7213049,472346394,6/19/2019,Great location!
7213049,479743256,7/1/2019,Really great place within walking distance to many places within Dublin. A little tricky to find initially but check in was seamless and the hosts were lovely. Would defiantly recommend!
7213049,481110189,7/4/2019,Michael's place is wonderful! It's within easy walking of many places. Comfortable beds with extra pillows (my husband thanks you). We would definitely stay again!
7213049,483288815,7/7/2019,"This place is gorgeous! The use of space is brilliant and although its small it didnt feel it with four adults in. The location is perfect, only a ten minute walk to the river. Michael was so helpful and accommodating. Would highly recommend a stay here if youre visiting Dublin. Thanks, Michael!"
7213049,485772746,7/11/2019,"Great location, clean space and very stylish! Michael was super nice and very prompt if I had any questions. Would recommend to anyone especially if location is big for you! My sister and I walked to most places which was very nice!"
7213049,491574562,7/20/2019,"Great stylish place in an interesting location. Just around the corner from a bit of everything. My friend and I had a short stay but it was perfect to explore Dublin and recharge batteries at night.

Such a treat to stay in a design haven. We come from Copenhagen so appreciated the style.

Highly recommend"
7213049,500514684,8/2/2019,We enjoyed our time in this cute little town house - great design features. It was maybe a little small for our family of four with suitcases.
7213049,503082606,8/5/2019,"Tolle Lage, sauber und super Gastgeber"
7213049,512442940,8/18/2019,Sadly the house was not as clean as we expect it. There were dirty sheets with some yellow spots and not enough towels. It looks a little chaotic to us.
7213049,516313162,8/24/2019,"Well equipped house in a quiet location, at a walking distance from everything."
7213049,522504644,9/2/2019,"This place was so cool! Loved the unique hallway, staircase, and indoor/outdoor patio. The location was great and very close to St. Patricks Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral and the Guinness Storehouse so we were able to walk everywhere.  Even Trinity College is walkable from here (about 30 min). It was definitely snug for four adults but it really doesnt matter when youre spending all your time out and about. My partner and I slept on the pullout couch while his parents had the realù bed and to be honest I slept like a rock! We didnt have a car so not sure how easy parking would be but wifi was great."
7213049,524239744,9/5/2019,"A light,airy and comfortable home - good location for the city centre approx 10 min walk."
7213049,526783531,9/9/2019,This was our first experience using Airbnb and it exceeded our expectations.  Nicely designed home for a short or long visit to the city.  We found it easy to get to with plenty of available parking.  Great location within walking distance to great restaurants and all attractions.
7213049,527680782,9/11/2019,Nice place. Conveniently located to downtown and popular points of interest.
7213049,530005512,9/15/2019,"So glad we found this beautiful space! Right downtown and close to everything, lovely home. Thanks again!"
7213049,532801201,9/20/2019,We had a great stay at this lovely house. We really liked its fantastic architecture and felt very comfortable. The location was really quiet and we had just a short way to City Centre. We can absolutely recommend!
7213049,533936552,9/22/2019,Cute space and good location!
7213049,535347747,9/24/2019,Walking distance and a stylish setting.  We loved the fireplace and the architect plans and excavation materials were really interesting.  Its a hidden gem!
7213049,538902844,9/30/2019,"This home is in an absolutely perfect location to explore Dublin by foot. We parked our car on arrival and didn't need it again until the day we left. We stayed 4 nights and loved it. It was super clean. We loved the fireplace at night. It has everything you need for a great stay. Michael was super helpful. We loved his guidebook and learning about how he created his architectural masterpiece in such a small space. One of our favorite pubs, The Liberty Bell, was a super short walk away. We ducked in there our first evening because of the rain, and it ended up being one of our favorites during our stay."
7213049,539912046,10/2/2019,Great place and location.
7213049,542375737,10/6/2019,"Great accomodation, clean, space oriented, glass floor and roof (nice idea and a lot of light). Quiet area, 15 min walk to the city centre, 10 min walk to Jameson distilery :)"
7213049,545435719,10/12/2019,"Unusual but attractive and generally functional space in a nice townhouse enclave/neighborhood.  Within walking distance (a mile and a half or less) to almost everything most people might be interested in.  Downstairs living room is a bit small, but we never got in before midnight so had little use for it.   (If you're in Dublin and get in before midnight then you might want to consider a different destination--say Lourdes or the Vatican--the next time you travel.) There's a gas fireplace in addition to a central heating system to shed the morning chill.  Kitchen was quite functional, although I'd have killed for a drip multi cup coffee maker.  Would definitely recommend to friends."
7213049,548357890,10/17/2019,Great location and comfortable space!
7268735,426191413,3/20/2019,"Apartment is certainly nice but not what I expected. The furniture is different than the photos (and not as nice). The corner suite is next to a major construction site, which actually creates a terrible view. The apartment is located in a very isolated part of town. Great restaurants within a 10 minute walk but the building itself is empty. When I mentioned to the host that there was a homeless person sleeping outside both nights I was there, his response was, ""I prefer not to get involved with these things."""
7268735,453604119,5/16/2019,"The apartment is outstanding.  Key points:
-Lovely balcony deck view or quay
-Easy check-in and out
-Clean and modern
-Lots of amenities inside
-Comfortable beds and nice linens
-Easy access and convenient to city
-Great restaurants nearby

Some have mentioned there is a construction zone next door but hours of construction are very limited and reasonable.  I would not say it will detract from your enjoyment of the space.  The noise is not bad and it appears construction work will be done very soon."
7268735,532068143,9/19/2019,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7268735,541450508,10/5/2019,"Exactly as described, great location and great host."
7269130,425530153,3/18/2019,The location is excellent and convenient to public transport.  I would stay there again if I came back to visit.
7269130,427979117,3/24/2019,"Beautiful location and nice view, but a very noisy floor that is shared with two other airbnb rooms. So it might be a single room, but I experienced it more as a hostel in terms of noise. Facilities were alright."
7269130,432984891,4/5/2019,"An excellent place next to the airport and train. Theres a beautiful beach, witch has amazing view."
7269130,435071630,4/9/2019,"Excellent location. Right on the dart line which, makes commuting easy. The 102 bus is right outside the dart station and it takes you to and from the airport.
A few downsides is that the place appears to be a run down and it was very cold inside. Value and price wise was okay, but there are better places in Dublin. You get what you pay for."
7269130,440200912,4/20/2019,"Nice place to stay. Very good idea to paint the house in blue. Easy to find. From the single-bed room a view to the sea. 

A 3 minute walk to train and bus station. Supermarket 15 minutes away. You can go to the City by dart (train)."
7269130,451264816,5/11/2019,Great comfortable stay!
7269130,461743162,6/1/2019,"Inese's house is easily accessible by DART or bus, and local amenities like a supermarket are just a short walking distance away. The single room is spotless, has a comfortable bed and a lovely view of the sea. You will find a great place for a short stay on the East coast of Dublin."
7269130,473854230,6/22/2019,Es un lugar imperdible e impecable
7269130,477415541,6/28/2019,Enjoyed my stay with Inese and she was very friendly and the house is in a lovely location
7269130,478759246,6/30/2019,"I would recommend this place if you will have a rental car while you are in Ireland. I didn't have one so I was planning on using the public bus system. The bus to get to Dublin or Howth is a 15 minute walk and then to Dublin is about a 45 minute ride. The bus that is straight across from the house is the 102 which is a private company, city bus passes don't work, that runs to the airport. On one morning I was doing a tour but it left around 7am and I had to take a taxi to that because the buses went running yet, just an fyi, that one is my bad I should have checked. But all that said once I finally got to the house everything was set up as was sent in the instructions. Check in was super easy. The room was clean and comfy. I could see the ocean inbetween the houses that were across the street. And the WiFi was fairly easy to connect to and had a strong connection."
7269130,497184365,7/28/2019,"Very good location, friendly hosts, beautiful Ireland"
7269130,500475560,8/2/2019,Perfect for working in dublin
7269130,524714942,9/6/2019,"Inese's accommodation is one of the best options if you want to stay near nature and to have a nice walk at the seaside every morning and afternoon. You can find all the services nearby. If you want to do a really amazing trip, start your trip walking from Inese's house along the scenic route to the cliffs of Howth. If you have the chance like I had you can see seals fishing their food in the sea. So try it, and enjoy yourself in Dublin with a good pint of Guiness."
7269130,547976655,10/16/2019,Very comfortable beds
7269130,557575864,11/1/2019,"Great place to stay, close to main attractions and train into city centre. Highly recommend!"
7269423,439601893,4/19/2019,"Elaine's airbnb is perfectly located in the city center. Well isolated from the outside, it also offers a quiet environment to rest if needed. The apartement is well furnished with all the required amenities to feel like home! I definitely recommend it."
7269423,455783915,5/20/2019,"Elaine and her husband Con were true super hosts, they were very helpful and accommodating during our stay. The flat was perfect, had everything we need and the location couldn't have been better. Thank you :)"
7276073,419580069,3/4/2019,"Great location, perfect size for our need (three guys using it mainly for sleeping). Only bad part was the toilet, which had bad flow and was easily clogged."
7276073,421943237,3/10/2019,Fantastic location and lovely apartment. Malcom was great with letting us check in earlier and allowing us to check out later. Thank you for a lovely stay.
7276073,428549808,3/25/2019,Excellent location
7276073,434667283,4/8/2019,"≈öwietnia lokalizacja, brak bezpo≈õredniego kontaktu z w≈Ça≈õcicielem. Warunki do≈õƒá dobre."
7276073,448575570,5/5/2019,Great location and super helpful host!
7276073,451951777,5/12/2019,"The apartment needs a deep cleaning. The photos look great, but do not reflect the actual state of the apartment. All closets are full with clothes, objects and dirty towels of somebody that probably lives there sometimes. The kitchen is a chaos. There was only 1 knife in an apartment with 4 beds. The TV doesnt work. The rooms are full with spiderwebs. The bathroom has stains everywhere. I expected a bit more for $200. $200 is probably cheap for an apartment for 4, but That is no justification for delivering a dirty apartment. We had a great time in Dublin, luckily not having to spend it in the apartment, one night there was a party somewhere, or maybe it was Mulligans pub. I was dead tired, so I slept,  but there wasa lot of noise. Malcolms responses are friendly, but he did not respond when I asked where to get the key.. stressed me out. In the end my mom called him to get response.  Kisses to everyone!"
7276073,457469276,5/24/2019,"The apartment is spacious and has a great location in Dublin.  It is a bit shabby, but clean and neat with good tips for travelers and an adequate kitchen.  It could use a new doble mattress and new linens.  Malcolm did not always respond as quickly as I would have liked and didn't follow through with helping us make a duplicate set of keys, necessary because there is only one set of keys, however he was very polite."
7276073,458574278,5/26/2019,"The flat was in a super location and was clean and well presented, however we would have appreciated a response from Malcolm to any of our messages prior to arrival. 
When I went to pick up the keys the girl in the laundrette had no idea what I was talking about. We got the keys in the end, however it would be worth mentioning to the staff there so they are aware of such arrangements.
The washing machine wasnt working and there was no toilet roll when we arrived, we had to dash out and buy some. 
Also, only being provided one set of keys for a two roomed apartment for two couples was a little inconvenient and required us all to come and go en masse.
All that being said, we did overall enjoy our stay in Dublin."
7276073,461324120,5/31/2019,"We loved Dublin. The apartment  is in a great, central location and Malcolm was always available  to help us with all our queries."
7276073,463423673,6/3/2019,considering price for city centre this place was ok.
7276073,465243351,6/7/2019,"Great location.  Have to walk 500m to a laundry business to pick up keys.  There are some cleanliness issues in the apartment (mold in bathroom, and dusty vents) - everything else is clean. Some of the electrical outlets were not working / visibly broken, the coffee machine didn't work - no channels on TV. There is a ""utility closet"" that houses water heating and is particularly noisy whenever going to bathroom."
7276073,466437895,6/9/2019,Fantastic location in the Centre if Dublin with only a short walk to Temple Bar! We had a great weekend
7276073,467949642,6/11/2019,"Location of the apartment was fantastic and it was very easy to get in touch with Malcolm and check in.  
Unfortunately the lights in a couple of rooms didnt work, the apartment looked more tired than the pictures and the level of cleanliness was poor."
7276073,469739622,6/15/2019,Good location
7276073,476965669,6/27/2019,Superb location within walking distance of many attractions. Try checking in before or after rush hour as traffic can become heavily congested.  The best way to the location is definitely by bus or taxi. Overall a great experience!
7276073,478675609,6/30/2019,"Malcolm was easy to get in touch with over the phone but a little tougher on chat. 

The apartment was nice and well price however the bathroom could have done with more of a clean in our opinion. There was also a really really loud rave the first night which went onto till 3am, not sure if it was organised by the apartments but their windows were open so suggests it may happen a lot?

Easy to find and easy to gain access too as well. 

Overall it was a great place to stay and was very close to temple bar, thanks for letting us all stay!"
7276073,481150553,7/4/2019,Malcolm was always quick to respond to any questions we had. We arrived in Dublin before our check-in time and he was helpful in getting us checked in as soon as he could.
7276073,482326414,7/6/2019,Nice stay and a great location thanks again
7276073,484121643,7/8/2019,"Basic accommodation in a great location.
It was perfect for what we needed. A deep clean, clear out and changing a few light bulbs would go a long way to making this a great place."
7276073,488633895,7/15/2019,The location of the apartment was in a good area close to main attractions and bars and the only true highlight to the place. The cleanliness of the apartment was not to a suitable standard and no lights worked in the second bedroom. The beds were very uncomfortable and the apartment is located in a noisy area of the complex. The check in process was a bit inconvenient as we had to pick up the keys from a laundry place which wasnt communicated to us prior and the lady working there didnt know anything about the keys as this was not communicated to her. Overall it was an underwhelming experience. Best to spend minimal time in the apartment if choosing to stay here.  Great but expensive location to store your bags.
7276073,491521748,7/20/2019,"Exactly as expected!  Comfy sleep, close to all the fun. Clean."
7276073,496191059,7/27/2019,"Location is as advertised but the unit and building itself are showing some serious signs of wear & tear. If you have a car getting around is very difficult. The unit itself has no parking and the nearest lot is a 10 minute walk ( 15 minute drive due to 1 way streets ) and will set you back about $25 euros/ night. If you are there to party and simply looking for a crashpad it will be perfect, if you are looking for something a bit more comfortable you might want to consider other options."
7276073,500568710,8/2/2019,Very convenient but needs modernising to bring up to standard
7276073,502181232,8/4/2019,Great location and easy. Nice guy. Need to clean up the bathroom and theres a room without lights.
7276073,502967706,8/5/2019,"This apartment is extremely well located close to the entertainment district of Dublin and Trinity College.  You can easily walk to many of Dublins attractions from here. 

It is up two floors, but there is an elevator. The apartment is compact, but has all you need for 4 people."
7276073,508183663,8/12/2019,"Zeer moeizame communicatie met de verhuurder(s), lastig als je graag je reis een beetje op voorhand inplant. Het appartement is leuk gelegen en goed voor korte verblijven, maar verwacht geen buitensporige luxe."
7276073,509405985,8/14/2019,"Ottima posizione. 
Appartamento e servizi un po' trascurati, avrebbe bisogno di revisione"
7276073,514047582,8/20/2019,"Nice place, just what we were looking for. Great location in Dublin."
7276073,515123739,8/22/2019,"If youre looking for something in the right location then this is the place for you. Everything is in walking distance and we felt safe the whole time. The beds were comfortable and there is plenty of storage,

 But it does need a bit of tlc and a deep clean (especially the bathroom.)

Communication with us was poor. It couldve been bad timing on our part and we did have several questions but of all the texts, calls and messages we sent 1 call was answered, and only 1 question was answered via text.

 There was only one set of keys which was a little inconvenient as well.

 If this place is given a bit of a sort out and you find the tv remote it will be excellent!"
7276073,527128028,9/10/2019,"Malcolms apartment is in a great location for the citys places to see. Most places walkable. The space is comfortable. We were 3 older women and it was great. The building is old and fairly typical of an inner city space of that vintage. 
The key pick up was organised the day before and went very smoothly. We arrived in the evening and Malcolm made arrangements to suit that timing."
7276073,529947634,9/15/2019,"The appartment is perfectly situated in a quiet area although very close to the centre and the temple bar area. It wasnt the most charming appartment but it has all the basic needs that one requires.
Perfect for a family or a small party since it has two bedrooms.
Malcom was very quick answering our questions.
We picked up the keys in a nearby laundry, no problem
Thomas and Maria"
7276073,532296017,9/19/2019,Great location close to Temple Bar area
7276073,533851993,9/22/2019,Great location close to Temple Bar for a night out. Easy to walk to/ from but far enough away so no noise. Collect keys from the friend. Close enough to walk to Trinity College and Grafton Street.
7276073,536330213,9/26/2019,You will love the location.
7276073,556795016,10/30/2019,Our stay in Dublin was really great. The apartment er has a really good location and is perfect for 4 people to stay. We are defiantly booking this place for our next trip to Dublin.!
7282883,470663366,6/16/2019,"If you can afford it, youll be glad you treated yourself! Rachel and Alans refurbished historic home overlooking a tree filled park is so spacious and tastefully decorated! It was perfect for our adult family of four! It is located a comfortable walk from the EPIC museum and  a quick taxi to Dublins other main tourist attractions."
7282883,473898715,6/22/2019,"This is a beautiful home in a perfect location.  It's very quiet on the park and yet easy to walk to many interesting and historic areas.  We pretty much walked everywhere since it was so convenient.  And the home itself is just as nice as the pictures suggest--beautiful, clean and very stylish.  The perfect place!"
7282883,480264533,7/2/2019,"Great place located in a cute neighborhood.  Walk out to a really friendly park full of Dubliners and their dogs!  Just a block or two from the River Liffey, the Grand Canal and Trinity College.  Beautiful sunsets in the master bedroom.  Lots of easy food options when you tire of bars and Guinness.  And yes, they have cable TV!  Rachel was super gracious the whole way.  We loved the space."
7282883,481787418,7/5/2019,Amazing place and location!
7282883,483351158,7/7/2019,"A perfect home, host was outstanding with special touches to make us feel so welcome.  Very well positioned in Dublin for the tourist places as well as new, shiny harbour area."
7282883,489792333,7/17/2019,"Rachels home is a beautifully appointed, spacious and welcoming place to stay for a visit to Dublin.  It is located very close to  the new Docklands area, and overlooks a lovely little park.  Beautiful comfortable beds, and the extra treat of an Aga stove made it an ideal base for our visit to Dublin."
7282883,495701095,7/26/2019,"Rachel's townhouse was perfect for me and two of my coworkers for a work trip. There was enough space for us to have our own private areas, but the communal area was great for collaboration. The location was safe and quiet at night and close to our office on the Grand Canal Docks. Downtown was about a 20 min walk and easy taxi ride. Rachel was communicative leading up to our trip - and check in was easy. There is a cute park right out front that easily makes you forget you are in a city. Thanks for the stay Rachel!"
7282883,498693640,7/30/2019,Very nicely equipped and great location. Owners go out of their way to make your stay awesome!!.
7282883,502897609,8/5/2019,Beautiful home in a perfect location.
7282883,511264511,8/17/2019,Great location!
7282883,513397288,8/19/2019,"Rachel and her husband Alan are extremely friendly, accommodating, and hospitable. We enjoyed their large multi-level home that felt very warm and welcoming. Our group of 5 adults were very comfortable. The main bathroom and kitchen have been updated and the bedrooms and living area are well appointed in traditional style furniture. The home was everything we could have asked for for the Dublin leg of our Ireland trip. Keep in mind that the home has many stairs and none of the bedrooms are located on the ground level, therefore you will be carrying your luggage up or down multiple sets of stairs. A few people in our party left our luggage in the living room and carried up the items we needed. Overall, this was one of our favorite places we stayed. One of the people in our group even stated that they preferred this home over our stay on castle grounds later in the week. We would highly recommend this home for your Dublin stay!"
7282883,515013014,8/22/2019,Thank you so much - really grateful for everything.
7282883,518278615,8/26/2019,"Rachel and Alan were terrific hosts!! We could not have had a better time!! Their place is very well located with restaurants, convenience stores and hotels only a short walk away. Great place to stay in Dublin!!"
7282883,521858444,9/1/2019,A wonderful place to stay! Beautiful house on a really picturesque square. Would highly recommend!
7282883,525220989,9/7/2019,"Perfect location right next to Grand Canal. Was able to walk to office in less than 5 minutes! Good area for restaurants, grocery, and fitness. 

Pros: luxury space, great kitchen area. Owners were very friendly and communicative. 

Cons: To get to master bedroom, you have to climb about 4-flights of stairs. And bathrooms are not on the same floor as the bedrooms. Bottom bathroom also has low head clearance so if youre a tall person, may be hard to stand up. Dryer didnt dry clothes very well. Needed to do a couple of cycles so might be better to just air dry. 

Suggestions: ask owner how to lock the door if youre not familiar with that system. Took a while to figure out."
7282883,529783106,9/15/2019,"Incredible house, location and hosts! We could walk from the house to almost every place we visited! Its a super cute and charming house with a lovely outdoor area! We would absolutely come back and stay!"
7282883,534979634,9/23/2019,The hosts were very responsive and helpful!
7282883,538108527,9/29/2019,This is a wonderful and spacious house. Highly recommend it for large groups. Rachel and Alan were very accommodating and great hosts.
7290341,418529410,3/2/2019,Jerrys apartment is so perfectly located for gigs in The Grand Canal Theatre or the 3Arena. We had a super stay and everything we needed for a comfortable overnight was at our disposal. Great to have secure parking in Dublin included with the stay.  Thanks Jerry
7290341,419020207,3/3/2019,"Nice apartment, comfortable and clean with everything you need, bring tea/coffee/milk sugar though. Its a pretty perfect location for the 3arena, nice cafes close by, really quiet at night. Great Airbnb spot!"
7290341,421017293,3/8/2019,"Jerry's stay was a perfect location for anyone visiting Dublin, especially if you have a car.  The car park was super easy and helpful to have in the busy city and the location of the apartment makes it easy to walk everywhere in the city."
7290341,423833023,3/15/2019,Jerry's apartment was perfect for our trip to Dublin. It is easily walkable to the sites but in a quieter area. The apartment was larger than I expected for the city as well. We enjoyed our stay!
7290341,425424566,3/18/2019,Wonderful stay. We had everything we needed and the location was superb. Jerry was a great host.
7290341,426918285,3/22/2019,Jerrys apartment was a great place to stay in Dublin. It was a great location along the river and the apartment was very comfortable. I would recommend Jerrys place to anyone staying in Dublin!
7290341,428559804,3/25/2019,Was a below average stay compared to my other stays. Would be ok for a crash pad but not great for family. Smelled like chemicals in bathroom. Decent location but a bit of a walk to center.
7290341,428939299,3/26/2019,Great little flat in a great location.
7290341,429901926,3/29/2019,"Great location with plenty access mins away to fantastic Dublin city centre hotspots...
Private parking was fab and very safe area... would reserve this again anytime without hesitation."
7290341,430946755,3/31/2019,Location is good. Disappointed about a couple of bits like the dishwasher but really handy for a night in Dublin.
7290341,431934523,4/2/2019,We were disappointed by our stay at Jerrys place unfortunately. The apartment was conveniently located and check in was smooth enough. However we found the apartment was grubby and damp smelling and had no river view as suggested by the photos. The towels provided were damp. The beds were fairly comfortable. It was fine for a 1 night stay but I would not like to stay longer and would not stay again as I believe there are better options available.
7290341,432252722,4/3/2019,"Great location, convenient parking space, host very available and responsive by phone or text. Kitchen/dining/living space is suitable for heart of Dublin, where youll be out and about most of the time."
7290341,437868011,4/15/2019,"The condo is in a quiet location, right off the river.  We got in late on a Sunday night but were able to find good food in the Olys restaurant which is directly across the river in the Hilton Garden Inn.  Nice coffee shop right on the river, and just up the street."
7290341,439134619,4/18/2019,Jerry s place war in a great location and you can walk to many pubs and restaurants! Jerry was easy to communicate with! We enjoyed our stay at Jerseys place!
7290341,439514042,4/19/2019,"Great location, clean and comfortable place and Jerry was very responsive. Basic amenities, nothing flash but everything we needed for an overnight stay."
7290341,440199093,4/20/2019,Great location and loved that it had the gated parking for our rental car. Safe and clean. Very helpful and easy to communicate with. Thank you!
7290341,445979408,4/30/2019,"Small, 2 bed flat, great location to 3 arena and surrounding area, comfy beds
Disappointed that there was no tv. Parking included! Cheaper than a hotel at maximum capacity!"
7290341,446415208,5/1/2019,"A very nice place, perfectly located for 3 Arena and Dublin city center. Great value"
7290341,446761875,5/2/2019,"Great location, walking distance to most attractions along the waterfront"
7290341,447933341,5/4/2019,"Jerry was a perfect host and very prompt in replying to whatever query we had. This flat is perfectly located for getting round the city. 
Would definitely stay again. Great value too!"
7290341,450455826,5/9/2019,This was a terrific place to stay. Jerry was and an excellent host.
7290341,452962577,5/14/2019,"Lovely location within the city limits. Close to the beautiful Beckett Bridge. Great for 2 couples, but anymore that that may be too much for sleeping accommodations unless its with children. Enjoyed our stay very much!"
7290341,453927082,5/17/2019,"Jerrys place was in a great location! Tucked away on a peaceful street right next to the water with shops for everything nearby. The two bedrooms were super clean, beautiful and filled with sunlight.

Jerry was so kind and communicative helping us into our parking spot, carrying my mothers suitcase and checking us into the apartment. We so enjoyed our stay!!"
7290341,454445437,5/18/2019,Awesome place to stay!! Great location . Highly recommend!!
7290341,455784010,5/20/2019,"2 bedroom apartment, close proximity to river and sights."
7290341,457548421,5/24/2019,Great location within walking distance to anything you would want to see or do in Dublin!
7290341,457988623,5/25/2019,Great location for a concert but not luxury at the price !
7290341,459407868,5/27/2019,Great spot in town. Really only for 4 people. Confirm washer/dryer if youre planning on using.
7290341,461872106,6/1/2019,"Great location, near city centre and 3 arena. Plenty of room for four of us. Good communication and prompt responses from Jerry."
7290341,464685927,6/6/2019,"We are a family of four that recently rented Jerry's place.  Jerry's home is comfortable to come back to. It is a small space if you have little ones (we don't) that need a little extra space to spread out.  The home was clean and in a great location that felt safe and close to things to do, within walking distance.  Taxis are very easy to get in Dublin if you don't choose to walk, as it can be a 10-15 min walk along the river to get to the main areas.  This was enjoyable for us, so the initial distance was absolutely fine, but if you aren't wanting to walk, keep the taxis in mind.  As far as the space itself, it has all the basics you need in order to be comfortable during your stay.  Couple of things to keep in mind if you are choosing this location, a family of four can be comfortable, more than that may be challenging.  From a female perspective, it was a bit challenging to get ready in the morning, as there are limited to no outlets near the available mirrors.  This shouldn't deter you from renting this space at all, just come prepared with your make-up mirrors.  Also, the bathtub/shower is a pretty big step down, so if you have any motor challenges be prepared for that.  I was just imagining my older parents having a harder time with that feature if they had rented this space.  Jerry is quick to respond if you have any questions in order to make your stay enjoyable.  Thank you again Jerry for a great stay!"
7290341,465755556,6/8/2019,"Great location, spacious and we had a great time"
7290341,467513387,6/10/2019,"The apartment is in a side street not on the riverside as stated in the description. The bathroom was shabby, and there was mould on the bedroom wall in the bigger bedroom. The second bedroom had a double bed in it ,however it was meant for a single. As a result it had to be.
 Climbed across to get in and out. The living/kitchen are lacked any kind of comfort.
All in all disappointed and certainly not worth the. Cost of almost  ‚Ç¨200 for 1 night."
7290341,468855198,6/13/2019,"Jerry's place was really lovely for my recent stay. The location is a lot closer to things than I realised. Excellent location for the 3arena, would also be good for anyone visiting for the Aviva Stadium. Communicating with Jerry was a breeze, fast replies and excellent instructions for arrival (including which bus and stop to get off at). The apartment was well equipped, with washing machine, dishwasher and plenty of spare pillows and bedding. Would absolutely recommend staying here on your next visit. Thanks for having us!"
7290341,470676102,6/16/2019,"Central location for RDS, Aviva stadium,  shopping and site seeing . Private secured parking"
7290341,471878172,6/18/2019,This space was perfect for our family of four. Close enough to the important sites and we had no trouble with Amy of the amenities.
7290341,473177407,6/21/2019,Thanks!
7290341,474728942,6/23/2019,Alles so wie beschrieben
7290341,476541148,6/26/2019,"We enjoyed our visit to Dublin and stay in the apartment.  The apartment was perfectly located.  Although it was on the first floor, it felt very secure and safe."
7290341,478859589,6/30/2019,"This place is in an excellent location.  We stayed for 2 days; parked our vehicle and walked wherever we wanted to go.  There is a beautiful, private courtyard (part of the reason we stayed there).  However, there is no seating in it.  We took the kitchen chairs outside.  
We found that the place was not very clean.  There was insufficient comfortable seating for 4 people in the Living Room.  The addition of 2 armchairs is recommended. The kitchen is not well stocked in terms of dishes.  However, there were basics including laundry  and dishwasher soap.  There were plenty of towels.  The beds and the bed linens were reasonably comfortable. 
We would have benefited from more information for check in e.g. exact location of the unit and where we would meet the host/representative.  I didn't ask those questions assuming that it would be straightforward when we got there. (It wasn't.)
Overall, based on the pictures and the description, we were disappointed with the unit but not with the location."
7290341,480661158,7/3/2019,Very convenient location -- almost everything you want to see is within walking distance.
7290341,482404350,7/6/2019,"Jerrys house is brilliant, plenty of space, clean, tidy and the whole stay was very enjoyable and hassle free. Jerry is a great host!"
7290341,483345558,7/7/2019,Great central location. Perfect to 3 arena and city centre
7290341,484708009,7/9/2019,Great location for 3 arena and getting about Dublin.
7290341,485595235,7/11/2019,"This is just an OK place. I was hoping for a four-star apartment but landed a three-star based on overall condition of the place, amenities, and decor. You will get nothing but the very basics at this AirBnB. BUT...if you're looking for a place close to everything in central Dublin, look no further."
7290341,486291970,7/12/2019,Just as described and location is fantastic!
7290341,489289967,7/16/2019,"This is a nice, basic AirBnB. It is conveniently located and within walking distance to many of the tourist spots that we visited. We liked that there was a parking space for our rental car and a grocery store right down the street. Being so close to the river I was awakened by loud squawking birds early in the morning but the rest of my family was not bothered by them. Jerry's place worked well for our visit to Dublin."
7290341,489778773,7/17/2019,Jerrys place was a great location. Very near the Temple Bar District but far enough away to still be quiet at night. Jerry was friendly did everything in his power to make sure we had a good stay.
7290341,490767825,7/19/2019,Responsive host and great location.
7290341,493994344,7/23/2019,Great location right on the river.  Very comfortable apartment with a lovely outdoor garden area perfect for a lazy afternoon drink after a big day exploring. Wifi is fast and parking excellent. Perfect for 2 couples or a family of four.
7290341,495634665,7/26/2019,Great location and secure parking. Which was important for our motorbikes.
7290341,499429708,7/31/2019,"We used the Appartement mainly because of the central situation. We came back from our roundtrip in Ireland to go the day after to ferry to GB. For arrival in the late afternoon and a last visit in the Centre of Dublin the place was optimal. Thank you Jerry for the good hospitality. From first contact until the end the respondtime was everytime very good. It was easy to find the Appartement. Jerry has organized that someone was there when we arrived to let us in. We are a Family with 2 teenagers and it was enough space for all of us. The Appartement was clean, the kitchen is good equipped. Great stay, the Appartement will also be good for several days in Dublin. Thank you very much, Jerry."
7290341,500619499,8/2/2019,Jerrys place was very comfortable and in a great location. Great communication and he was very helpful!

7290341,519803794,8/29/2019,"Nice location in Dublin. Parking for car ok.
Bathroom should need to be refreshed, and windows in kitchen may need to be opened sometimes..."
7290341,523241577,9/3/2019,The apartment is very basic but functional.  Having a parking spot was a big plus.  All the rooms were smaller than we thought.  It was great to have a market so nearby.    There was a lot of street noise and very loud gatherings in the street right across from the apartment until 1:30 am.
7290341,525904642,9/8/2019,"Checkin was easy. Communication with Jerry was good. We were three persons. We needed to a second pair of keys. He gave us it one day later after we asked for. 
I stayed many houses with Airbnb. This apartment was not memorable one. Second bedroom was very tiny. Kitchen and bathroom were very old fashioned. We actually dont get somethings why he buy a coffee machine or a new shower curtain. 
Location of the apartment  was okay. It tis only fives minutes walk to get The Congress Center. It takes ten minutes walk to Temple Bar. 
Your expectations would not be too high for the apartment. Otherwise communication with Jerry and location are okay."
7290341,527273197,9/10/2019,"Great Location 
Easy access to Dublin highlights 
Most places walkable from Jerrys place 
A bit small for anymore than 4 people 
Underground parking included"
7290341,530078563,9/15/2019,"Lovely stay. Great location and lovely bedrooms. Only negative was lack of mirrors and ventilation, there were big windows in the living room but were locked shut so when cooking felt a bit steamy and non vented well. But apart from that it was a lovely stay and perfect for us . Jerry was very quick in his responses and very helpful."
7290341,533910173,9/22/2019,"A stylish apartment next to the river. Temple bar is a 10 minute walk away and you can jump into the hop on hop off bus right on the other side of the river.
Jerry was a good host and shared some useful insider knowledge."
7290341,534914625,9/23/2019,"Comfortable apartment in a central location, we were met on arrival and shown our secure car park in the attached parking building, and taken to our apartment. Plenty of street parking locally for after check out when we were there. Met all our requirements for a comfortable safe visit to Dublin."
7290341,535351670,9/24/2019,"Amazing location, especially if you're attending gigs in 3Arena"
7290341,536648311,9/27/2019,This was a great location and the host was very responsive.

7290341,552341583,10/21/2019,Jerry's place is clean and in a convenient area of Dublin. Jerry went above and beyond to accommodate us.
7290341,554384053,10/26/2019,Great location!
7290341,561900198,11/10/2019,"We stayed here as a family of four for a four day, three night stay.   The flat is in a great location;  easy walking distance to most things in the city and in a safe area.   Candidly, we didn't do much in the flat besides shower and sleep.  (That's probably a good thing, because there isn't a ton of room there for much else; 2 BR, a small bath, and a small kitchen/sitting room)  Jerry was very accommodating and quick on the communication.   Don't come here expecting four-star accommodations or amazing bed linens.  However, if you want an affordable stay that is close and in a safe neighborhood with a supermarket steps away, this is a good base for a Dublin vacation."
7323991,422022836,3/10/2019,Good place to stay for a weekend in Dublin. Tiziana is a great host and very hospitable.

7323991,459361761,5/27/2019,Tiziana was so welcoming and accommodating! She gave us lots of tips and information about Dublin and gave us recommendations for places to visit and transportation options. We had everything we needed and the space was very clean and comfortable. The location is on a street with a good amount of nightlife so I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're sensitive to noise.
7323991,462668761,6/2/2019,"Well located apartment. Clean room and bathroom. Tiziana is easy to get in touch with and very responsive. She is very sociable, energetic, organized, and keen to help the guests with anything."

But she helped us along with information, everything was ready and she explained to us where to got and how. Everything clean, good bed and clean bathroom. It is a bite noisy because the windows go out towards the street but still ok for one night (and I come from a quiet tiny village so maybe not so good to compare :) ). Very good to reach by bus!"

7326924,451243626,5/11/2019,"Ann's home is beautifully kept and Ann went out of her way to be friendly and offer lots of local insights. Although I was only paying for the bedroom Ann let me have the run of the house and I felt that i could come and go as I pleased.
I will recommend Ann's home to friends who want to stay in this area."

7326924,470499103,6/16/2019,Ann place is perfectly located if attending RDS as we did. Short 5 minute walk into Sandymount village and approx 15mins to RDS /Ballsbridge area. Ann communicated well before and throughout our stay. Room would be on smaller side but more than adequate. Would stay again if attending an event in area.
7326924,472306145,6/19/2019,A great place to stay if going to concert in RDS as its within walking distance. Ann is lovely and the room was so clean

Ann is a very hospitable host who provides breakfast. I am coeliac and Ann had gluten free cereal and gf bread. Would def recommend Ann s house to visitors to Dublin.
7326924,489264675,7/16/2019,This lovely home is a short walk to transportation and within walking distance of the sea and the village that has wonderful cafes with friendly people.

7326924,562777604,11/11/2019,Great quiet location and perfect for those attending events at the RDS or in the Ballsbridge area
7328652,420297792,3/6/2019,"We had a lovely stay - the cottage was very clean and the hospitality was amazing. Located right off the sea side and under a 30 minute drive to the city center, it was the perfect place to relax and take in the beauty of Ireland's east coast. Katy recommended many lovely restaurants nearby (that we took advantage of walking to) and also suggested a beautiful hike in Wicklow Mountains National Park (the hike, called Spink Loop, started at the Glendalough car park and took us on one of the most beautiful hikes we had ever been on - would HIGHLY recommend)."
7328652,422020767,3/10/2019,"We had a great stay at Katy's seaside cottage. It had everything you could need. Katy left lots of food for us to have as breakfast as well as tea and coffee. Extra blankets and towels, slippers and hot water bottles were all provided. The cottage is in an excellent location. It is across the road from a lovely beach and several other beaches are accessible by foot from the cottage. Rush is only a short walk to a number of pubs and restaurants. The cottage was very clean and comfortable. Its exactly as the pictures show. Katy is an amazing host who gave us a great welcome and introduction to rush and the surrounding area. I highly recommend Katy's cottage."
7328652,425480722,3/18/2019,"Katy's seahorse is a perfect getaway with many options to hike and to enjoy the sea only footsteps away. But also to do daytrips to Dublin - also on St. Patricks Day - bus and train connection worked well - about one hour to city centre.
Katy is a wonderful host and was very easy to communicate with.
Thank you very much for 4 wonderful days!"
7328652,426236433,3/20/2019,"A wonderful quiet, private little cabin just a few steps away from the beach. Made for a very relaxing little escape."
7328652,427925201,3/24/2019,Absolutely amazing location and great scenery. Katy is an excellent host and I will definitely be coming back.
7328652,433939750,4/7/2019,"Katy's place was very charming and we felt like home from the first moment we entered the cottage. When we arrived, we were nicely welcomed by Rosa. We just saw Katy one time during the week we were in Rush, but she was very kind and helpful - in every aspect: restaurants, shops, hotspots,... In the cottage you can find enough informations about places nearby and far-off that Katy had prepared. All in all, we had a lovable stay at Katy's place!"
7328652,436511162,4/13/2019,"Katy was a wonderful host and had everything ready for us when we arrived. The location is picturesque and the breakfast food is a wonderful touch, we used just about all of it during our three night stay. Katy was very friendly and provided us with some really helpful tips. Would definitely stay there again!"
7328652,443191243,4/25/2019,"If I could give this location and Katy more than 5 stars I would. The cottage is wonderful.....about 20 steps from the Irish Ocean, which was just beautiful.
The cottage is just as pictured..the bed so ""comfy"" after  a long day of talking a ""walk about"". Knowing that I would be tired and much need of coffee coming from the states...everything I needed for that hot cup of coffee...was just waiting for me. ""Thank You"" so much Katy.
Every question I asked were answered in a timely manner and with additional helpful information. In short Katy was just great and very helpful.
The town of Rush is great.....everyone very friendly and really everything you would need. A wonderful town butcher (was able to get fresh British breakfast sausage).
The sunsets and sun rises are breathtaking. Just what would be needed to get away and clear ones mind.
I am already planning my next trip to Rush and the wonderful beach cottage."
7328652,444009459,4/27/2019,"Katys cottage is a perfect place for a romantic getaway. It looked exactly like on the pictures, it was full of character, cozy and comfortable. The attention to detail was greatly appreciated."
7328652,445963205,4/30/2019,"The pictures show what the cottage looked like some time ago. We liked the cottage nevertheless, although the worktop in the kitchen doesnt look very nice anymore (mould?) and it needs some refurbishment as well as the bathroom facilities. The flush doesnt work properly and the sink is always under water. It is more like Camping and it was a little bit cold. Taking a shower was an adventure (no curtain) and quite freezing after turning of the water. But the bed was very comfortable. And the host offers free food like milk, eggs, water... thats great. The surrounding/premises look quite nice but need some maintenace/care. Everything is little bit old and messy. 
But I Recommend the Apartment. The host is very nice and helpful but you have to know that a stay there is more like camping (very rustic) than a hotel or b&b."
7328652,448405778,5/5/2019,Katys place was exactly as described! We loved the cosy place and warm welcome as much as the local area of Rush. Katy was very helpful and communication was perfect. I will defenitely recommend this place to my friends!
7328652,449701041,5/7/2019,"Katys place was the perfect space to land. Clean, cozy and warm and a 30 second walk to the beach across the road which was quite beautiful for a nice brisk walk on the shore. Katy was lovely and quick to respond to our needs. She had great suggestions of what to do around the area too! We got visits from her sweet elder dog, Rosa, which we loved!! but if youre not a dog person, dont worry.. shes very smart and would get the hint ;) and she wouldve never come into the cottage, even when we invited her. We enjoyed loving her up every day so she came back for more. 
All in all we loved our stay here and plan on returning in the future!"
7328652,451787262,5/12/2019,Enjoyed our stay a lot. We had a rental car which is needed i think. Otherwise great stay definitly recommended!
7328652,452959703,5/14/2019,"Highly recommended.. great communication, awesome location, cute cottage!"
7328652,453614343,5/16/2019,"This is our second time to visit this beautiful cottage just beside the beach.what can we say....a totally relaxing getaway for my best friend and I. The tranquility is pure heaven.Katy,the host ensures you are most welcome, with every attention to detail attended to. We never want to leave when we visit.we would not stay anywhere else. Denise and Suzanne."
7328652,455916940,5/20/2019,"This little gem is just wonderful! I would highly recommend it! The added touches of sausages, eggs, milk and bread was fab and we were pleasantly surprised to find toothpaste, Linx and hairspray in the bathroom as we had forgotten them! We had lovely walks along the beach sipping gin and came back to the candles lit outside! It was just truly magical ‚ù§Ô∏è"
7328652,457497230,5/24/2019,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Katys place for 4 nights. We loved staying here! The place was cozy, and the bed/down comforter was truly heavenly after a long day exploring Ireland. Katys place was stocked with the essentials and she generously provided food for breakfast which we took advantage of on a few occassions. There was an issue with the toilet needing fixing where we had to leave for the day for this to be done, but Katy communicated perfectly and compensated for the trouble. We loved the area of Skerries and Katy made a lot of great suggestions of the area! One small issue that we had was a lot of spiders, which for some would not be bothersome but we arent super naturey people, so it was slightly unsettling. Overall, we thought the place was lovely and the perfect little oasis for our time in Ireland."
7328652,458755691,5/26/2019,Beautiful guest house in a beautiful location!
7328652,460805171,5/30/2019,"Staying in Katys cottage was a wonderful experience. It was clean, within walking distance of restaurants, and Katy was super responsive to our questions. 

One note on the town- if youre not familiar with the area, restaurant kitchens tend to close at 9, which can make finding a late supper tough. Plan ahead and youll be fine!"
7328652,462636916,6/2/2019,Very nice house next to the beach. We would be glad to come again!
7328652,464244397,6/5/2019,"Katys place was the first place we stayed in Ireland- We were greeted warmly and with complete respect. The cabin was beautiful- so many unique touches. We had breakfast supplies, wine and cute doggy visits! The area was quiet and authentic- so glad we had this cabin to come back to after a day in Dublin. I highly recommend this cabin to singles, and couples especially. The bed was super comfortable and we had everything we needed. We wish we could have stayed longer! What a great start to our trip!"
7328652,467238373,6/10/2019,"Katy's place was very clean, great location, peaceful."
7328652,468351144,6/12/2019,"This home is perfect if you are looking for a getaway and she provides you with some foods to male a good breakfast (eggs sausage, bread, butter, a ton of tea, and coffee)... As soon as you leave the property you are looking at a beautiful beach which is great to take a stroll on. We we're greeted by Rosa her dog who was the sweetest thing she just walked up and stood next to me wanting some attention but wasn't jumping or barking or anything. There is the main road walking distance away where there are pubs and restaurants. And if you go right when you get to the beach and up the stairs next to a play ground there is a restaurant with great seafood chowder."
7328652,469355679,6/14/2019,"Katy's place was really comfy and cute.
We were there 2 nights, and it was really good. The place is really cozy and the location is brilliant.
Katy was a really good host, easy to communicate with, and really kind."
7328652,471880297,6/18/2019,"Katys little Seahorse Cottage is the absolute perfect escape into the amazing coastline of Ireland. The cottage is a decorated blend of vintage meets seaside meets Anthropologie, down to every last detail including the gorgeous flowers throughout. It was a very quiet and very safe area. Note that some cab drivers will find it tricky to find so in addition to the aercode use Killbush Ln to get you in the general direction just in case. Public transport was fabulous and got me everywhere I needed to go. Highly recommend a trip to Howth, Skerries and Malahide, though Rush is a beautiful village all on its own. Would highly recommend this spot."
7328652,472768608,6/20/2019,"The pictures are true to the beautifully styled romantic cabin by the sea. Katy was a superb hostess, everything was perfect. Will definitely come back next time we visit Ireland"

7328652,481142025,7/4/2019,"We had an amazing time at Katy's beautiful beach cabin. It was a cosy room with nice touches, breakfast food was left for us which was lovely. The property is right on the beach, which meant lovely morning walks in the sun. Rosa the dog met us on arrival and came to visit us a few times a day for some attention - she even showed us to the beach! This was just the break we needed and more. We will treasure it forever. xxx"
7328652,483290614,7/7/2019,"Lovely cottage. Katys place is a few steps from the beach, comfort walks, and good commuting distance from Dublin without the nighttime madness. We had everything we needed and more.  Will definitely recommend her place."
7328652,485229697,7/10/2019,A very charming and attractive place to stay with lots of thoughtful touches.  Possible to see the sea when showering and a few paces and you can walk on the beach.  Near to local amenities and yet very peaceful and private.  A great base to explore north Co. Dublin.  Would love to go back.
7328652,486133937,7/12/2019,We loved Katys place! She was very quick to respond and offered lots of tips for local restaurants. Her place is cute and comfy and we loved her dog Rosa! Katy also had a friend check on us as she was out of the country during our stay. We highly recommend her place for a relaxing stay!
7328652,488706101,7/15/2019,"This place is amazing. It is the cutest cottage. Very private, cute, and quiet. It provides an oasis to get away from everything. The beach is right there for your use. There is a great deck to relax on. The host is perfect."
7328652,490950348,7/19/2019,Everything ok
7328652,495061338,7/25/2019,"Beautiful beach cabin. Lovely for a romantic getaway. We had amazing weather so enjoyed spending time on the beach, costal walks and a visit to the Skerries. The cabin is exactly as in the photos - quirky."
7328652,497093427,7/28/2019,"Katys place is an amazing spot. She left in the fridge all the ingredients we needed for an amazing and complete breakfast and thats something my bf and myself highly appreciate. The cottage is beautifully decorated, is so cozy and has everything you need. The beach is 3 minutes walk and there are restaurants and shops very close. We went and came back to Dublin by bus and the 33 is just perfect. We definitely will come back."
7328652,500550508,8/2/2019,"One of the best experiences Ive ever had! Katys place is filled with comfort, coziness, beach vibes, relaxation, and a sense of home away from home. The level you can relax at with the sound of the seagulls and beach in the background are beyond amazing. The interior decoration directly reflects Katys generosity and hospitality. She is a super host and more! I will be booking this again!"
7328652,505479568,8/9/2019,Katy is a great host and the Seahorse is a wonderful place.
7328652,511430404,8/17/2019,"Just beautiful! You are at the beachs front door with an amazing coast line to walk along.  The little town is just charming, and the locals were as sweet as they come! Rosa was an added bonus too‚ò∫Ô∏è"

7328652,517104444,8/25/2019,A fabulous seaside beach house. Katy is a wonderful host and there are lots of thoughtful touches.
7328652,522630183,9/2/2019,It is off the beaten path in the taxi service does not work on the weekends so you need to have pre-arranged transportation if you want to leave the city town of Rush is a good 10 minute walk Katie provides you with breakfast for you to make for yourself which is outstanding the beach is directly across the street from you so you can literally wake up make your coffee or tea and go say good morning to the Sea the shower is excellent the space is calm inviting and beautiful miss Katy and her children are wonderful and so accommodating and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable I would stay here again
7328652,523753553,9/4/2019,"This is a place you want to stay if you want a rustic getaway, being left completely alone and in peace in a backyard cottage just across the street overlooking the beach. However, realize that this isn't a sparkling hotel room, its garden location means that some bugs and spiders will inevitably creep in. Being slight arachnophobes, Katy provided us with a vacuum to rectify the issue gladly. Otherwise, the inside is lovely, cozy, romantic and with pleasant artistic touches everywhere.. Which can't be said for the outside, the photos don't reflect the now derelict patio furniture, used just as rustic decoration pieces, and unappealing, tarp covered dirty plastic hot tub to match. In all honesty, you'll be fine with a little adventuring spirit, just don't expect luxury, it's a trade-off for a unique peace&quiet experience."
7328652,528012047,9/12/2019,Awesome
7328652,534893765,9/23/2019,"It felt like the Seahorse was created just for me.  I loved my stay there. It has everything you need and more.  Everything was amazing, what a healing place!"

7328652,542290601,10/6/2019,"What an absolute Gem! My girlfriend and I had a great weekend getaway and are so glad we found Katy's place. Right on the ocean and a beautiful little town, we would highly recommend staying here. The cottage itself was picturesque, quaint, and very clean with its own little private deck and area.  We even enjoyed walks on the beach with Rosa the family dog which was a pleasant surprise. Katy was a great host, always available for any questions that we had and very responsive. We can not wait to come back for another stay in the spring!"

7344109,547874316,10/16/2019,Deirdre was a fabulous host. Her house is in Sandymount which is 3 stops outside of Dublin proper on the Dart (takes about 10 minutes). The town is very cute with good restaurants and pubs nearby. The house is beautiful and she provided us with breakfast every morning.

He went out of his way to make check in as smooth as possible, provided drinking water in the room and extra towels, and allowed us to use dishes from the kitchen. We didnt meet him at all, but he was very responsive and helpful via messages. Declans place is very close to bus and tram routes, as well as the train station. Would recommend!"
7346103,455886522,5/20/2019,Very well located and in a cute condo.
7346103,460038665,5/28/2019,Declan was an excellent host! He made himself available and was easy to reach should we need anything. He provided many local tips and suggestions on what to do. At one point he even called a brewery to check if there was space at a tour for us! The room was stylish and had thoughtful touches such as bottles and glasses for water. The bed is firm but comfortable and he has black out curtains which are very nice. We slept at least 14 hours straight on it the first night! His house is very close to the Luas train which was very easy to use.
7346103,467345724,6/10/2019,"A new, beautiful appartment with a comfy bed for 2! Our host Declan was great! He was there at the check in to meet us. The house is around 15 minutes by bus to city center - we had no problems getting around. We recommend this place. Thanks!"

Not a huge amount of room for a large suitcase but he didnt mind us using the space outside the bedroom to store it. Bus stop is very close and takes you right into the city! Great option for your Dublin stay :)"

7346103,535434216,9/24/2019,The place was nice and clean. If there was a little extra space in the room it'd be perfect. Declan's information on how to get to the place was really accurate and helpful.
7346103,538024320,9/29/2019,A stylish room with super easy transport links into the centre of Dublin by bus or LUAS. This place was perfect for a weekend in Dublin. Thank you Declan!

7395563,461366502,5/31/2019,"The place is more like a hostel with just having your private room. Absolutly not worth it's money. Everything worn out and unclear description that the whole flat is shared with a lot of people.

Although we only stayed for one night, he was very accommodating and even offered to shop for food we might like for breakfast among other thoughtful details. He was also very friendly and gave us helpful advice about good places to visit and restaurants to eat in. His place was also conveniently located within walking distance to most places we needed to get to.

Because of our short visit we didn't need to use a lot of the amenities but one thing that would have been useful for a longer stay is the fact that he had a washing machine in the apartment so this is great to keep in mind if you're planning a longer stay :)

Thanks again for everything Marius!"

7395563,529207331,9/14/2019,This appartment was worn out (although nothing was broken).  Our room was clean but very basic. Bathroom was shabby. Marius was very friendly and helpful.
7395563,534069813,9/22/2019,Marius is very responsive person. A check-in time was after 18:00 but we asked him if its possible to put our stuff in the apartment in the afternoon because we came from another country and didnt want to walk with our luggage. And he told us that there is no problem to make like this. So we came in the afternoon and he quickly cleaned everything and let us to check-in. It was very nice. But the only one thing we didnt like is that in bathroom is not very comfortable. It is not sparkling clean in there and there is no bathroom shelf to put our stuff. Also we had to wait when hot water is coming. But it was good place for stay in the apartment in the center of Dublin.
7395563,534979039,9/23/2019,Very basic. Room is in a shared flat so there is a shared bathroom too. Host didnt seem to be interested in contact. Not worth the money I'd say. Room was clean though.

At the same time it was quite cold (end of May - beginning of June) in the flat even with the heater on. The water pressure in the shower was weak, and it had two separate cranes for cold and hot water (in my country we have one). Sometimes we saw a spider in the kitchen and bathroom. The WiFi connection was a bit low, not strong enough for YouTube. TV had a distorted picture."
7413610,467967278,6/11/2019,"Francesca met us with the keys and was very responsive by phone and text throughout our stay when we had questions.   There were maps and guidebooks in the apartment for our use.    There were plenty of towels and linens.   Large modern wardrobe as well as a dresser and bookshelf unit in bedroom provided plenty of convenient storage.   The kitchen was well equipped with everything you would need for a comfortable stay.    Access was easy - no steps.   The neighborhood had convenient shopping for groceries and essentials.   Also some nice local cafes and pubs.    Easy walk down Thomas Street to Dublin center and close to the Liffey, Temple Bar, Guinness factory, etc.    Busses right around the corner.    My sister and I, two women in our mid seventies, had a wonderful week in Dublin.    Would recommend highly!"
7413610,469355891,6/14/2019,"Great location with a lot of landmarks to help you find your way, convenient to the Brazen Head with some great shops and diners in the area.

The place is spotless, has great light and has a well equipped kitchen. Francesca provided coffee, tea, sugar, milk and cookies. I appreciated that welcoming touch. 
The apartment seems secure as well as the neighborhood. 
There is a small grocery store (Spar) a block away that closes by 8:30 and a Tesco Express a block an one half from the building, as well as a couple of small cafes, restaurants and a pub (kitchen closes at 9) within one block radius. 
My daughter and I enjoyed a lot our stay in Dublin in Francescas place."

Location was good for walking to most tourist locations. We were asked to use the low water pressure setting in the shower which made for a light shower but coming from California we are pretty used to water conservation. Thank you for everything!"

I would definitely recommend and should I ever go back to Dublin, I would check out Francescas place first!"
7414933,421020699,3/8/2019,Brians place is truly in walking distance to everything Dublin has to offer. Cute cozy space & super clean! Also getting in contact with him was super easy & always responded fast. Would most definitely stay here again.

The check-in and check-out were very easy and Brian responds very quickly to enquiries & always tries to help. The apartment itself could use some paint updates here & there but it is spacious enough, it is very clean and has everything you will need. The bed is not too big but is very comfortable! The bedroom is situated on the street side so if you're a light sleeper like me be sure to bring earplugs. There is information on what to do in Dublin (even an old Lonely planet) and all the major sites are in walking distance. Good value for money, would stay here again! Some tips; go to EPIC museum (on emigration), Guinness Storehouse, day trip to Belfast & Giant's causeway (Wild Rover) also highly recommended. Food; many restaurants have early bird dinners before 19:00, good value for money (our favorite was Millstone restaurant)"

In fact, we had gotten ourselves lost trying to find it, and he called in a very calm voice and was willing to come find us. 

Turns out we were 50 feet from where we were to be

Great place to stay"

Perfect location for every tourist destination we wanted to reach by foot (only needed a cab to get there from the airport). Definitely check out the cafe across the street for breakfast to-go before heading out to the sites."

7414933,474607008,6/23/2019,"This apartment is in a very good location as across the road from St Patricks cathedral green and a quick 5 minute walk from Christchurch cathedral (and Leo Burdocks  the best chipper in Dublin!)
It was difficult to access the gated door (my husbands arm would not fit through to push and release the door) but Brian assures us this is to be repaired ASAP.
It is on a busy road so windows need to be closed at times but is right near everything with a Spar grocery store a few metres down the road and the bus stop very close also. Bed is very comfortable and the apartment is quite spacious with the bedroom separate from the living area kitchen.
Brian was unavailable when we arrived but we had a quick response from his friend Fabi and even though we couldnt check in until the normal time of 1pm she looked after our suitcases and dropped them into the apartment for us which is up a couple of flights of stairs - so much appreciated"

7414933,483239743,7/7/2019,"Brains place was perfect! Such an amazing location to everything . The Bite of Life cafe right across the street is a great place to grab breakfast. We were backpacking Europe and of course needed to do laundry . There is a place two doors down that will wash, dry and food for $10. Also, a nice little store with essentials, beer and liquor is a few doors down. Youre in walking distance of everything, although a few nights we did take a taxi because we were a bit tipsy. The apartment was nice, we enjoyed the separate living room space and TV. The kitchen was great so we could heat up leftovers and the frig was nice and cold. Bed was comfy and fits 2 perfectly. We stayed in the beginning of July and even though there was a fan, it did get a little warmer than us Americans are use to. But other than that this place was such a delight. Great way to end our vacation. I would stay here again my next trip to Ireland for sure"

Such a treat to be able to wash our stinky clothes before repacking them for the rest of our journey. Brian was extremely quick to respond to our questions. The apartment was sparkling clean. Thanks to Brian for sharing his place with us."

The bed was a bit small, but we managed :) 
Brian had given us a great welcome and made sure we know how to enter the apartment and helped us with the suitcases up the stairs.
The location of the apartment is great! Close to everything you need, tourist sites, department stores, bus station, and also great coffee!"
7414933,515725633,8/23/2019,This is the perfect location! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to visit and felt safe! We left some items at Brians once we checked out and he was very responsive and helpful and managed to get our items back to us. We would definitely stay again!

We had a great stay in Dublin and Brian and was very easy and quick to communicate with. His friends checked us in and were very helpful with that process. It was a quick visit for us on the end of our Ireland trip, but I would definitely come back and stay here. The only minor thing I might point out was that I am only 5ft tall and if I was not traveling with my taller friend I might have had some difficulting opening the downstairs gate to get into the flat. It was somewhat comical, but just something I should point out if you are a more petite solo traveler. :) Oh and definitely stop by to grab coffee and breakfast from Two Pups which was only a few blocks away."
7414933,540371925,10/3/2019,"Brian's place was adequate.  We especially appreciated the washing machine and the kitchen. There was a cafe across the street, but no places for dinner in easy walking distance."

7414933,557567300,11/1/2019,Great location! Very quiet and nice area but also close walk to major places. Clean apartment with good space. The only thing would be we could not get the heater in the room to work but the one in the living room was good to make the whole apartment warm enough.
7414933,559561787,11/4/2019,"Superb location, within walking distance of city centre but also with excellent local bars, cafes and shops.

7418150,425894670,3/19/2019,"Freddys place was great! Its in a fantastic location, we walked everywhere in the city! There are a bunch of great places nearby to eat as well. He had a ton of great recommendations as well for us for sights to see and places to eat. 

Please be mindful that this location is great but it is also located on the street. If you are a very light sleeper, I would recommend bringing some earplugs or something of that nature. We didnt have any issues with the noise but I would see anyone who is a light sleeper having an issue. 

Overall, I would recommend staying at their place. Freddy was very nice and accommodating and we loved the location!"
7418150,431643346,4/1/2019,We just needed a place to sleep and for this purpose it was good - very central with a direct view in the Liffey and cheap. The mattress was a little saggy though.

Great location near the main points of interest!"
7418150,479673406,7/1/2019,Very simple clean room on the outskirts of the busy touristy part of Dublin. I wish it had had a side lamp next to the bed though! Very comfortable and cozy bed with nice big window. The shower is a bit confusing and the bathroom light switch is OUTSIDE the bathroom and the switch for the shower is INSIDE the bathroom. Confusing for a second but then youll never forget it! Very clean and nice place.
7418150,488529599,7/15/2019,Freddy was very helpful in providing me very accurate directions upon arrival. The space was clean and he had a lot of really helpful tips and recommendations organized in a binder waiting for me. I enjoyed my stay in Dublin and would stay here again.

7450614,424284946,3/16/2019,"Adrienne was an amazing host. My flight was delayed by two hours, meaning I had to check in after midnight.

7450614,461380522,5/31/2019,"We found the close proximity to the Dublin airport was great for our needs, the room and bathroom were very clean, our host was easy to communicate with. The room was quite small, especially for two people, but was okay for one night, which is all we needed, as we had an early flight. A nice addition would be access to tea/coffee, as we found the lack of this to be unusual in an Air B and B.  Parking was on the street and was fine for us. The location is quiet and easy to find."
7450614,463902549,6/4/2019,"I stayed at Adrienne's with a friend for one night. We arrived at about half 11 at night and left the following morning at 6 for an early flight. Its a great location for anyone traveling to the airport and looking for somewhere to stay.  Adrienne was nice, although we didn't get talking to her much considering the times we were checking in and leaving her house at. She wasn't there when we arrived but gave us info on how to get into the house and where our room was. She usually responds to messages within 12 hours and there is ample parking available along her street where your car would be safe."
7450614,466583922,6/9/2019,"This is a beautiful home with a very friendly hostess who gave us a fabulous welcome.  Our room was bright with loads of storage and a comfy bed; the bathroom immaculate, white marble tiled, right outside our bedroom door was perfect. The home is a short walk to Swords, a very interesting town with a huge shopping mall, loads of places to eat and a fabulous castle to roam around.  Unfortunately, we were there for only one night so cant comment on access to kitchen, laundry, etc."
7450614,469824331,6/15/2019,Adrienne is a great host and her home is lovely. The room was just perfect and she was a great help in getting us to Malahide Castle for a concert. Would def recommend.

I only spent one night, but Adrienne's place was cozy and comfortable, and very clean. My sister and I were offered tea or coffee as soon as we arrived. She even provided power adapters in the rooms for her guests. We really appreciated that Adrienne phoned a cab for us so we could get to the airport the next day."
7450614,482415053,7/6/2019,"This was a great find on AirBnB.  Very close to the airport, but also just a short walk away from the cute downtown of Swords.  The place was immaculately clean.

It's within a short walk (10 minutes) of Swords town centre and Adrienne offered many suggestions of places to go for food. I chose her favourite (the Old School House) and I was not disappointed, it was excellent. 
The bed was really comfortable and the house was spotlessly clean. I'll definitely be looking to book the room again the next time I have an early flight."

I highly recommend Carolines Apartment and will definitely book again when in Dublin. Thanks Caroline! Dirk
7459001,437014555,4/14/2019,"This is a lovely apartment in a quiet residential area, set in a relatively new block, plenty of space for the 4 of us that were staying. The location is great with a bus stop literally just outside that gets you to the centre in about 17 mins or a 5 min walk to the tram which is a little more frequent and a little quicker. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean, there is a relatively busy road in front but you barely hear it and also a small river between, look out for the swans and the heron. All in all it was as described and perfect for our trip, everyone was happy, highly recommended."
7459001,444612900,4/28/2019,"Caroline was easy to reach prior to check in.  She provided detailed instructions regarding check in , directions, parking, and more.  The apartment was super clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen was better stocked than the one at home!"

Thank you Caroline x"

7459001,513415566,8/19/2019,"Caroline's place was amazing! Her instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The bus line was right in front of her apartment. Grocery store was in walking distance. It is not walking distance from O'Connell street, but that was not a problem. It was still easy to get to on the bus. Her apartment was clean, modern and very safe. She was very gracious on letting us use anything in the apartment. I wish I could have stayed there longer! Well done Caroline! Thank you for having us as guests!"
7459001,521908675,9/1/2019,Caroline is an excellent host and her special touches of hospitality went above and beyond. Her place is clean and in a great location. You won't regret staying there.
7459001,537183064,9/28/2019,"So many thoughtful touches! Location either walkable to heart of Dublin, or rail is a few blocks away - we never used our car once parked in secure garage (we ranged ages from 33-66). Great for two couples, restful overlooking little canal, everything you need is in condo, would stay there again in a heartbeat if visited again. Stayed two days at beginning of trip and two days at the end - comparing to other AirBnB stays - this is one of best!!!"
7459001,542341679,10/6/2019,"Caroline has a beautiful home, that is only about 15 mins on the local buses into the centre.

The apartment isn't far from central Dublin (we got a leap card on Caroline's advice and used the tram all weekend), and is close to some of the main attractions. Caroline provided plenty of tips and advice to help us navigate the city, which we really appreciated.

Thank you! We would highly recommend this as a base to explore Dublin."

Everything is within walking distance (Guinness Factory, Temple Bar area, shopping district), it was very easy for me to get around and should you want to take the bus to get outside of the city your really close to the station. I would highly recommend it! My flight landed at 8:30 am in the morning, so I got the flat by 11:00 am, and his flat mate Hafida was kind enough to let me in earlier than the ""expected time."" Very much appreciated the accommodation and he was very responsive!"

7527861,508027208,8/12/2019,Alojamiento recomendable para visitar el centro de Dublin. Situado entre las dos catedrales de la ciudad. El anfitrion es una gran persona con la que se puede conversar y aprender mucho de la ciudad. Pasamos enfamilia unos dias muy agradables alojandonos en casa de Javi

7527861,555211144,10/27/2019,The location is great. It was quit noisy and a little bit cold in the room. Communication was great. The shower gives a little bit of water.
7527861,559576113,11/4/2019,"Great location, walking distance from many activities.
Although we did not meet Javier in person, he took great care of us through his excellent and fast communication, and he put us into contact with Hafida who took care of the (flexible) check-in and check-out. We also had these small attentions towards my gluten free diet as soon as he got to know it. That was really appreciative.
The ""negative"" part of this location was the noise (low isolation of the window-frames) - very busy street, and as far as I'm concerned the bed's mattress was too hard.
But overall, a nice stay! Thanks a lot."
7528046,421320084,3/9/2019,"Great place to stay. Close to Dublin Center and the beautiful Howth, wich is realy recommended. Brian and Sheila are really nice and a great host. They really let me feel at home. Even made me a good breakfast at a early tme of the day.
I would stay again if I would visit Dublin again."

7528046,447912065,5/4/2019,The reality more than matched the description on the site. Brian is a great host. The cooked breakfast set me up for the day. A clean room in a house near the seafront and close to a Dart metro station to get into Dublin city centre. Great value.
7528046,455028400,5/19/2019,"I've been feeling very lucky to be a host in Brian's house where the true Irish hospitality shines.
Brian was so kind to pick me up from the train station and was extremely helpful and kind.  Sheila let me borrow her bike and thanks to her creativity being in the house is like being  to an art exhibition!  The location is amazing, what else to say.. An experience I will cherish forever.

The place is a 20 minute walk to everything in Dublin and 2 blocks away from public transit. We took advantage of lots of adventures during the day î-especially exciting was St Patricks Day parade in Dublin!  Loved, loved having her place as our quieter haven at night. The windows in living room overlook a lovely canal. We also enjoyed snuggling by her cozy fire. Apartment well stockedîeven fresh flowers, fruit and scones upon check in
Hated to leave!
Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!!!"
7541239,426828359,3/22/2019,Wendy's place is wonderful as her attention to the details and our comfort. I would love to visit her again in the future.

Wendy was a fantastic host - even driving my mother to the airport in the morning when she couldn't get a taxi. Cannot thank Wendy enough."

The best part was Wendy greeted us on arrival (with scones no less) and gave fantastic recommendations, directions and help. Really set us up for amazing food during our stay."
7541239,450421524,5/9/2019,This place was perfect for our small family. Wendy and Malachy were wonderful hosts. The extra touches and their quick responses made an already welcoming apartment that much more special. We would definitely visit again!
7541239,451277512,5/11/2019,"Wendys place was perfect and it had everything that we needed. She is such a gracious host and made us feel very comfortable and provided us with everything we needed. If we ever make it back to this area of Ireland we will definitely look her up and see if her place is available. One block from city transportation and a short 15 minute walk to downtown area.  The only improvement that I could suggest is trying to put in a larger shower, but even that was adequate enough for us.  Thank you so much for everything, you made everything work for us. 
Calvin and Margaret"
7541239,453638731,5/16/2019,"We enjoyed our stay here, very much. And not just for practical reasons of cleanliness and function (which you hope for in any case). No, there was way more. Things that were anticipated for weary travelers were placed for us. Some milk. Tea to brew and enjoy with the hot scones we discovered. Whoa! LEAP cards to use with local transit (look that one up on Wiki), all the cooking things you might need if that's your mode as it is ours. Plan on an interesting walk to St Stephen's Green or Christchurch cathedral or one of several fascinating museums along the way. And yes, that's an actual factual canal across the  street. Narrowboats weren't out during our stay, but I understand they do ply those calm waters. Company for resident swans."
7541239,456663458,5/22/2019,"Wendys place was nothing short of amazing!! She had organized everything from welcome scones, early check in, maps, etc. Super organized, gorgeous, clean place with an amazing host!! Flurry was one of the highlights, he is a sweetheart!!  Wendys place was great! Very classy, well kept and maintained and spotlessly clean! Wendy was an absolute pleasure to deal with! Certainly coming back here when I come back to Dublin!!"
7541239,458040590,5/25/2019,"We stayed for one night with Wendy and Malachy while attending a concert at Croke Park nearby and really enjoyed our stay. Communication from the hosts was excellent. Malachy was very accommodating with our arrival time and welcomed us to the flat. We really appreciated all the small touches that the hosts provided, and found everything to be very comfortable and clean."
7541239,461798379,6/1/2019,"Wendy and Malachy were both amazing and little Flurry was a wonderful welcome back after a long day of sight-seeing. The space was perfect for my mother and I and the amenities were great. The shower is small by American standards but that is to be expected in Europe. 

The only thing I would mention is that we were warned by two separate Uber drivers that we were in one of the roughest areas of Dublin. By no means did we feel unsafe at any times while walking from the flat into the city and this could be due to the fact that we were two women traveling alone but should still be noted. Other than that our stay and the hosts were fantastic!"
7541239,467901191,6/11/2019,"Wendys place was just lovely. The city center was just a few bus stops away and we appreciated being in such a tasteful place with every comfort we could expect. The fireplace is a particular highlight. Wendy keeps a ton of tips and folders on what to do when in town, which was very helpful to avoid the most blatant tourist traps. We highly recommend having a conversation about what you like... she certainly can guide you to the best places - as evidenced by our fabulous pub crawl. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
7541239,473783752,6/22/2019,"Wendy was an amazing host! She greeted us with scones, maps to the city, and leap cards. The location was an easy walk from commuting options and the apartment above her home was more than enough to be our home-away-from-home for the week. Plus, Flurry the pup was an added bonus! Highly recommend for travels."
7541239,475558166,6/24/2019,A real hidden gem right in the centre of Dublin with one of the bests hosts weve ever had!

7541239,494405826,7/24/2019,Everything was clean and as shown in pictures. Wendy was a very friendly host and gave us some great recommendations for places to go.
7541239,499907657,8/1/2019,"Wendy's place is a beautiful apartment, the entire upper floor of a lovely terrace house, and is one of the nicest rentals I have stayed at. The location was perfect for our stay - we were attending a conference and it was a relatively short walk to the conference centre. It was also quiet and not in the thick of the sometimes overwhelming tourist crowds of Dublin, a big bonus! Wendy herself is an excellent host, she was very kind, responsive, and provided us with great tips. We would definitely stay here again."
7541239,507210069,8/11/2019,"Wendy was a great host. The apartment is stylish, and very comfortable. The location is ideally situated for Croke Park, and the city centre is just a short walk away."

It felt really good that she let us sign in earlier, as we arrived with an early flight. Everything was perfect and we felt so relaxed at Wendys. Thank you so much Wendy!"
7541239,519307602,8/28/2019,Amazing! The warm scones were amazing.  We were at the beginning of our honeymoon and Malachy picked us up at the airport which was so welcomed.   Close to everything and both Wendy and Malachy were lovely and made great conversation :-)
7541239,521892746,9/1/2019,"We recently spent 4 nights at Wendys and were made most welcomed into her lovely home. The apartment was quiet and only a brisk 15/20 mins walk into the centre of the city- we loved the views from the high windows and it was great to leave them open and have fresh air . Wendys recommendations of where to shop for basics ,restaurants ,her favourite coffee shop etc made us feel right at home."
7541239,524696499,9/6/2019,"Wendys place was perfect for two.  Very clean with all one could ask for.  She supplied coffer, French Press, milk, even two Guinnesses.  Location was perfect, easy walk to all attractions, yet, far enough away that it was very quiet. Highly recommend."
7541239,530710656,9/16/2019,Wendy is an exceptional host and is available for questions any time.   She is also very willing to assist you in whatever she can.  The apartment is located very close to bus stops and train stations making it excellent to get around the whole of Dublin.  Even though it is so close to town the apartment was very quiet.  The apartment was very clean and has all the comforts of home.  Highly recommend anyone wanting to stay in Dublin to book this apartment.
7541239,532248420,9/19/2019,Beautiful apartment within an easy walk to the city centre.
7541239,533913233,9/22/2019,"Our stay at Wendy's place was excellent. The space was as advertised and there were no surprises. Wendy was there to greet us and show us around the rental when we arrived. She was also always very responsive in her communications leading up to our stay as well as while we were in Dublin. She had put scones in the oven to bake so they would be hot and fresh for our arrival. In the fridge were butter and milk for the morning as well as cooking oil, sugar, and spices. 

Wendy took the time to discuss our plans while in Dublin and offered several very useful suggestions. The apartment itself was on the 2nd floor of the building and looked out onto the Royal canal across the street. It was very clean and well equipped for our stay. The bedroom was large with high ceilings and a nice comfy queen bed. The bathroom was small but adequate for our needs. She is located a half a block off of a major road that has buses going into the town centre every few minutes. It is a short, 10-15 min walk to the centre of Dublin from her place. All in all I would not hesitate to rebook Wendy's place if I was to return to Dublin again.

Brendan and Bronwyn, Canada"
7541239,535896044,9/25/2019,Wendy was extremely helpful and informative. She allowed me to check in early based on my flights arrival time. She made several recommendations regarding what to see and do - and they were all great. We felt very at home here.
7541239,536814451,9/27/2019,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it will be a hard act to follow! The apartment is charming, artistic, and perfectly situated for exploring Dublin. There's a sweet breakfast spot a couple blocks away, too. 

We especially enjoyed the people-watching vantage point (i.e., living room) as walkers, commuters, and even a gaggle of kayakers took advantage of the canal directly in front of the apartment. Wendy was a wonderful host, going the extra mile to help us solve transportation puzzles and allowing us to check in early. It clearly *mattered* to her that we enjoy our stay to the fullest.

Highly recommend!"
7541239,538952013,9/30/2019,"Wendy was a great hostess.  She sent step by step instructions before we arrived.  His responses have always been very quick and extremely courteous.  Your apartment is perfect, particularly very well located, comfortable, clean and well equipped with everything we need.  The ad faithfully reflects the characteristics of the apartment.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone planning to visit Dublin."
7541239,544489040,10/10/2019,Nicely located in the heart of Dublin. Wendy was very helpful with tips and things to do in the area.
7541239,545482785,10/12/2019,"Definitely best Airbnb I stayed in. Wendy was very helpful with check-in even though we arrived at like 1 AM. The house is very beautiful and comfortable. It felt cozy and stylish. Everything we needed was available and we felt like we're at home. I literally have nothing bad to say, everything was just perfect! 

Wendy is a great host. She greeted us after a long day of work and traveling and she is a very nice person overall. We really loved how caring and helpful she is."
7541239,550788740,10/19/2019,"Wendy made our stay in Dublin really enjoyable. She helped us to appreciate the city by taking the time to inform us of the various activities according to our interests. She also contacted us frequently so that we find the appartment housing easily. The accommodation is fantastic, very large, very well furnished and located close to the main points of interest and public transport. We highly recommend this accommodation!"
7541239,555983751,10/28/2019,"Great apartment.  We loved our visit and Wendy was a fantastic host.   About a 20 minute walk into the central part of Dublin. Bus system is great.  Very easy to use.  At night, I would recommend a cab to go back to the apt especially for women traveling alone.  Daylight travel was fine by myself either walking or taking bus.  Lovely apartment!"
7541239,557953953,11/2/2019,"Oh goodness, where do I even start? Everything was amazing. Above expectations, remarkable, wonderful. Read on for the details:

First of all, Wendy is a fantastic host. She made us feel so welcome, greeting us with scones and tea, personally providing recommendations for city experiences based on our interests, and even helping us with travel arrangements like getting tickets for local museums and calling a taxi for us when we needed to depart for the airport. Highly personalized attention! Absolutely wonderful. 

And then there is the apartment itself! Great kitchen - plenty of room to cook your own meals with a small grocer just up the road within walking distance. Fireplace was such a nice amenity during the chilly October evenings we spent there. Bed was comfy and everything was very clean!

Location is also prime. Enough distance outside of the city that it isnt noisy but close enough that a bus/tram fare into the heart of Dublin will only run you approx. ‚Ç¨2.50 each way. Wendy also provided us with leap cards that made public transit an easy and stress free method of commuting (because taxis are nice but they get expensive!).

10/10 recommend Wendy's place!"
7541239,560334963,11/6/2019,"Great centrally located apartment from which to explore Dublin. Da Mimmo, the Italian restaurant up the road, is a must. Amazing food and service but best to call ahead for a reservation. 
Wendy is a great host making sure you have everything you need including travel cards to use on public transport. Super comfortable and makes you feel like youre at home."
7541239,563307253,11/12/2019,"Everything about this apartment is wonderful.  Wendy is warm, welcoming and very helpful.  The apartment is conveniently located between the airport and downtown.  The neighborhood is very quiet.  It is about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College, but public transportation is close by and taxis are readily available if you do not want to walk.  A taxi to/from the airport takes about 20 minutes and costs less than 25 euro.  Wendy provided breakfast food and snacks along with coffee, tea and juice.   She also provided many excellent recommendations for restaurants and shops.  Cloud Cafe was a great place for brunch, just a short walk away.  Da Mimmo was also great for a pizza when we were tired from a long day of sightseeing.  The fireplace was great, especially since we visited in cool rainy weather.  We will definitely be staying here again and will be recommending Wendys place to all of our friends."
7541239,565302779,11/17/2019,A wonderful place - Wendy was so welcoming and it was a great little stay away from the craziness of Dublin City centre. Thank you!

Anthony is an amazing host, he has good advises for everything : places to go to eat (even what to order), places to visit and the better way to go to those places. 
Breakfast is ready when you wake up with fantastic homemade soda bread, jams, marmelade, cereals, berries, and of course coffee or tea. 
I had a perfect experience with this Airbnb and I highly recommand it."
7586899,463850408,6/4/2019,"This Airbnb is a little bit different in that it is hosted and you are provided with breakfast. I was accommodated in a very well appointed room with a bathroom directly opposite for my sole use. The quality of the bedding is very good as is the bathroom which has an excellent shower over a sunken bath. 

The breakfast is excellent and on offer is a range of cereals, excellent coffee from a very cool integrated bean to coffee machine. The bread is homemade as is the peanut butter. The host potters around and strikes a perfect balance between leaving guests to enjoy the breakfast while providing useful advice and information on the local area and Dublin.  Anthonys knowledge is great. 

In advance of arrival, Anthonys communication was excellent, relevant and clear. Its hard to see how this hosted accommodation could have been any better. Thank you so much, Anthony."

7586899,516467402,8/24/2019,"If I could rate value as a 10 instead of a 5 I would.  From the home made bread, to the tips on where to go to the feeling of being a part of the wonderful beautiful family and soulful dog Barney that lives in this gorgeous house for the short time that we were there.  Walking distance to the train station... we could go anywhere!  Walking distance to the ocean!   I believe this air b&b is underpriced, but dont tell anyone!  Especially the owners .  If I ever visit Ireland again I would seek this one out."
7586899,518139809,8/26/2019,"Anthony and Cathy are very friendly and welcoming.

Our bed was quite comfortable and the room was clean and tidy. His dog Barney is really friendly and playful."
7586899,525985331,9/8/2019,We had a lovely stay with Tony.  The house is lovely and in quiet location.  There is a relaxed feeling to the place and lots of time for talk and banter! Do stay here and hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
7586899,532166309,9/19/2019,"Anthony very kindly accepted me as a last minute booking and picked me up at the train station. The accommodation is very clean and stylish, bed is super comfortable and the bathroom fabulous. Anthony was a wonderful host, very responsive and warm. The location was lovely, it's a nice walk to the train station (15-20 mins) with a cut through to the beach which I happened upon and delighted in each morning on my way to the city for work. Absolutely delightful stay, wonderful accommodation, really great host. I have no hesitation recommending this as your AirBnB of choice and I hope to be able to revisit."
7586899,538031405,9/29/2019,Perfect home away from home. Great hospitality. The location is the most comfortable & peaceful.

7586899,544568885,10/10/2019,"My stay here was absolutely wonderful - the room was immaculately clean and comfortable, as well as very pretty. The bathroom is a nice size and the shower/water pressure is terrific. The location was fantastic for me as while it was within walking distance from the DART, it also had a great deal of charm to it and felt very idyllic. Breakfast was definitely a highlight as well - I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful homemade bread and peanut butter! They are lovely hosts and are a wealth of knowledge and good nature. I cant think of a more lovely place to stay!"
7590197,451940430,5/12/2019,"The place is located in a quiet neighborhood, about 20 minutes with public transport away from the city center. 
Checking  in and out was easy thanks to Micheal's quick responses and care."
7590197,457586533,5/24/2019,"Michael's bnb was very clean and accommodating during our 11 days there. The location was easy walking distance to public transportation, set in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Michael was quick to respond to the reservation request and all our questions upon arrival.  We truly enjoyed our stay"
7590197,458739873,5/26/2019,"Micheals place is great, location is perfect only a short tram into the city. Lovely and tidy, everything you need. Had amazing weekend in Dublin."
7590197,477003252,6/27/2019,"I highly recommend this accommodation,definitely I will book again if I will work around that area."
7590197,480209962,7/2/2019,Great location a 5 minute walk to the light rail which takes you into the heart of Dublin in 12 minutes or so. Apartment was big enough for our party of 5 .
7590197,484641130,7/9/2019,"Michael's place in Drimnagh is great! We had a group of five, and it worked well for all of us. It is located a short walk away from a Luas Red Line stop, which you can use to get into the city center of Dublin. We also had a rental car, so the location a little ways out of the city center was convenient for us to drive to and from as well. 

Michael was quick to answer any questions we had along the way, and he was able to give us an extra set of keys, which made it easier for our group to split up when we wanted."
7590197,494457828,7/24/2019,Nice place. Perfect for our family trip.
7590197,509436348,8/14/2019,"We are seasoned airbnb guests and this was, unfortunately, our worst experience. Luckily, the other airbnbs we stayed in for the remainder of our trip were fantastic and super clean.
Our friends said the pictures on airbnb reminded them of online dating - not showing accuracy of how tired the carpet and furniture looked. My first comment of the place was it reminded me of a frat house including the strong smell of marijuana when we got out of taxi.  Our friends said they didn't think the sheets had been washed properly because pillow cases smelled like women's perfume and sheets smelled like they had been in washer too long.  Towels were clean, but old.

We arrived after being up 24 hours from travel and there was one roll of toilet paper for 4 people in a 2 bathroom unit. 

When Micheal showed up at the unit the next day he was highly defensive,  arrogant and rude. He yelled, ""Get OUT!""  He could have handled it so much better by asking, ""Can you show me what is dirty?""  
His communication was generally quick, but the toilet paper and paper towels didn't show up until we were packed and ready to leave. We stayed less than 24 hours cutting our stay by 2 days. Finding a new place and moving our stuff took valuable vacation time away from the four of us. 
After we complained to airbnb, Micheal said his tenants on first floor complained of loud music. We are in our 60s,  we had been up 24 hours and never even turned the tv on.  Total fabrication.
It was conveniently located close enough to city centre. We walked 5-7 minutes to the Dublin Luas Black Horse station which was a few blocks from property.  
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

The distance to the train was accurate and that was helpful. We learned from locals and from researching crime in the area that Drimnagh isn't considered the best area and has had gang crime. You can research this yourself by using search term (Drimnagh Crime.) The impact was cabs wouldn't pick us up. We had 4 cabs cancel on us when they learned pickup address. The girl at the hotel told us she was afraid to park her car in Drimnagh for fear her tires would be stolen.
We knew going in that it was a moderately priced airbnb not upscale. Had it been clean, we would have stayed the entire time."
7590197,511506931,8/17/2019,Very convenient place to visit Dublin City. Luas stop close by and not very expensive. Guinness storehouse very close. More than adequate place for 5 people. Michael was very considerate and prompt in answering questions. Hot water very good and beds good. Just a few upgrades to the fittings will make it a lovely place. Thank you for your hospitality
7590197,518327283,8/26/2019,"This flat was in a peaceful area, yet convenient to a grocery store. Thoughtful amenities made the stay perfect. Will definitely recommend."
7590197,520273782,8/30/2019,This host is not cooperative at all and he does not provide the residents all what they need and he doesn't respect the residents

7616541,420289788,3/6/2019,Lilac Cottage was perfect central hub for my girlfriend and I in Ireland.

The cabin was great for winding down at the end of the day and was stocked with DVDs and some books! 

Fidelmas welcomed us not too long after we arrived and let us know that she was there if we needed anything!

7630788,545470397,10/12/2019,"Staying at Paul and Debbie's was a delight.  The central location was the main selling point for us, as we wanted to be able to walk to as many local attractions as possible.  Bus and train access was also immediately available for those days we took tours or ventured a little out into the country side.  The unit itself also had everything we needed for our week in Dublin.  Kitchen , washer and dryer, TV and 2 comfortable bed rooms kept us fed, clean, entertained, and well rested.  And Paul was quick to answer the few questions we did have (by email, we knew he was in a very different time zone)."
7630788,547512246,10/15/2019,"Absolutely incredible location!!  Everything was as described. Clean, comfortable and easily accessible to everything. Could not have been happier with our accommodations. Thank you to Paul and we would recommend this apartment wholeheartedly!!"

7631467,526607354,9/9/2019,The apartment is in a great location. We never felt unsafe and the train is right outside that goes into Dublin. The view is amazing from the huge deck and the apartment was very clean. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone.
7631467,532620138,9/20/2019,"We stayed at this apartment for a week while visiting touring around Dublin. The apartment is a 1 minute walk from the street car stop which runs very frequently. There was a review about it being in a shady area and we didnt get that vibe at all. For the price of this apartment you cant beat the location, amenities."
7631467,558635178,11/3/2019,Nice flat with a nice view.
7673096,473306231,6/21/2019,"Liz n Steve were gresr Hists and made us feel right at home, Bus right outside the door  and local knowledge was fabulous. Recommend anytime..."

7673096,510666714,8/16/2019,"We enjoyed our stay at Liz's place. The breakfast provided was wonderful with homemade bread, and Liz gave very helpful tips for locations to visit. The washroom was smaller than expected but if you have no accessibility requirements it should not be a major issue. Overall it was a lovely experience and fit our needs nicely!"
7683106,560997045,11/8/2019,"Hello Danny, Thanks for being a great host, it was staying at home for me , very secured, great amenities, centrally located"

7692164,428960438,3/26/2019,Ali was a great host. Gave us super detailed instructions to ensure that we arrive correctly. Everything is reachable by a short walk from the apartment.
7692164,445509625,4/29/2019,"My sister and i had a great stay at Alis. It is very well located (about a 15-20 min walk to multiple cathedrals, bars, restaurants, and other attractions). Her place was very clean and she even left us a bit of food for breakfast. Overall great stay."
7692164,487530428,7/14/2019,"Muy  bien ubicado, a un paso del centro y en un barrio con mucho encanto. Muy bien de precio, y con todo lo necesario. Ali muy atenta a nuestra llegada, y respondiendo a todas las cuestiones que le planteamos. Lo recomiendo sin duda!"
7692164,504228352,8/7/2019,"Ali's place is cozy and nice , and she is kind and frendly host. She prepared lot of information and advices for our journey. Great location out of crowd but near to everything. Highly recomended!"
7692164,543147822,10/7/2019,"I enjoyed my stay at Ali's home.  She was very prompt in her responses to my emails and even though she'd be out of town when I arrived, she arranged to have her dad meet me at the apartment and get me situated.  She also made sure I had the essentials for breakfast.  The apartment itself is not as close to the city center as I expected but the bus stops to and from the center were very close to the apartment.  I had a Leap Visitor card and though it was a 20-30 min between buses, it all worked out.  I'd recommend her place to anyone wanting a quiet and comfortable place to stay in Dublin."
7706953,502900357,8/5/2019,A lovely bright room in quiet area but with fantastic access to the South Dublin seaside. A delicious and most welcome light breakfast every morning!

7737502,422844382,3/12/2019,"Amazing location - the train could not be more convenient, and there was a lot of great stuff within a few minutes walk if you want to stay closer to home. The apartment has everything you need for a very comfortable stay, and Michael is *very* responsive to any questions. I'd definitely stay here again on my next Dublin visit."
7737502,425915802,3/19/2019,We stayed at Michaels for St. Patricks Day and it was amazing! The studio looked just as described. The place is far enough outside of the city centre so we were not bothered by crazy crowds but right across from some bus stops to easily get into the city quickly. We would recommend this place for anyone staying in Dublin!
7737502,430970210,3/31/2019,"Michael is a great bloke, really quick to respond to any questions and was there to meet us.
Parking is excellent, to the side and free. Which means you can walk into dublin, we walked to botanic gardens, chester beaty library, jameson distillery and pubs etc.
Apartment itself is in a building with several other apartments so there is a bit of noise from them, not too much tho. 
Wifi, shower, tv all fine, no problems. Grateful for this place to stay for a family wedding."
7737502,434114692,4/7/2019,"We had a great time in this apartment! It's exactly as described, small but had everything we needed (including some snacks, everything needed for the bathroom, etc). Communication, check-in and check-out were very smooth (Michael even let us check-out late since he didn't have any guests). Michael was very nice to provide a list of suggestions for places in the neighborhood. Would definitely recommend!"
7737502,442441702,4/23/2019,Amazing apartment right off the Luas and not too far from the bus station. Place was so clean and cant beat the amenities! Michael has some great recommendations on where to go and what to do.
7737502,443999622,4/27/2019,The house was cosy and super lovely. Much better than we did expect. There's a LUAS (tram) stop just opposite which takes you to the city centre in less than 15 minutes. Would absolutely recommend and repeat if I were to come back in Dublin. Michael and John were really nice and attentive.
7737502,451948668,5/12/2019,Michaels place was equipped with everything we needed. It was very clean and located right next to a tram station in a quite neighborhood. We would definitely come back again!
7737502,454066794,5/17/2019,"We had a lovely stay at Michaels place during our 4-day visit to Dublin. Check-in was easy and quick. The neighborhood was nice and quiet but still close enough to walk to the city center in about 20 minutes. Theres also a LUAS station right across the street as well as easy access to buses. Michael had a ton of great suggestions on restaurants, pubs, and things to do. We also discovered Two Boys Brew, a 5 minute walk away, which had excellent breakfast and coffee. All in all, a fantastic stay and highly recommend!"
7737502,457095882,5/23/2019,"We had a lovely stay at Michaels place. Check in was easy, the apartment was clean and well equipped. Michael was very kind and suggested us some pubs and restaurants. The apartment is located in phibsborough. Its easy to reach the city center with the tram, there is a tram stop right across the street. Highly recommended!"
7737502,459243505,5/27/2019,"Nice and cozy flat! Perfect for two. Great bakery nearby, and the flat is only a few steps away from the tram station to take you into the city center!"
7737502,461827096,6/1/2019,Recomended
7737502,465781812,6/8/2019,Gute Lage und alles Notwendige vorhanden. Kann man auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen!
7737502,468008179,6/11/2019,The apartment was perfect for our stay. It was very clean and in the apartment we had everything we need. The location is just great. Easy to get to the city center and to the airport. Michael gave us helpful recommendations in the nearby area. We had a great stay and highly recommend this accommodation.
7737502,473277897,6/21/2019,"This is a very clean, quiet and cozy room convenient to the Luas. Its got old Dublin area charm with some do not missù local pubs (Gravediggers) and bakery (Clarkes) within walking distance."

7737502,503052039,8/5/2019,"This place is a gem. On the north side of Dublin, it is close to the train which takes you quickly into the city downtown where you can walk just about anywhere. We enjoyed coming back to our Airbnb which was our own spot.  The bed was comfy and we enjoyed having the window open for. A light breeze.  There is a TV but we never used it. We liked having our own fridge, and range for cooking. We went to a nearby Tesco (a 20 minute walk) and got a few things for sandwiches, snacks and it was nice having a place for them in the house. Coming from America, it was unique having the toilet separate from the shower, but that was also really nice. Lastly, Michaels recommendations were great and his directions were excellent. He replied pretty quick and we were so glad we stayed there and not in a hotel. Hoping to come back soon."
7737502,505472061,8/9/2019,"The space and location were great! Right on the train line, which made it very convenient. Michael was easy to communicate with and helpful. Would highly recommend staying here!"

7738695,421815009,3/10/2019,Great location and amenities. Kate and Barry were excellent hosts.
7738695,423842499,3/15/2019,"Barry, Kate,
Well all I can say .....its been (Website hidden by Airbnb) Vinnie Jones moment ...All the best !!!"
7738695,430296531,3/30/2019,"Do yourself a favor and stay with Barry! The hotel-like room makes up for the not -in-city-centerù location. He is really helpful, welcoming, and makes sure you feel right at home!"
7738695,442339942,4/23/2019,"Barry and Kate are good-vibes hosts. Their house is nice and tidy and located in very lovely neighborhood. From the beginning, I felt very welcome and I enjoyed the chats over cup of tea. :) I would definitely recommend staying at Barry's place if you are planning a stay in Dublin."
7738695,460097172,5/28/2019,Barry and Kate are wonderful human beings and so very friendly. You won't find anywhere better
7738695,461807492,6/1/2019,"Berry's accomodation was perfect for us.  very nice contact, check in very pleasant and the room with the mattress bed very very comfortable, we really felt welcome.  highly recommended! Thanks"
7738695,465825070,6/8/2019,Barry was very hospitable and friendly. Quiet neighborhood with easy access via bus to city center. Stylish and clean place.

7738695,534984776,9/23/2019,"Nice room very close to the center of Dublin 
And a super nice host"
7738695,539843839,10/2/2019,"Our stay at Barry's was overall great. We received some good advice on the city transport so that even though the place isn't directly in the centre, getting to the city or airport couldn't be easier. 
The house was very lovely and conveniently located, basically all you need (shops, restaurants, pubs) is in 5 minutes walking distance. 
We'll be happy to visit again."
7738695,543780747,10/8/2019,I recommend Barry and his place for everyone who is looking for an authentic Irish experience. The flat is well furnished and the host made sure that our needs are met. We really enjoyed our stay.
7740402,425463769,3/18/2019,Great place for a quick stay! Next to train for Dublin which was very convienent
7740402,427966940,3/24/2019,Had a great stay here! It was very close to the train and bus station making it very easy to get to the airport and to the center of Dublin! The place was great and was exactly as described. Inese was very quick to respond to any questions making our stay quite pleasant. Would absolutely recommend to all and i would definitely stay here again!
7740402,430960661,3/31/2019,"It was a great stay. The house is near the DART station, but it isn't disturbing. Close to shop and cafe. Really recommend."
7740402,435443959,4/10/2019,"A few good things about this place is that it is close to the Railway link to the city centre and has parking on premises. 

Our check in was meant to be at 3 PM but the host messaged to say that the room will be ready only at 5PM. We were driving down from Dublin so we requested for the check in at 3PM as on the website but the host simply said NO and was not apologetic at all. We had to change our schedule and arrive later because of this. Tried to reach her on the mobile but the calls were unanswered and went to voicemail. 

The room is quite small and not well decorated. Its just a room with beds. No control over heating as well. There is a roof  window for skylight but it cannot be covered so be ready for sunlight whether you like it or not.

The bathroom was just messy. The hand shower was just leaking all over the place.

We were not even received by the host. Her husband let us in and gave us the keys to the room. Inese did not even think it was necessary to come and explain about the check in goof up on her part.

Our recommendation would be to avoid this place."
7740402,437167435,4/14/2019,Very nice accommodation near the train station ! The decoration is really pretty and the host is very nice !
7740402,440897074,4/21/2019,"Ottima posizione per i servizi pubblici.  Spartana ,  molto graziosa la stanza, una vera casa irlandese.."
7740402,451277597,5/11/2019,"Ineses place located in a very comfortable place which is between Howth and Dublin. The train station is literally next to the house so its convenient to go to Dublin City centre and Howth. 

Inese and Alex are nice and helpful as well. I will recommend others to select their place."
7740402,452964903,5/14/2019,Nice place exactly as expected and as described. Close to train station for easy traveling. Suites close to beautiful area.
7740402,459983427,5/28/2019,Triple room was great for the 3 of us! Location is great for walking to Howth and right by the train for a quick trip to central Dublin. Clean and lovely!
7740402,463492057,6/3/2019,The place looked just like the pictures. The location was absolutely perfect. Pretty close to Dublin city center and to the airport. It was nice that it wasnt in the city. Plenty of things to walk to and see.
7740402,474458105,6/23/2019,Very clean. Good location. Well worth the money
7740402,478736520,6/30/2019,The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious. Stores and restaurants are just a short walk away and the water is viewable from the bathroom.
7740402,480647288,7/3/2019,The room for three had plenty of space and the beds were comfortable. There is only one bathroom for all guests but we didnt find that to be a problem. It takes a bit to get into Dublin but the building is right near the train and the bus to the airport. All in all for sure a good stay for budget travelers!
7740402,486247799,7/12/2019,Sale inadapte
7740402,496407107,7/27/2019,Room is comfortable and location is very good: right beside Sutton train station. From there you can go anywhere in Dublin very fast. Inese was very helpful giving us a lot of useful tips for the city and answering our doubts promptly.
7740402,508658520,8/13/2019,"Inese was a very friendly host, even if we didn't see her very much. The rooms were perfectly clean and there was a bus station close to the house with busses directly to Dublin. Only thing missing was a place to eat, but we knew that before (as it's written in the description). So especially if you're out visiting Dublin all day there's everything you need at Inese's. Thanks for having us!"
7740402,515780682,8/23/2019,Je recommande
7740402,517103095,8/25/2019,"You get what you pay for here. It's basic and very convenient for travel. The Sutton/Howth area is a beautiful place that I definitely hope to visit again! 

We stayed in the room for 3 for 2 nights. This had a double bed and single bed. The single bed you can't see in the pictures but it was there!

The house is quiet except for passing trains but we all slept well. 

I would recommend this if you are just using it as a place to sleep for a couple of nights as it works as a convenient place to stay with no cooking facilities or ""frills"" such as a TV."
7740402,524237983,9/5/2019,"Out room was very clean and the house is located north of Dublin quite close to Sutton Dart station. It takes about 30 minutes to get to the city center from there. Ineses husband was very kind and offered us some local tips. Overall, we had a great stay at their place and I would recommend it to anyone since it is very good value for money although it doesnt have a kitchen (as it is specified) and the fridge is quite small."
7740402,531770321,9/18/2019,"Overall a very simple place to crash. If you are looking for simple and affordable, and plan to spend your time out and about, this works well."
7740402,535819341,9/25/2019,"We already miss that place. Great location, near to everything we've wanted :)"
7740402,539441785,10/1/2019,"Nice spot, great location close to the rail station, easy to get downtown and to the airport"
7740402,540406907,10/3/2019,Very nice stay in Sutton.
7740402,543198249,10/7/2019,Beautiful sea-side scenery close by (Howth) and VERY friendly host/accommodation. Great stay also for Dublin.
7740402,562053485,11/10/2019,Nice place near seashore and railway station. Twenty minutes to get to the city center.
7749107,418531491,3/2/2019,"Joan's place has many amenities near by. Supermarket is nearby, bus stop is near by and it's a short walk to the Guinness storehouse, Teeling distillery and St James Hospital. We stayed 6 weeks and felt it was a little small for us. Place is not very sound proof so can we can hear neighbours's movement upstairs and people talking on the road.  The place is on the small side but would work fine for short term stays."
7749107,421359780,3/9/2019,"This apartment is a  great place to stay as its a stones throw from the centre of the city , Joan very kindly let us in early as our flight landed at 9.30, everything is there that you will need in the kitchen and the beds are lovely and comfy , in the bathroom there is shower gel and lots of washing up liquid in the kitchen, just oppersite is a super market and you can walk to the Guinness factory , we went to Arthurs pub which is just on the corner by the flat and the welcome is super, just a word of warning if you get a taxi from the airport ask how much it is as  we where charged 48 euros to the city and going back to the airport 25 euros a big difference , we walked our little legs off and enjoyed every minute of it and we would stay there again , thank you joan ."
7749107,423160956,3/13/2019,"Had a great time here, perfect location and lovely place!"
7749107,423889194,3/15/2019,"Super clean apartment that is next to very close to great food (Arthur's Pub) and within walking distance of downtown, St Patrick's Cathedral, Guinness, and all of the fun things in Dublin that tourists would like to go to. Thanks so much, Joan!"
7749107,425463211,3/18/2019,The Apartment is very good for a few day long city Trip. I would come to Joan again
7749107,430999992,3/31/2019,"Clean and tidy place, 10 minutes by bus from the city center. Highly recommended to anyone!"
7749107,432535154,4/4/2019,"We enjoyed our stay, great location, everything we needed in one space and close enough for us to walk to all the attractions. If you have trouble sleeping on a hard bed I would maybe ask for an extra comforter to lay down, if you have problems with sleeping in a room where the street light illumination comes through the shade you may want to bring a sleeping mask."
7749107,434085747,4/7/2019,Het appartement is gelegen op een prachtige locatie. Op loopafstand van alle mooie bezienswaardigheden.  Ideaal.
7749107,435448288,4/10/2019,"Joan was a great host her apartment was great with some lovely touches. 
Although not right in the centre it was literally less than five minutes walk from the Guinness brewery!!!
There were bus stops outside to take you into the centre or it was about a fifteen minute walk. 
Right across the road was Arthurs pub good food!
All in had a great couple of days and would certainly book again."
7749107,436121160,4/12/2019,"Great location- we were able to walk to the Book of Kells, St. Stephens Green with no problem, and Guinness Storehouse was especially close. Also close to grocery and other services. The apartment was very clean and provided plenty of space for three people (one couple and a single). Would stay again."
7749107,439095841,4/18/2019,The stay at the Apartment was exactly like we thought. Everything was good.
7749107,440073048,4/20/2019,"Basic apartment, good location- perfect for walking around Dublin and with paid parking in easy reach. Only downside is the beds were a little uncomfortable if staying for more than one night but otherwise this airbnb is great value for money. Thanks Joan!"
7749107,442709820,4/24/2019,"Joan was very hospitable and was there to greet us.  The location was great for sight-seers who enjoy walking. Buses were handy but we didnt need them. 

Its located on a busy street so be prepared for some noise at night.  Very friendly neighbourhood, especially at Arthurs pub beside the church."
7749107,444706950,4/28/2019,Muito bem localizado. O pequeno almoco tinha pouca coisa
7749107,449359311,5/6/2019,Very pleased with the apartment! A good location as its near the Guinness factory and there is a taxi port right outside. Things like shower wash and shampoo were provided which was great.
7749107,449756483,5/7/2019,"Good location. Walk to everything. On a busy street, but surprisingly not that loud. The beds were not that comfortable and made a bit of noise. But besides that, nice place!"
7749107,452881512,5/14/2019,"Joan's place is in a nice location if you want to be near shops, grocers, bars, etc. It's a bit challenging working out meeting Joan."
7749107,453260992,5/15/2019,"We were just staying one day and was great for the job. Good facilities and great location near temple bar, Olympia theatre and Guinness storehouse"
7749107,454377761,5/18/2019,Great place and host!
7749107,456730494,5/22/2019,"Joan's flat was located in an excellent part of the city, easily accessible to everything. We had a great time in the city"
7749107,457590327,5/24/2019,"Joan was excellent at assisting weary travelers, great location to walk about!"
7749107,458021884,5/25/2019,Joans place is lovely. We had a very nice one night stay there. The pictures are very accurate. Joan was a pleasure to communicate with and was very helpful in person.
7749107,459987665,5/28/2019,"A great centrally located place for ant traveler!
Very clean and comfortable.
Had a great stay!!"
7749107,461317934,5/31/2019,"Every thing was as presented in the Airbnb listing, great location and a good value."
7749107,463850548,6/4/2019,"Great place to stay, very clean apartment with everything you need."
7749107,464661689,6/6/2019,clean basic appartment that is walking distance to many of Dublin's attractions
7749107,467958822,6/11/2019,"Cleanest BnB we stayed at in Ireland. Had coffee, tea and snacks in the kitchen. WiFi was out when we were there and there's no TV if you need a break from the pub and a night in."
7749107,469352258,6/14/2019,"Joan's apartment was great.  We were within walking distance to the Guiness Storehouse, Teeling Distillery, Trinity College, the Temple Bar district, and Kilmainham Gaol.  We had all we needed at the apartment except for the wi-fi which was not working during our stay."
7749107,470589524,6/16/2019,"Great apartment in a great location. Guiness Storehouse just a short walk, bus line stops directly in front of apartment. Arthurs pub was an instant favorite. The food is good and the staff made us feel like locals. The lovely smell from the Bakery downstairs is an added bonus.
The only reason I didnt give Joans apartment 5 stars is the WiFi was not available during our stay. Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin."
7749107,475955641,6/25/2019,"Great 2 bed and 2 bathroom place, an amazing location Dublin is expensive but this was really a great location and Athurs pub was good food and value for your money! Hospitality at Athurs pub and the cookie shop just around the corner was exceptional! Joan is on time but there was no place to store luggage...but she did her best to book us in ASAP!"
7749107,477025719,6/27/2019,"Very lovely apartment, and great location."
7749107,479662344,7/1/2019,Nice flat and great location - able to walk to many attractions and steps away from grocery store and bakery/cafes.  No Television in flat. Noise from busy street can be heard in bedrooms.
7749107,484021982,7/8/2019,"The space is exactly as described, felt a little rushed at check in. The location is perfect and walking distance to everything. We didn't have access to the balcony. The side street is not ideal but we were fine. Can be noisy at night. I would stay again the flat again is amazing and close to all the sites u want to hit."
7749107,486314955,7/12/2019,"Nice location, clean, with a nice kitchen.  Breakfast wasn't what we expected:  instant coffee and dry cereal with no milk available in the kitchen.  We had some communication issues with luggage drop off but were accommodated.  The hot water is on a timer."
7749107,486873538,7/13/2019,"Lovely space in a great location! There's a really great cookie/coffee shop downstairs, and a Tesco just down the street. Very walkable."
7749107,490324962,7/18/2019,Spacious apartment with everything you need in a fantastic location.  Joan was super helpful and very responsive as a host.  Couldnt have had a better experience!
7749107,490863126,7/19/2019,Great location! Close to everything in Temple Bar. Very clean and tidy. Quite a few steps up to apartment. Entrance is on a side street/alley so just know to look there. Enjoyed very much.
7749107,493206600,7/22/2019,Great location to be when you want to visit Dublin. Just pick up the Hop On/Off bus at the Guinness Storehouse(5 minutes walking from the flat) and use it to go places!
7749107,495719245,7/26/2019,"Joan was very responsive and met us at the apartment to show us how things worked. It was a clean and cozy little place but if you come while its warmer, you will have to open the windows that dont have any screens, thus we had many flys inside, and the bus stop right outside the bedrooms was very loud all night. The location was great for being in close proximity to walk to the city. Overall it worked well for us but light sleepers, make sure to bring ear plugs!"
7749107,501196683,8/3/2019,"This spot is close to city center, about 15 minute walk to St. Patrick's Cathedral and other sights. It was very clean and well furnished and although on a city street, felt very safe with two locks-one at the street door, and another to the apartment itself.  The street is interesting to walk, with many little shops and a really good bakery only a 5 minute walk away.  Great value."
7749107,508808481,8/13/2019,"Clean, centrally located apartment, within 15-20min walk to so many places I wanted to visit.  Other amenities such as a grocery store were so close too!"
7749107,511387320,8/17/2019,"The Apt was very clean. The internet was spotty at best which can make it difficult for a traveler to book and investigate places to visit. The location was central to everything but it was loud. That being said, it is a city and the nightlife is active so its to be expected. We had a lovely time and cant wait to visit Ireland again."
7749107,513278618,8/19/2019,Lovely apartment in a great location. Easy walking distance to the Guinness Storehouse and other wonderful points of interest. Great pub around the corner!
7749107,514928820,8/22/2019,Great location for a short stay in Dublin.
7749107,518318661,8/26/2019,"It's an ok place to stay but we wouldn't book this accommodation again! 

There are certainly a few things that need updating in this flat. The worst bit for us was the shower situation - we specifically booked a place with two bathrooms and two working showers for a good reason... but we ended up with only one shower kind of working ( it had very weak water pressure, awful if you try to rinse off shampoo from long hair). We have been made aware of the broken second shower two days before arrival and let Joan know that this is very inconvenient for us. We received a small discount after contacting Airbnb with the  issue but would have preferred a working shower. Apparently she couldn't fix it as the apartment was fully booked for the whole week but one could have at least tried it since we only arrived in the evening - that made a minimum of 9 hours to get a plumber in.

Anyways, apart from that there have been a few other issues with the flat regarding cleanliness (spider webs on the ceilings, dusty) and a weird smell in the whole house (we couldn't figure out where it came from). The beds are very uncomfortable and there are multiple lose or broken appliances - one of the armchairs in the living room e.g. is broken and can't be used. Also, the flat in general is not soundproofed at all - bring some ear plugs for the night."
7749107,519406365,8/28/2019,"Flat ok some improvement on cleaning would be great
Overall nice stay"
7749107,520921753,8/31/2019,"Dublin is extremely expensive so other places are likely even more expensive. However, despite this apartment being newù, the furniture is obviously not. The beds are noisy, the handles on the doors fell off and the overall quality of the furnishings is low. No television and though the city is within walking distance, the neighborhood is not great."
7749107,524631637,9/6/2019,"Joans place could not be better located! We were on a quiet side street within walking distance to tons of restaurants, cafes, tourist attractions, and other hotspots. With two bathrooms, the apartment was easily comfortable for 4 adult guests. A great, central location for anyone looking to explore Dublin."
7749107,526018898,9/8/2019,My 3 friends and I stayed in Joans place for two nights. It was a great flat for 4. Each bedroom has its own bathroom. Sadly one shower wasnt working. The flat is a 20 minute foot walk from grafton street and temple bar.
7749107,527233191,9/10/2019,"The location is excellent, lots of walkable attractions/cheap taxis/and - like everyone else says - our favorite bar in Dublin was right across the street! 

We were very disappointed, though, by the fact that we were notified ON WALKING IN the apt to get the keys that one shower was not working. I understand these things happen, but upon reading through the other reviews on Joans listing, it became clear that this is not a new issue. Other reviewers tell an oddly similar story. When we expressed our disappointment at being charged the 2 br/2 ba price anyway, Joan again doubled down on the fact that this is the first time theyve had to shut off the shower - which simply isnt true. The refund she sent was tiny (as was the refund sent to other reviewers.)

The beds are hard, but nothing crazy. The one other weird thing is a garbage smell that you cant quite get used to in most of the common areas."
7749107,532301414,9/19/2019,"Joans apartment is very clean and comfortable.  I would stay here again.  It is right beside St Catherines church, close to Guinness Storehouse, ChristChurch .  Cafe & Dessert bar is directly in front of the apartment . Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches, etc.  Arthurs pub is just at the corner and Excellent food.  Loved the seafood chowder!  Walking distance to train station and lots of bus options."
7749107,533898643,9/22/2019,"Very clean, great location, easily accessed by foot all the sites of Dublin"
7749107,540365858,10/3/2019,Cannot recommend this flat enough. Great location. Looks and feels brand new and has everything you could possibly need including cereal and coffee/tea for breakfast. Would stay here again during our next trip to Dublin. A perfect spot for 2 couples since there is an en suite bathroom and a other bathroom for the second bedroom.
7749107,540976304,10/4/2019,"Joans place was easy to get to and check in was very accommodating. Location is within walking distances to Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, etc., and nearly around the corner from The Guinness Storehouse. Place was very clean and had everything we needed!"
7749107,546016124,10/13/2019,"Accommodation was still dirty, hairs were left in bedroom and bathroom. Bed linen had marks on already. A bit of a walk to the city centre"
7749107,551532357,10/20/2019,"Great location, easy walking distance to many of Dublins attractions.  Bus stop and taxi stop outside. Lovely and clean, bathroom and en-suite was great for three of us. Could easily accomodate 4. Joan supplies tea, coffee, cereal and sugar as well as some toiletries. The only downside was a musty smell at times. Not sure where that was coming from. Lots of pubs, restaurants, shops and bars nearby."
7749107,555069191,10/27/2019,"Great Flat in Central Dublin. Joan was a great host, and the little touches like tea, coffee, and cereals were much appreciated. Would 100% recommend."
7749107,557161309,10/31/2019,Joan was great!  We werent in Dublin long but I wish we could have stayed longer in Joans place.  The location is great and she had so many suggestions of things to do and see!  The two bathrooms felt very luxurious as well.  Joan was helpful and kindîI would definitely stay again!
7749107,557524913,11/1/2019,Nice appartment in the heart of Dublin. The appartment is a good value and the communication with Joan is very smoothly
7749107,559540416,11/4/2019,"This apartment is in an excellent and convenient location. Its handy to Heuston Station, and the central part of Dublin.  Arthurs is a very nice pub and restaurant just a 100 feet away.  The apartment is spotless,  and has a very functional kitchen.  Joan communicates very promptly.  We appreciated her meeting us at checkin to review what we needed to know. I would recommend Joans apartment."
7749107,562033441,11/10/2019,Joan is great and so is her place!  Great location for exploring Dublin and check in/checkout was extremely easy. We would love to come back.
7749107,568308914,11/24/2019,Nice smart apartment in great location
7751629,420283707,3/6/2019,Great stay in this very well located appartment
7751629,427796326,3/24/2019,"Amazing views of the city and Saint Patricks from the balcony and great location, ten minute walk to Temple Bar area. Spacious and clean with comfortable beds, enough for our group of 6 to fit easily"
7751629,450836064,5/10/2019,We had an amazing stay!  The location was very walkable.  Thank you!!
7751629,458012618,5/25/2019,Really spacious apartment with a great balcony in a fantastic location would definitely stay again.
7751629,490255776,7/18/2019,"The term superbù is misleading. The views are great, nice hardwood floors, and a great location but the carpets in the bedrooms are faded and the walls are scuffed up.  Plus one of the toilets was out of commission for most of our stay."
7751629,500550368,8/2/2019,Great place!
7751629,503554106,8/6/2019,"This apartment wasn't over Temple Bar, but we were still able to walk a bit to it, as well as other attractions. There was a lot of room for extra people, 5 roll away beds and bedding. The host who met us was extremely nice and helpful. Our only complaint would be that we had 1 less bathroom than expected for a group of 9. They had a flood and the bathroom was closed. The flooring was also ruined and bumpy. The kitchen and view was beautiful!"
7751629,506349908,8/10/2019,Great location.
7751629,509941084,8/15/2019,We really enjoyed the location and the amenities of this property. One of the biggest surprises was the wonderful Bosch built-in coffee maker. It really made the place.  We were able to fit 7 people very comfortably.  We were able to walk to everything from this site.
7751629,514943169,8/22/2019,"This is a really nice condo, with the kitchen and living room on the 5th floor, and the three bedrooms and two bathrooms on the floor below.  So the view is really nice out the front.  The steps to the lower floor are a bit steep, so if you have troubles with stairs, this may not be the best place.  Getting in and out of the unit is easy;  we were going to have a car rental, but decided it would be too much of a hassle to drive in Dublin, and we were right about that.   I'm not sure how convenient the parking would be or the cost.  You're within a 15 to 20 minute walk to the temple bar area and Trinity College, and maybe a bit longer to the Guinness storehouse, which you can see from the porch off of the living room. Stephens Green is about a 5 minute walk.

We only used the kitchen in the mornings, but it seemed to have anything one would need. Both the coffee maker and dishwasher worked well.  Plenty of hot water, and there were 7 of us.  With the 7th person in our group, she slept on a double cot on the main floor at the end of the dining room.  It may not work for everyone, but it worked for us. 

The taxi ride to and from the airport runs between 25 and 30 euros, and will take 25 to 45 minutes, depending on rush hour.

Adam was our contact person, and he was always prompt to get back with us"
7751629,524696373,9/6/2019,"Great place for a large group who want to be within short walking distance of the Dublin city core. Apartment is as shown in photos with some wear and tear which is to be expected.  Most of the amenities were in working order except for some of the lights in the kitchen and common space - or we didn't know which switch turned those lights on. Regardless, an easy fix for the next guests. Communication was fairly easy and as thorough as it needed to be - nothing extra i.e. no suggestions of places or things to do in Dublin; but this worked for us so no complaints here.   Overall, a great space for a large group with easy access to the city!"
7751629,527263717,9/10/2019,Thank you
7751629,529870055,9/15/2019,Cannot beat the location and works well enough for a large group. Expect some people to be sleeping on cots in the common areas.
7751629,532066714,9/19/2019,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7751629,551568056,10/20/2019,"a very nice Apartment for 6 people, not more. (3 very comfortable double beds, 4 uncomfortable additional fould up beds). All in all I can recommend it for a grup up to 6!"
7759045,427309360,3/23/2019,"Barry was a superb host in his beautiful house. He was extremely welcoming and friendly and made me feel at easy, I felt part of the house from the outset."
7759045,442767252,4/24/2019,"Thank you so much - everything was wonderful! Kate and Barry were very welcoming, friendly and gracious. The room was was very clean and comfortable - and their home is located in a very safe and attractive neighborhood. The 15A bus stop is less than a block away, and will take you directly downtown. Highly recommended!!!"
7759045,446777197,5/2/2019,Oh my goodness. Where can I start? Incredible hospitality. Super responsive. Gave me multiple ways to contact them. Very helpful. Recommended several fun activities. Very great location. Right next to a few different buses. Very comfortable bed. A lot of different amenities. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much to the both of you for everything! :)
7759045,451278241,5/11/2019,Great place at a great location in Dublin. Would recommend. Barry is very helpful as a host . The place is nice
7759045,454508028,5/18/2019,"I had the pleasure of staying at Barrys place for my week-long solo trip to Dublin. Although Terenure is a bit far from City Centre, Barrys place is really close to public transit (about a 3 minute walk to the nearest bus stop; about 20 minutes to City Centre via bus). The room I stayed in was big and bright, and the bathroom was really clean.

Barry goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and at home, and communication is always easy. 

Definitely recommend!"
7759045,460451896,5/29/2019,Barry and Kate are amazing hosts. They provided great tips as well as a list of restaurants/pubs to go to. Any questions you have they were quick to answer. They are both lovely people and I felt at home super quick. The bed was super comfy which was a plus. 10/10 would recommend if you want a great place to stay with genuinely nice people.
7759045,461206999,5/31/2019,"Wish I could add more than 5 stars to this review. Barry was amazing and went out of his way for us. Incredibly friendly and somehow has a 6th sense for when you need a cup of tea! Stay with Barry, youll be happy you did."
7759045,464712342,6/6/2019,"Barry is an excellent host who was quick to reply to our questions and made check-in and staying at his location very easy. 

The house is ideally located for visiting Dublin but not wanting to stay in the city center. It is right off of a main bus line that goes straight into the Dublin city center and to the airport. Also, the city center is walkable from the house. It took us about 45 minutes to walk to city center but it was very enjoyable. There is ample street parking at the location. 

The accommodations are very nice. The house is very well decorated on the inside and the room is large and very comfortable. The bed is big and comfortable. This place is as big and nice as the photos make it seem. The bathroom is shared with the other guest room, but you know that before booking. Shower is nice but there is only hot water some parts of the day (we never had a problem, there was always hot water when we wanted it). 

Unlike some other AirBnBs that advertise a ""kitchen"", the kitchen at Barry's is a real kitchen with a stove, fridge, some basic cooking supplies etc. This really enhanced our stay at Barry's as we had gotten tired of eating out and wanting to cook some of our own food. There was no microwave (or at least I did not find one) but that shouldn't be a problem. 

There is also a clothes washing machine that can be used but no dryer. This is probably only a surprise to American guests (but you can dry your clothes on the radiator). 

Internet is fast."
7759045,469349441,6/14/2019,"Very comfortable room just outside of the Dublin center! Easy to get to everything we wanted to see by bus. The room was spacious and comfy. You do share a bathroom with other guests, but it wasnt too inconvenient. Barry is super nice and welcoming! Would definitely stay here again."
7759045,489791992,7/17/2019,"Its a great place, cozy, a good room with a comfortable bed, the house has everything we need and we can rest and relax freely. The hosts are friendly, organized and helpful. Its next to bus station, a very easy locomotion. We love the stay, and we come back certainly for this place. Thank you !"
7759045,490877903,7/19/2019,"All was great with Barry! He is an awesome lad. Plenty of hosting experience, very genuine and always helpful. The apartment is nice and is located about 15-20 minutes from the city center by bus. Would stay there again."
7759045,499371871,7/31/2019,Barrys place was incredible. First time in Dublin and the location was awesome. Only about a 10 min bus ride to the city center. We felt at home at Barrys place and would recommend 100%.
7759045,504160399,8/7/2019,"Excellent location, lovely host and a really wonderful home. 
Barry is a pleasure to deal with and very hospitable - he went out of his way to facilitate our arrival time, the room was immaculate and the house is really tastefully decorated and very homely. 
5/5, thanks again Barry!"
7759045,510464625,8/16/2019,"This is a lovely place to stay.  The shared bathroom is immaculate and the guest room beautiful and v comfortable.  The local area has an abundance of great places to eat and I found driving to the Aviva stadium in the morning rush hour very, very manageable in August.  I'd definitely stay again the next time I'm in Dublin."
7759045,519729714,8/29/2019,Everything was wonderful & clean! The room was as expected but the cute garden and the kitchen were just awesome :) The hosts were really nice and gave us a lot of good must see tips. Thank you for everything!!
7759045,521647520,9/1/2019,"Barrys place was very nice, the location was excellent with lots of restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Barry was a wonderful host and very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. The room was clean and bed was super comfortable, probably the best nights rest we had the entire trip! Thanks Barry!"
7759045,524159727,9/5/2019,"Barry is a perfect host, the place was cozy and we got some great tips for visiting Dublin. It's a bit outside of Dublin yet it is near a small ""village center"" that has everything you need. Can recommend it!"
7759045,526791222,9/9/2019,"We enjoyed our stay so much at Barry's place. He was so friendly, accommodating, communicative, and helpful on our first stop in Ireland. We hope to stay with them again!"
7759045,528651705,9/13/2019,"Definitely a great place to stay when visiting Dublin. Barrys place is in the area of Terenure. By bus it takes only around 15 min to get to the city center and costs approximately 3 ‚Ç¨. 
We felt very welcome during our stay. Barry provided a quick and easy self-check-in as no one was at the house at our arrival time. He left the lights on so we could find our room easily. Barry always answered quickly to our messages.
The room was nice and cozy and got everything someone could need (even towels & hairdryer).
I would recommend staying here :)"
7759045,532281445,9/19/2019,"Barrys place was incredibly cozy, quiet, clean and you almost feel right at home. Wonderful experience, I highly recommend it;)"
7759045,536716178,9/27/2019,Barry's home was very cozy and felt welcoming! It was a quick bus ride to the city center and very easy to get to with public transport.
7759045,537943831,9/29/2019,"We were speechless. Barrys place is stylish, cozy and clean. Its very close to the city centre by bus and youve got bus stops literally on every corner (although we walked there a couple of times as well which was also really nice). Barry went out of his way to help us whenever we needed him (day or night), and was always beyond nice. He also gave us some great tips and ideas on what to do in Dublin. I cant imagine staying anywhere else when we visit Dublin again."
7759045,540975891,10/4/2019,"Barrys place is in an ideal location. Literally anything you could want or need is in a few minutes walk from the property. Its super clean and the bed is so comfy. Barry is on the ball in replying to messages and any questions you may have. Hes very easy going and considerate of different needs. The house is quiet and ideal for any solo travelers, couples and families alike. Keep in mind theres stairs! The Kitchen is huge and you can use at your leisure. Very easy to get to the city or different parts of the city with public transport on your doorstep. A nice touch would be a TV maybe? Overall I couldnt fault the place or the host "
7759045,546987571,10/14/2019,"The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. The location was handy since it was close to bus routes and we could get a decent breakfast. Additionally, being less than 5 minutes from the local pub was great. Barry was an exceptional host, he made all the essential amenities available, was extremely friendly and even offered to take us to a gig across town. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and we will definitely be back in future!"
7770764,418164553,3/1/2019,Dan is a fantastic host and he has a really lovely place. There's a nice Supervalu near and there's parking outside.

7777436,419645873,3/4/2019,"Very nice apartment, close to direct public transport to airport and to city center (even if everything in the city is at walking distance and we never took public transport). The house is very clean, the check-in/check-out easy and flexible. Fast communication with Gerry. Definitely recommended!"
7777436,421358293,3/9/2019,In short: Great Host! Very clean flat. City Center in walking distance. Very good price. I would definitely recommend.
7777436,424266702,3/16/2019,"The flat is on the ground floor and has access to a back garden, which was an unexpected surprise. It had pretty much everything we needed, including a small kitchen, and was clean and tidy. The location is great, in a quiet residential area, but within 15-30 min walk to most places we wanted to go. There are several grocery shops nearby. Perfect place to come back to after a long day.

Gerry provided a lot of useful info prior to check-in. We had a hiccup at the beginning with getting responses, but we later learned that Gerry was on vacation that weekend. After he returned, he met with us and enthusiastically answered all our questions and gave us an abundance of tips about Dublin. Really glad to have met Gerry and his wife. Our stay only went uphill from there. I would definitely stay here again next time."
7777436,428523880,3/25/2019,"The flat is perfect, better than on photos! Gerry help us to find a place to park our rent car. The street is really calm and flat is really well placed!"

7777436,443519861,4/26/2019,"Clean apartment with a working oven and microwave including pots, pan, kettle, cafetiere and adequate cutlery. (No sharp knife, sieve, tea pot).
We were able to invite friends to eat using crockery/cutlery to set the table. Two garden chairs from outside enabled us all to sit at the kitchen table. When warmer, it would be possible to eat at the garden table.
Warm with heating on in the morning and evening. Individual radiators can be turned off. 
Washing machine available but not used on this occasion.
Very quiet apartment towards the back of the house. Little noise from fellow occupants.
Parking is in the red zone (3 hours only) and at a premium. Gerry advised us of free parking across the canal about 12mins walk from the house.
Convenient to Tesco Express, pharmacy, bars, restaurants and bus. The National Gallery is 25mins walk along the nearby canal, and St Patrick's Cathedral is 15mins walk. Very handy to major attractions and transport.
Enjoyed meeting and chatting with Gerry and his son."
7777436,445468852,4/29/2019,"The perfect apartament for a couple in Dublin, different from the photos but even better!! Located in Portobello, very nice area. 15min walking to St Patricks Catheral, 20-25min. to center-Temple bar, 2min. to bus to airport, parking free after 6.30pm nearby. Very clean. Gerry was very responsive, we could leave our luggage in the apartament after check-out. We have a really nice time!"

The WiFi only works in the front room, not in the bedroom or bathroom. If youre looking to watch Netflix in bed or do a lot of Internet work, just take note that you may not be able to. It was adequate for our purposes of Netflixing and leisurely surfing the web (just one or two devices at a time).

Overall exactly as described in the listing, and very clean!"

7777436,497004418,7/28/2019,"Really great location, not too far from all the best places to eat and drink. Lovely to walk along the canal. The apartment was clean, WiFi not top notch, and bring an eye mask if you get woken up by natural light seeping in. All in all, would certainly recommend!"

Gerry was very quick to respond and his hospitality letting us drop our bags off early when we arrived was much appreciated.
7777436,511541684,8/17/2019,"Wonderful location, great little apartment. Wifi was a little spotty, but wouldn't have been an issue if we'd had phones with better reception in the UK."

7777436,523237734,9/3/2019,"Great time in Dublin. Really appreciated this neighborhood, not only picturesque and serene, but perfectly situated in the close peripheral of central Dublin, so that I could easily and quickly get to all central points via multiple options (I preferred the beautiful walk to central points), and retire peacefully at night in peace and quiet. Super easy directions to all tour pick-up spots and airport transportation close by. The apartment is actually bigger than it looks in pictures. Kitchen was fully equipped, which was great at the start and end of the day for my morning coffee and leftovers in the evening :). Comfy bed and nice linens; I slept great. Wi-Fi was a problem that Gerry was responsive about solving, and although we didnt fully solve it, Gerry said it was a first and would ensure resolve for future guests. Really nice time, thanks Gerry!"

7781066,426535869,3/21/2019,"Visiting Dublin? YOU MUST STAY HERE. Micheal and his wife are the most fabulous hosts. The airbnb is in THE BEST location. Right in the heart of Temple Bar area. Walking distance to all major attractions. It even has the best pick-up spots for public transportation. Which is fantastic if you have a late/early morning flight :). I cannot express how gracious they were as hosts. Provided tons of local tips, advice, and even printed our boarding passes for us! 12/10 would recommend every time!"
7781066,429549408,3/28/2019,Michaels place is perfect for visiting Dublin. The apartment is spacious with lots of natural light and is in a very central location. Michael was prompt in answering messages and provided many helpful tips about the surrounding area. Thank you so much Michael!!!

7781066,436173294,4/12/2019,Amazing location close to the Temple Bar area. We had some issues with noise on weekdays though. Bedroom and living spaces were nice. The bathroom is a bit more dated and the shower was not clean.

7781066,441861246,4/22/2019,Top apartment in an absolutely amazing location. Great host who responded quickly and gave some great tips and advice. Thank you again!
7781066,443222215,4/25/2019,"Located right on the pulse of so many different venues.  We walked to parks, shopping districts, historical sites, restaurants, Coffey shops and oh ya a pub or two.   The host was so very helpful and quick to respond to any issue or need."
7781066,445388881,4/29/2019,"Great location, far enough away from Temple Bar that there are fewer loud pub crawlers. We enjoyed the pub and Irish music at Darkey Kelly's."
7781066,450113447,5/8/2019,"Micheals place was exactly as described in the listing and as it appeared in the photos.  It was clean and roomy and nicely decorated, with plenty of extra personal care products on hand.  The location was very convenient to many Dublin sights, allowing us to walk most everywhere.  The only negative was that we were there over a bank holiday, and people drinking too much in Temple Bar occasionally woke us up at night as they stumbled home.  We knew this might be the case, based on prior reviews, so was something we could deal with.  Micheal was very helpful in providing guidance for our visit, and was an excellent communicator.  He went out of his way to help me troubleshoot international texting issues."
7781066,451950106,5/12/2019,Location and communication with host was fantastic however felt the apartment needed a good clean.
7781066,453284031,5/15/2019,"This flat is located in a perfect part of Dublin to explore every region that surrounds it.

The host was fantastic and everything was as described."
7781066,454472103,5/18/2019,"This apartment is ideal for using as a home base to explore Dublin. The apartment was clean, well thought out and felt like home. We absolutely loved going literally around the corner to the most amazing restaurant for breakfast each morning (Queen of Tarts) and strolling through the back streets of the city in leisure. Micheals wife met us promptly to let us in and show us the ins and outs. It is close enough to Temple Bar to be convenient, but far enough away to be a little quieter especially on the weekend night we were there. We highly recommend this home if you prefer the privacy of self catering over hotels."
7781066,455805014,5/20/2019,Micheals place is a wonderful spot to stay if you plan on exploring Dublin. You dont need to take a taxi or bus anywhere.

We loved his warm hospitality and he gave us a ton of helpful tips and recommendations on places to see and eat. We loved walking everywhere, even though we had rented a car, we left it in the parking garage for our time in Dublin. After walking and sightseeing all day, coming back to the apartment felt like coming home. The bed was the most comfortable bed we had on our trip to Ireland. We are so happy we stayed here and hope to someday come back! Thanks Micheal and Maylene!"
7781066,465125248,6/7/2019,"A wonderful location in the heart of the Temple Bar District, yet off on a cobblestone side street so there's no traffic noise while you sleep. Lovely look out the window to a beautiful, old church. Stylish touches. Cozy atmosphere!"

7781066,473203016,6/21/2019,"Michael and Maylienes apartment was the nicest of our tour of the UK and Ireland....spacious and clean and close to everything. My son and I were especially appreciative of Mayliene coming to personally save us and navigate us to the apartment when a cab dropped us off far away from where we were supposed to be. Lesson learned, like they suggest, take the 747 Airlink bus.... it was a much better (and more affordable) way to get to the airport.  Great space and experience all around."
7781066,475994847,6/25/2019,"Micheals place is so spacious, clean, the bed is so comfortable and it is super easy to get to from the airport. They also have two balconies, its so relaxing to sit there with my coffee. 
Micheal met us in person and give us a run down of the apartment. He is full of advice and local tips. His apartment is located on the quiet side of Temple Bar which is a big plus. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a place in Dublin."

Perfect location and really nice setup. 
Best AB&B I have stayed at so far!"
7781066,484088867,7/8/2019,"The Temple Bar apartment is perfectly centrally located, in walking distance to most of Dublins attractions. The living room/ kitchen in particular is a great space- bright and sunny with a nice balcony leading off. The apartment is very generously provisioned with coffee, tea, oil, herbs and spices, plus every possible detergent you could want. 
The street outside can be noisy at nightî light sleepers will notice it. The smoke alarm is sensitive- I set it off cooking without doing anything terribly dramatic- a roast chicken in the oven!"
7781066,485708261,7/11/2019,Micahels Place is fabulous- centrally located to everything ( next to temple bar on south side) and yet quiet. The communication with a Michael was terrific- he and his wife were at hand to check us in. He even reserved a parking spot for us. The place is quite spacious. We had a great time. We would recommend it to everyone-

7781066,498871041,7/30/2019,"This is the must stay location for anyone planning on spending a lot of time in Dublin. It was within 10-15 minutes walking distance of 90% of the things we had planned. It's on the fringe of Temple Bar district which is great because you are very close to all the bar and restaurants, but you don't hear the crowds and party-goers. They had outlet converters and a blow dryer. The shower has amazing water pressure! There is a great pizza place a block away called DiFontanes. My husband and I would get a few slices at the end of the night and take it back to the apartment. Yum!"
7781066,504800909,8/8/2019,"We had such a wonderful time in Dublin! The location of the apartment was perfect! So close to so many amazing bars/pubs, restaurants and historic sites. Our favorite place was Darkey Kelley's. Michael was a fantastic host! We got off on the wrong stop on the bus ride to the apartment, and he came to our rescue and found us out in the rain. He gave us many tips and suggestions on things to do and places to visit during our short stay. We wish we could've stayed longer! Will definitely visit Ireland again!"

7781066,514485222,8/21/2019,"Great host and very convenient location. Cleanliness is very good but the place could certainly use an update. Can be very loud at night, especially on weekends. Please note that the bed a queen size, not a king. Also washing machine, while convenient, took hours to do a load and doesnt really dry at all."

We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The apartment building was secure. There were shops and restaraunts in the alley and the fun but noisy pubs were just a short walk away.

7781066,527988051,9/12/2019,"Micheal and Marlenes apartment in Temple Bar is a gem. It is a corner unit and VERY well located. From the deck you can see a long way down Temple Bar and it appears as if you are surrounded by centuries of history everywhere, which you are!
The apartment is modern and airy and very well sourced with appliances , food and cooking items. Obviously our hosts take great pride in the accommodation and also the back up service and communication they provide. Could not recommend it more highly for visitors to Dublin."

They had snacks, candy, selection of teas and coffee, percolator, French press, everything you could need in a kitchen, etc. Body wash, shampoo and conditioner, toothpaste, hairdryer, etc. one of my favorite things was coming to the apartment every night to the super comfortable bed. How comfortable, more comfortable than my multi thousand dollar mattress. I havent slept so well in forever. I had to lift the covers to look at the tags and I was surprised and intend to buy it this week."

7806048,420948720,3/8/2019,Great location in Dublin! The Airbnb is just off a main street and across from a grocery store. Kitchen is well stocked. Joan was lovely and made our check in with her super easy! Thanks for a great stay!
7806048,421939603,3/10/2019,"We have enjoyed our stay. Joan is an accommodating host. The apartment is very clean, adequately equipped and had an optimal location for our needs."
7806048,424935397,3/17/2019,Great place centrally located within walking distance to many great places. The bakery on the street level was also fantastic and made the whole place smell fantastic. Dieters beware ;)
7806048,429951507,3/29/2019,Great value for the location. Parking is paid and across the street. Guinness Store House is around the corner. Overall would recommend and stay again! Thanks for having us.
7806048,435385188,4/10/2019,"Net appartement voor niet te veel geld. Twee complete badkamers erbij, douche is prima zit alleen weinig druk op de leidingen. Het inbegrepen ontbijt zijn drie kommen ontbijtgranen. Joan was erg soepel met in- en uitchecken. Woonkamer voldoet prima en is aan een binnenplaats. Slaapkamers aan de straatkant, bij dichte ramen heb je er geen last van maar is erg luid hij geopende ramen. Kortom prima verblijf (op 15min lopen van Temple bar) en fijne host!"
7806048,435785534,4/11/2019,Joans place is in a good location for walking around the city. It has shops on the same road and good bus links into the centre. The apartment itself is clean and tidy and both bedrooms are a good size. I would recommend Joans place!
7806048,437240232,4/14/2019,Joans apartment was very well located. It was a nice place to stay for the long weekend in Dublin. Joan was very nice and stayed late to accommodate my delayed check-in because my flight was significantly delayed. I would stay here again.
7806048,441891539,4/22/2019,Joans place is in an excellent location and she met us for check in and gave us the local tips. The appartment has all the things a traveler needs. My only criticism would be that some furniture could do with repair/replacement.
7806048,443094948,4/25/2019,Joan was kind enough to wait for us. We had communicated our plans but felt she was a little rude about us having a car and parking in Dublin. Place was a great location in Dublin
7806048,449326733,5/6/2019,"Great location, lovely clean spacious flat and helpful host !"
7806048,450114589,5/8/2019,"We checked in late (10:30pm) and Joan met us with no problem that night.  There is no parking, just public parking or on the street during a certain time. The unit has two bed rooms that were comfortable and two full bathrooms and a living area. No TV but Wifi and a large kitchen. Right below the unit is Dublin Cookie company- great for coffee or cookies in the morning. There is a Lidl just a short walk (2 mins) down the road for snacks, sandwiches, wine/drinks or whatever else you may need. We walked to Arthurs Pub for a great lunch and drinks. Also to Guinness (about a 10 min walk). I would not recommend walking around outside the unit late at night alone. The entrance door to the unit is in an alleyway that is dark..."
7806048,452523439,5/13/2019,"The first thing to note is there are a lot of stairs to climb, no elevator, so if you have limited mobility this is not the place for you. We enjoyed our stay in Joan's apartment. I loved that the living space is separate from the sleeping space. Being an early riser it is nice to enjoy some time away from the later risers. The beds and pillows are really comfortable. It is also nice to have 2 full bathrooms. The location is ideal for all sightseeing and public transit. Communication with Joan was always quick. As with most large cities, there is an issue with transients and drugs. Just be aware and all will be fine. I would not hesitate to stay at Joan's if in Dublin again."
7806048,453982111,5/17/2019,"The location is perfect - right in front of a bus stop and taxi stand, as well as walking distance to Christ Church and Guinness Storehouse. The place is clean and had great amenities, but the mattresses are not comfortable. On our last day, the power went out in the middle of the night and was out until the evening. We left earlier than planned as we were not able to have a hot shower, use wi-fi, or charge our devices. We also had to throw out food in the fridge. Our host was sympathetic but offered no compensation for our troubles."
7806048,454969614,5/19/2019,Great little flat in a good location. Exactly what we wanted for a weekend away in Dublin.
7806048,457955952,5/25/2019,Great location.  Be aware that there is no tv and you will have to climb stairs to the apartment.
7806048,461231792,5/31/2019,"Lovely apartment for a city break, super location for Guinness Storehouse. Very accommodating hosts with help when something left behind!"
7806048,462597158,6/2/2019,Joan's apartment is in a great location.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in Dublin.  It is a great size for 2 couples.  Check in was seamless.  I would recommend.
7806048,464729486,6/6/2019,Joan was very accommodating!
7806048,465272879,6/7/2019,"Good location. About a 15 minute walk to Heuston Station. Another 15-20 min walk to St. Stephens, Temple Bar, Grafton St, etc. Bus stop right out front and plenty of taxis around. Didn't find the neighborhood as bad as some reviews let on, nothing beyond what to expect when you're in a city.

OK amenities. Beds and chairs were uncomfortable but on par considering price point. 

Poor logistics. Listing indicates luggage dropoff allowed. I asked about this when booking and received no response. I asked again a couple weeks before our trip and I was told there was no space to dropoff luggage. Only accommodation offered was Joan would try to get us in as early as possible. Not a solution we could count on, we had to make other arrangements. Tipperary House near Heuston Station offers daily storage for 5 Euro a bag.

Finally, there was some issue with the WiFi. This did not affect us as we were traveling with a hotspot. However Joan gave a knock then walked right in on us while on the phone with I assume her provider in effort to fix. We were napping and showering after a long flight and made it clear the Wifi issue did not affect us. The walk in made for a good reminder to keep the door locked!"
7806048,469265737,6/14/2019,Nice place and great location!
7806048,470512382,6/16/2019,"The location was perfect, a nice steady 20 minute walk in to the temple bar area town, a stone's throw away from the Guinness factory & a short walk to the river. Plenty of supermarkets, bars, eating areas etc on every corner. The apartment was nice overall however, breakfast provided was advertised but it was clear that the cereal in the cupboard had been left by previous guests, there was no milk in the fridge or bread, butter etc so breakfast was not exactly provided. There was no toilet roll in either of the two bathrooms & we was not advised of this upon arrival of our stay. The bin in the kitchen had a lid that did not close leaving the whole kitchen smelly when there was waste food put in it."
7806048,472249589,6/19/2019,"Absolutely perfect apartment for our requirements. 15 mins walk from Temple Bar etc and an area full of true Dublin character and less touristy bars, we loved The Clock and had a great night drinking, chatting, and playing bingo with the locals. The apartment itself is wonderful stylish, spotless, spacious, and lots of little touches which shows the thoughtfulness of Joan (toiletries,phone leads,milk,hair dryer etc, iron) - wonderful all round !"
7806048,474615916,6/23/2019,Nice place pretty close to many areas of Dublin that are worth a visit. Enjoyed our stay.
7806048,478126403,6/29/2019,"Spacious flat with everything you need. Great location, plenty supermarkets and cafe/pubs round about. Less than 15 mins walk from Guinness Storehouse."
7806048,479594533,7/1/2019,We stayed in Joan's appartment to explore Dublin and start our trip around Ireland. The value for money is really good and the location is perfect for walking tours around the city.
7806048,480755314,7/3/2019,"Clean, simple apartment with just what we needed to enjoy 2 nights in Dublin. Location was great for walking down Temple Bar area etc. Bus lines right out front. Can be a bit noisy outside at night but thats to be expected. Appreciated Joans hospitality."
7806048,494003704,7/23/2019,Great location close to everything in Dublin!
7806048,500557260,8/2/2019,"Very nice, well kept apartment.  Great location and perfect walking distance to just about everything you need."
7806048,503057352,8/5/2019,"Joans place is spacious, clean and within walking distance to many sites.  Right down below is a great   coffee shop selling cookies and pastries, very convenient and delicious. There are also a couple grocery stores right across the street.  Would also highly recommend Arthurs pub just along in the next block and the Proof pizza restaurant in the same block.  Check in and check out was very convenient."
7806048,519396070,8/28/2019,The apartment is very bright and spacious. Very close to a bus and taxi stop. Close to the center and close to the Guinness Storehouse. Recommended for a visit to Dublin
7806048,521936404,9/1/2019,Close to Guinness Storehouse.
7806048,523752490,9/4/2019,"Perfect kitchen for preparing meals, excellent supermarket across the street. Very firm beds. Flat up two flights may be rough for older guests. Washing machine does not dry clothes..rack available."
7806048,534979254,9/23/2019,"The interior of Joans place was quite nice, particularly the shared living space. We were prepared based on reading previous reviews for the great deal of stairs to the unit and the limited free breakfastù which consisted of dry cereal but no milk. While the location was great to walk to the Guinness storehouse, temple bar area and many other attractions, the alleyway where the apartment is located has a clear issue of public urination. There were signs up to say urination in the alley is not permitted however during our brief two night stay we witnessed one man urinating right by the door we enter and the stench was almost unbearable while we waited for the host to greet us. If you can see past that and choose to stay here, I highly recommend Arthurs Jazz & Blues Pub. Great food, drinks and atmosphere just across the street!"
7806048,538108088,9/29/2019,"Overall a decently renovated place, nice kitchen, but one of the bathroom sinks was plugged, the mattresses had no support, so we had back pain every morning, and it was very noisy at night, street noise, men yelling, and strange noises from the building that we couldnt identify, made it hard to fall asleep. About a 15-20 minute walk to town centre, but the entrance to the apartment is in an alleyway, where we  would find men urinating every night we came home. Also the hot water did not last long enough for both of us to shower, and I usually only shower for about 5 minutes."
7806048,539828550,10/2/2019,"We enjoyed our trip to Dublin, Joans Place is a good location for seeing the city. Thank you"
7806048,540921581,10/4/2019,"Its a nice place to stay few days, clean, near from the Guinness Storehouse, the communication with Joan was good and fast during the whole process, I had a good experience I recommend it"
7806048,542190029,10/6/2019,"The apartment is clean, super nice and great located. Recommended!"
7806048,544498164,10/10/2019,Joan is a wonderful host. The apartment was lovely and perfect for us. It was super clean and cosy.  The location  was perfect as it meant that everywhere was a walking distance away. Myself and two of my friends stayed at the apartment for 3 nights and we were extremely pleased :) we loved the fact that there were 2 bathrooms as it saved us time when getting ready in the morning. We definitely recommend Joans apartment as we would like to stay there again if we visit Dublin again
7806048,557611027,11/1/2019,We stayed with our teenage daughter. The flat was really comfortable and there was plenty of space to cook and relax. The location is good - we walked in central Dublin.
7806048,558928066,11/3/2019,"Very Nice place in good neighborhood, you can reach the city center really quickly and eventhough the street is a bit loud, you can sleep well because of good windows."
7806048,561415596,11/9/2019,It is a nice place for family to stay.
7806048,567770595,11/23/2019,"This apartment is in the perfect location!  It is a few minutes walk from all of the major attractions in Dublin: the Guinness Storehouse, the River Liffey, St Patricks Cathedral, etc.  We did not have a rental car during our visit in Dublin, so the close location was great.  The apartment was clean and had a washer and wifi.  It was also very nice that the apartment had two bathrooms.  Joan was a lovely host and we recommend this apartment if you are travelling to Dublin!"
7807303,418113655,3/1/2019,"The location was absolutely perfect, we didnt have to take one bus or cab to do everything we wanted to do. 
The place is perfect if your main concern is location. The beds are a little bit uncomfortable, but everything was nice and clean and Joan was a great host. Slept four people just fine and the common area and washing machine were great to have."
7807303,420933453,3/8/2019,Good location and spacious amenities.
7807303,422871352,3/12/2019,"Very lovely space. Clean and comfortable. The apartment was walking distance from museums, the guiness store house and teelings whiskey distillery."
7807303,429237528,3/27/2019,Joan's place was perfectly placed for exploring Dublin with temple bar only being a short walk in one direction and the Guinness storehouse in the other. Joan gave us some great local tips including a lovely pub called Arthur's just a stones through from the apparent.
7807303,429861445,3/29/2019,Well organized and planned.  Great location and Joan is very accommodating.
7807303,430943622,3/31/2019,Perfect apartment for a weekend stay. As described and all functional although shower is no more than a dribble and pretty useless. Apart from that cant fault and we enjoyed our stay.
7807303,439153745,4/18/2019,"Great place, clean and comfortable apartment in central Dublin. Joan was very acoomodating and allowed us to check in early. Would definitely recommend!"
7807303,441868441,4/22/2019,"Joans place was nice and exactly as described. It was clean. It was comfortable for 4 women traveling together. The water pressure in the second shower wasnt good, but the water was hot and there was plenty of it. The only thing was the alley access stunk like pee, and it didnt feel super safe. We came and went together however and never had any issues."
7807303,445993235,4/30/2019,Apartment is in walking distance to all that Dublin has to offer. It was nice to have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms
7807303,449239766,5/6/2019,"Joans place worked very well for the four of usîtwo couples. It was very clean and comfortable, and having two bathrooms was definitely a bonus. It is within walking distance of the center of Dublin and the places we wanted to visit, and we found parking nearby on the street."
7807303,450732735,5/10/2019,"Great location, short walk to Guiness Brewery and Temple Bar. Good place for 2 couples. Nice host and easy communication, only complaint is that the beds are a bit stiff."
7807303,453200283,5/15/2019,"A nice clean apartment. It is in a good location, the apartment is spacious and has everything you need. Joan was nice, showed me around and was quick at responding which was a huge help as it was a last minute booking."
7807303,455201895,5/19/2019,Everything was fine. We will come back again!!

7807303,460496816,5/29/2019,Joan was very pleasant to deal with and responded to messages quickly. Great location and good recommendation to Arthurs pub. Would recommend.
7807303,461264578,5/31/2019,Very handy location and nice clean apartment. We really enjoyed our stay!
7807303,464792120,6/6/2019,Easy access to many tourist attractions. Comfortable beds; clean. Would stay there again.
7807303,468362022,6/12/2019,The location for this place is amazing!
7807303,470433168,6/16/2019,"Had a great stay at Joans apartment. Excellent location if you are wanting to visit the Guinness storehouse and Jameson factory and An easy 15/20 min walk into the temple bar area. 
Great base for a family or friends/couples for a long weekend. 

Pubs and restaurants nearby or you can cook in the apartment. 

Thanks for hosting us Joan we had a great time.

Georgia"
7807303,472718596,6/20/2019,Good location. Joan very responsive. Living room furniture could be better. Beds were nice
7807303,480205320,7/2/2019,A great place to stay in Dublin that is in a convenient  location  and handy to a Lidl supermarket. Accommodation is clean and comfortable  with plenty of amenities  and pleasing touches
7807303,481732195,7/5/2019,We loved staying at Joan¬¥s place. The place was exactly as pictured and described and she always gave us an immediate response on questions. Thanks a lot for the good time!
7807303,490957185,7/19/2019,"Great location for walking around Dublin. However the laneway seemed to be used as the local toilet for any man that walked past. Which made the front entrance stink. So was grateful for the rain to wash it all away.
Apart from that, the apartment was great. Clean, cosy and very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again if ever we went back to Dublin and will also recommend to anyone"
7807303,493882284,7/23/2019,Great location and nice layout. We did have some small issues with cleanliness (like a half drank water glass leftover from the previous guests on the night stand) but overall it was a good value.
7807303,520365159,8/30/2019,"Pros- the apartment is very well equipped.
Within walking distance to city centre.
Supermarket close by.
Joan is very responsive.

Cons- the area looks a bit seedy but we feel safe inside the apartment."
7807303,527697614,9/11/2019,Joans place is in a great location and she is extremely helpful. Her dinner recommendation at Arthurs was fantastic. The location of the Airbnb is great as well. Very close to the Guinness brewery and close to everything else. We walked everywhere.
7807303,530003641,9/15/2019,"A lovely two bedroom apartment close to most of Dublins attractions. There is a great kitchen and beds are comfortable. The wifi worked well and the apartment is near bakeries, pubs, grocery stores. The host responded to all our queries."
7807303,531426218,9/17/2019,Perfect location and sparkling clean. Thank you so much!
7807303,531799871,9/18/2019,A perfectly adequate place to stay in Dublin city centre. Communication was excellent and late check-in was kindly facilitated.
7807303,535370966,9/24/2019,"Good, solid AirBnB experience. An especially good location for an extended stay and for those comfortable learning how to use the local public transit system."
7807303,536688359,9/27/2019,"Good position, good value for money, good communication. Just a couple of things were not as expected: lack of hot water in one of the bathrooms and poor WiFi connection, that was essential for a business trip."
7807303,541568979,10/5/2019,Location is good. Not too loud even though it faces a main street. Bathroom can use more cleaning. Also one of the sinks took forever to drain.
7807303,543675224,10/8/2019,"I would have given 5 points if not for the poor plumbing in the apartment. Sadly, it seems to be an irish problem."
7807303,544991989,10/11/2019,"Joans place is in a pretty central location and has a great amount of space when travelling in a group! There are a fair few steps to the apartment to be aware of if you struggle with mobility but otherwise theyre not an issue at all! Nice to be near lots of pubs, restaurants and supermarkets so you can enjoy Dublin to its fullest :)"
7807303,546038291,10/13/2019,"Great location, the apartment is perfect for 2 couples. We loved the amenities and many things were very thoughful (coffe and cereal, shopping bags, adaptors from other countries, blow dryer...). Everything was just easy, thank you!"
7807303,548289716,10/17/2019,"This place was very affordable relative to other stays in the area, and we got what we paid for.  Having the two bathrooms was definitely a plus.  Check-in was efficient and the location was great.  I would recommend this place to travelers looking for a place to stash their bags and sleep, but not necessarily to relax at."
7807303,557963627,11/2/2019,Great place to stay in Dublin! It was so easy to get around the city and there were nice local pubs and restaurants as well! Joan was a great host and it was a nice place to stay.
7807303,565945014,11/18/2019,Joans place was a great place to stay at for a weekend.  Joan met us on arrival and the apartment was clean and tidy.  The apartment is roughly 15 minute walk from the centre of Dublin & so easy to get to everywhere of interest! Would be more than happy to stay here again when revisiting Dublin.
7814088,483194222,7/7/2019,"The kindest hosts, very thoughtful and go well out of their way to make sure you feel at home and know where everything is in their locality. Their house is beautiful, the perfect place to stay when wanting to visit Dublin."
7819035,426560049,3/21/2019,"Amazing location. Nearby food and culture. Walkable to quite a bit of what we did in the city. Needs some general upkeep done (ie floors need a deep cleaning, curtains are falling, mattress are worn out, etc) overall worth the stay."
7819035,429224668,3/27/2019,ok
7819035,434665731,4/8/2019,"Wow doesnt even come close. Beautiful apartment, amazing view and the area where the apartment is located is lovely. Would 100% recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin, thank you for an amazing stay! Hopefully will be back in the near future."
7819035,440204874,4/20/2019,"The location and flat were amazing and were sufficient for our large group of 9 ladies. It was more of a dormitory feeling with all the extra cots set up so we didn't spend a lot of time chilling/ relaxing there. That was our choice though as we wanted to stay there knowing it would be a bit cramped. It was also okay because we had tours and sightseeing to do and it was mainly a place for us to crash each night. It would be quite comfortable for a group of 4-6 adults though if you wanted to spend more time at the flat enjoying the view and a meal.
The view out the patio windows was incredible and we enjoyed it in the morning and evening. Also, we ate at restaurants downstairs and took advantage of the close grocery store across the street. The walk along the River Liffe to the center of town was a pleasant 25 minutes or so. We did laundry one night and we availed ourselves of the taxis always available right outside the door. 
The check-in and check out process were a bit clandestine in nature.  Two messages sent leading up to our stay were not acknowledged and info sent the day of our arrival was sent to a wrong number. 
But it all worked out in the end and we had a wonderful stay. Would stay again if in Dublin."
