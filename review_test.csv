Very good place to see city and the sea."
85156,A great alternative to an expensive Dublin hotel. Teresa is so friendly and it is truly lovely to come back to a suburban atmosphere when travelling. Simple transport options into Dublin City.

159889,About 25 minutes to City Centre by Bus 14 or Bus 16. Friendly guests and hosts. Good pubs in the area and a supermarket near. The Beaumont neighborhood where it is located is quiet and calm during the day and evening.

315698,"Absolutely amazing! The room is lovely and huge, and there is everything you need available, from a fridge to a balcony and comfy bed.  But the best part is Tracey, who is so hospitable!  She gave me tons of travel tips, and even some fruit to take along on a daytrip! She is a wonderful (Website hidden by Airbnb) like staying with a friend!  Great space, great host, and great value....You will love your stay!"

85156,"Accoglienza calorosissima! Teresa ci ha guidati prima ancora che chiedessimo informazioni. Casa molto pulita, persone gentilissime."
261248,Aircoach stop within 5 min from the house is a huge convenience. Good eating places within walking distance too.

261248,all good - enjoyed the stay
44077,All was wonderful. All the details were present and we had a really good stay in Ireland. The place is really calm and Teresa and her husband were really friendly with us at every moment
345398,"Alojamiento impecable. Algo alejado del centro pero hay tres buses directos con parada a 30 segundos de la casa(sin exagerar). Rachel muy amable, preocupada por tu estancia pero a la vez brindandote tu espacio personal y privacidad. 
Una bonita estancia."
162809,"Alojamiento muy limpio, Robbies es super atento y amable, el desayuno perfecto, seguro que volvemos alli. Gracias por todo."
237465,Amanda and Paul are very friendly and helpfull. It is a great place to stay when visiting Dublin. Close to the Airport and just 25min to the City center.
237465,Amanda was very friendly and very helpful. Got in touch with us a lot to make sure we had a pleasant stay. Would recommend 100%
237465,"Amanda's place is clean, inviting and you find everything you might need. If you require anything else, be it bicycles or a fresh set of towels, Amanda makes sure you get it and that you can feel at home."
237465,Amandas place is great! So private and cozy. Not that far from the bus stop and not too terribly far from the city center. I would LOVE to stay here again if possible. So many things are provided. I suggest going to the Aldi not that far away (or a different grocery store that was a bit closer-Lidl I think was the name) and cook a bit for yourselves rather than eat out. The kitchen was of great use to us.
237465,"Amandas place is very convenient if youre flying in and out of Dublin Airport.  It is a quiet place and a short drive to the heart of Dublin.  It was a great location to be for taking day trips all around Ireland.  The place was clean and quiet, good to cook meals in, easy to park a car, and  really affordable.  We would come back and stay again surely."
237465,"Amandas place was just what my son and I needed after traveling for over a week, it was great because you could cook there, do a laundry and a quiet place away from city.  I would stay again.  The 27a bus was quite convenient (a walk to stop)  , also the trip to Howeth was so easy from train and a beautiful spot.  We loved it. Thank you."
237465,"Amanda's place was perfect for my visit to Dublin! The space was a great size. There are 2 twin beds, a full bathroom, and a kitchen with stove and oven. The space is a 5 minute walk to the nearest bus stop which takes you straight in to Dublin city center. Amanda was fantastic with communication. She booked us a taxi for our 6am flight, and you can message her with any questions you may have. Overall, she was a fantastic host and I will definitely book with her again if I am back in Dublin!"
237465,Amandas place was so clean. It is adorable and cozy. Its about a 30 minute bus ride from city center but the bus stop is really close by. Amanda leaves a really helpful information packet in the room and is also great at responding to any questions. 10/10 would reccomend.
237465,Amanda's place was very clean and comfortable. The information pack provided is very helpful and her response to messages prompt. There is also easy access to public transit and a nice large park nearby. I would definitely stay again!
159889,Amazing hospitality! Will help you figure out local transportation! Overall amazing stay!
85156,"Amazing place to stay in a superb location, hosts are lovely. Would highly reccomend."
44077,"Amazing, warm, gracious hosts!"
292757,"An absolutely perfect and relaxing space for our last night in Ireland! Super comfortable beds, tons of movies to choose from, and everything else you could need. Sarah was a very helpful and accommodating host. We will be back for a longer stay!"
237465,"An amazing place have stayed a couple of times and love the place so much , and would recommended it to anyone"
162809,Another excellent stay in our Dublin home from home. Highly recommended.
162809,"Another excellent visit to Robbie's lovely apartment. Lovely welcome, comfortable bed and great hospitality."
266856,As ever a very warm welcome and great place to stay. Highly recommended!
178860,"As two parents  in need of a break, our weekend in Dublin and the house of Danielle and Fran√ßois was everything we hoped for: great hospitality, dito tips where-to-go and delicious crepes on sunday morning. And a spacious room with a very comfortable bed, only a stone's throw away from the lively heart of the city. We enjoyed ourselves, merci les deux for a lovely weekend!"
261248,Basic accommodation but reflected in price. Great hosts.
261248,"basic but good value for money , great location between 2 DART stations and local bus routes . Good location to explore the Dun Laoghaire area"
85156,Beautiful home and amazing hosts! I would definitely book with them again.
261248,"Bed was very comfortable, shower was hot, room was clean. BUT, room was freezing cold, even though we told them; could only get out of bed on one side bc room so small"
261248,Bit dated but ideal for my needs. Close to town and amenities and I felt safe walking in the area after dark. The room was fine and overall good value.
266856,bit older than expected.  nice light breakfast.  nice stay for a day.
85156,Both of our hosts were very helpful. It's very easy to get to the house from the airport and to Dublin. Great experience!
266856,"Brian and Phyllis are wonderful hosts, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  My son enjoyed talking to Phyllis about Zambia and loved his breakfast which was very filling.  Would definitely recommend them and cant wait to go back."
261248,Brian and Phyllis. Your home is warm and spotlessly clean. And the Dart is close by to get into central Dublin. I'll stay again.
261248,Brian And Phylliss is a great little Bed and Breakfast with in walking distance to a cute town.
261248,Brian and Phylliss place is great value and is a short walk to the commuter train into the centre of Dublin.
266856,Brian is a great host and his house it's so beautiful.
266856,Bring your own toiletries and hairdryer.
44077,"Churchtown,  aka dumdum is about 15-30 minutes from the city centre of Dublin depending on which public transit you take,  which is so easy to get to within minimum walking distance. Ms. Teresa's cottage is quaint and very comfortable. You feel like you belong there automatically. Spacious one room accommodation that is clean and super comfortable. Shared space in the kitchen and bathroom for now more than six total guests at a time. Their backyard garden is amazing and so great to sit, enjoy a cup of tea with fresh fruit or toast and jam that is provided daily. Muffins and cereals as well are usually on the menu. This was such a great time, I can't wait to go back!"
261248,Clean and great location!
178860,"Clean, comfortable, and great location in Dublin.  Danielle is thoughtful and welcoming. Perfect room with blackout shades for a good nights sleep!"
266856,"clean, cosy and quiet in good neighbourhood close to the see ! Great communication as well"
162809,"Clean, easy to find accommodation."
237465,"Clean, very responsive host.  Location was perfect as our trip was to visit family and was walking distance.  Very close to shops and buses for trips into city centre.  We would stay here again."
162809,"Clean, warm house. Robbie was a very thoughtful host who couldn't have done more for us."
237465,"Clean, well equipped, cca 20 minutes from city centre by taxi. Recommended!"
85156,"Comfortable accomodation, convenient for Dublin amenities. Lovely hosts."
345398,"Comfortable, friendly and located ideally for the purposes of my visit.  We will certainly try to stay with Rachel again on future visits to Dublin."
165828,"Comfy for no more than three. Beautifully appointed, nice area."
159889,Convenient distance between airport and town. They provide a simple breakfast which I appreciated as I could get started with my day straight away!
266654,Cosy and comfortable room. Joanne was very helpful and answered all my questions. The location is great as the bus stopping outside goes directly to the city centre. I would highly recommend staying with Joanne.
261248,Cosy place with breakfast included
85156,"Cosy, comfortable clean space. We had a lovely time, really appreciated local tips for restaurants and day trips (visiting Howth was great!)."
200979,Cute and fun
200979,Dalkey is my favorite village in Ireland... and Paul and Geraldine are my favorite hosts whenever I am in town.  Thank you both for being GREAT hosts !!!!!   I'll be back :)
178860,"Danielle and Francois are tremendously kind hosts. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was fabulous. Danielle was very quick to answer my questions before the trip and after the trip was great when I forgot something and had I come back and pick it up! Their home is the definition of Dublin quaintness - quirky with different levels and bright colors. The room was very comfortable. They also have the cutest cat! He gives pets out for free. As everyone else has said, the crepes are divine and they made sure I was able to have them even though it was unavailable on their typical Saturday morning crepe time. Would love to stay with them again."
178860,"Danielle and Francois are warm, well-travelled people. I enjoyed my privacy, while also feeling welcome. The space is beautiful. The bathroom fixtures and bathroom tile might be original; I have certainly never seen the like. The upper bedroom itself was quiet and spacious. It was no problem at all sharing the bathroom or making a cup of tea in the kitchen. The location is very good, and Danielle is responsive to all concerns or questions. A great experience."
178860,"Danielle and Francois were excellent hosts. They were so welcoming and accommodating, their place was beautiful and clean and had everything we could possibly need for a lovely break in Dublin. The pancakes were much enjoyed by us both and we would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Dublin. The location couldnt have been better, out of the way of hustle and noise yet easy walking distance to all the local attractions. Danielle and Francois were available when we needed them but gave us the privacy that we wanted whilst sharing their home. Leo the cat was a very welcomed addition. Thank you for having us, we will be back in the future."
178860,Danielle and Francois were very welcoming and friendly! Their home is beautiful and in a great location.
178860,"Danielle and Francoise are a beautiful couple and have a delicious house. We really felt like home at their premises: the house is beautiful, the room big and warm and the bed soft and comfortable. Francoise's crepes and Danielle's Tarots reading two of the best experiences in Doublin during the long weekend we spent there. They gave us good advices on restaurants and things to do and see in Dublin and surroundings. We will come back for sure!!!  We already miss Ireland and Danielle and Francoise!"
178860,"Danielle's place is centered in a lively and convenient area of Dublin - the location was central to many of the places I wanted to check out, while still allowing me to feel like a local. Her home is clean, quiet, and perfect for anyone traveling solo (I was). Danielle was so accommodating and gave me great suggestions/tips. Her husband and daughter are also lovely and very welcoming. Thank you for a great stay!"
178860,"Danielles place was just perfect for my first trip to Dublin.  The house is a charming Georgian with lots of character and located on a quiet street in the Portobello neighborhood - but within walking distance to the city center.  The room was much bigger than I expected, and the bed was very comfortable, indeed.  Most of all, I enjoyed the kind hospitality of Danielle and Francois.  And I highly recommend booking an extra day to stay with them to enjoy the delicious home-made crepes made special for guests just on Sunday :)"
178860,"Danielle's place was probably one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at! Danielle was very respondent to all my messages and was very understanding of my later than expected check-in. The house is very clean, and there are various teas and coffee to enjoy in the kitchen. She even gave me lots of local recommendations and really helped me enjoy my stay in Dublin! The crepes that Francois made were also really delicious!"
333950,Daragh and Edgar are really kind and welcoming. The house is lovely and in the city center of Dublin. Daragh gave us amazing recommandations when we arrived and was really friendly. The bedroom is confortable. Everything was perfect thank you !!
333950,"Daragh and Edgar were lovely hosts, they let us drop our bags off early, responded quickly to every message and question and provided helpful tips about where to go during our stay! The house was lovely, very friendly and welcoming hosts who put us at ease immediately and the house had all the amenities we could possibly require!"
333950,"Daragh and Edgar were superb hosts with excellent recommendations for what to do while in Dublin. My friend and I were only in town for two nights, but with Daragh and Edgars help we were able to make the most of it! The guest room is cozy, and the terrace is so lovely. You really cant beat being walking distance from everything! My friend and I used transit only once, and that was because of the rain, not the distance."
266856,Too bad to mention.
266856,Unfortunately we were not comfortable at this bed and breakfast. The pictures are misleading. The room is tiny. There is literally 6ù between the one side of the bed and the fireplace. The bathroom is tiny and is really a shower room. Without the picture of the bathroom you truly dont know what you are getting. I could not say that this is an Award winning bed and breakfastù. It is definitely not up to our standards and we are not 4 star people. You can book a nice hotel in Dublin for roughly the same cost. I would recommend that you do this instead of staying here.

3529607,"I would not recommend this place especially for the price she charges. The heater didnt work. It smelled like something died because water was sitting in the washer and smellled awful. I paid $133 for a place that I thought would be cozy but it was uncomfortable and to expensive for the tiny space. Isa is very sweet as a person so this has nothing to do with her as a person. Just, if you have to stay there and absolutely dont have any other option then maybe consider it. Just a fair warning though..."
497136,"The good
The place is located in a very nice and safe area. There is a grocery store 10 minutes away and a lot of restaurants (there is a burger place 10 minutes away, BuJo, that is superb!). 2 minutes away is the bus stop that takes you to downtown (its a 20 minutes ride, but the public transport is great and comfortable), and to my taste the neighborhood is way prettier than downtown Dublin. 
The room is very spacious, and the bed is very comfy. The main restroom is very pretty and you get a good shower.

The not so good.
You should be aware that it is possible, as it happened to me, that the three rooms in the house are rented to other travelers, and so that you are paying to stay in a guest house. The way the space is described, and some of the comments in the past reviews, made it seems as if Norah has one room to rent and that she and her family live in the same house. And so, someone like me, could want to rent the space to interact with the locals in their own home. My experience was as follows: 1. I do not know Norah at all (or any local living in the house). 2. The house has 3 rooms each one of which was rented to visitors. 3. From expecting to be hosted by locals, I soon realized that I was paying to be in a guest house (with zero interactions with locals and all the problems of sharing a house with people who do not own the house and dont care whether they have cleaned after themselves in the common areas.). 
In addition, there is no way for you to lock your door when you leave the house (and, as I say,  there are other travelers in the same house), and there is no safe to keep your valuables. 
There will be some milk, cereal, bread and coffee for breakfast, but depending on the other guests you might not want to use the kitchen if it is extremely dirty (the fridge had a horrible smell)."
6518542,"I would not recommend  stay in this place at all
1)	Bed and smelly mattress and bedset. I have been stayed in many Airbnb for last 3 years, I never had any problem with any of the place, but this place the bed set, matters is so old and smell horrible, I have to spent 80 Euro to buy a whole brand new bed set , so I can sleep. The mattress is supper old and smelly too. Everyday morning I have to leave the window open so I can stay  at night in the room .  

2)	Bad host behavior.  I was not be allowed to do laundry until after 11:00pm because Adam need to watch TV in the living room, he said it is very noise, but the water laundry is such a small one, the noise is not bad all, he just do not want to sacrifice even a little for his guest at all. The worst thing is that , he put his short in my laundry, next day in the morning I saw a man short in my laundry, I was pissed off and ask him why he did that , he denied what he did, so the short has leg and walked into the laundry itself?

3)	Unflushed toilet. Yes!!!!! Can you imaged that when you used the toilet in the morning, there some unflushed poop in the toilet and you saw it? That is f** so disgusting, it happened couple times, even tho on the day the day I checked out the place,  I saw it again, basically I lost my whole appetite  the whole day by seeing that, trust it , if you stay there ,you need to prepare for unflushed poop and the image will just hang in your mind all the time.  

4)	Horrible shower. It is impossible to take a good shower in this apt,  I have to go to gym everyday only for shower, feel free to stay here if you never shower 

5)	 the apartment is very old, which is fun, I paid $2000 for one month, I felt I definitely overpaid for a place like that for sure

6)	Lies. I asked Adam, how many people stay in the places, he said only himself, but turns out his girlfriend came to stay over all the time. Sometimes I have to wait for them to stop use the restroom so I can use the restroom, if I know there are 2 ppl stay there and I have to share the restroom with 2 other person I will never stay there. 

7)	Dirty Kitchen, if you want to use the kitchen to wash an apple, forget it, there are always dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and supper smelly with flies. 

8)	Noise from street, it is very close to the road, the noise is not too bad at night, but it will become really bad start early morning. I got woke up early in the morning by the car noise from the street, so I have to have a Nosie proof headset on, so I will not be woke up in the morning, which is very uncomfortable. 

All my Airbnb stay in last 3 years are all positive, this is my first time to give a negative review, because I have to speak out my mind this time , because it is such bizarre experience"
6219587,"This place is a nightmare. 
Carla was very suspicious of me because I was traveling alone and kept asking me to confirm how many were staying. One thing the listing doesnt mention is that you need to pay for your electricity (¬£5 a day per person) you must pay in Cash/ on your phone as you are checking in. 
While you pay for electricity, not all of the lights work, the power stopped working on the outlets because I plugged in the electric fireplace. After waiting 30 minutes I got a text back from Carla saying that I was not allowed to use that and I was in the wrong for trying to but this apartment is COLD. Im warning you right now, the pictures make it look better than it is. It is run down, uncomfortable, and over all for the $275 I paid for 3 days, not worth it in the least. I would have rather spent $25 more and stayed in a hostel. Its dirty, I had to sleep on the couch the first night because the sheets had hair in them and I had to hang them up to dry. 
The washer (works horribly and smells like mold) in the kitchen had old cloths in it from a previous guest (Im assuming) and the cooktop was very slow. 
Im warning you now, dont let the location get you because in this case, it is not location location locationù it is bad bad badù
Save yourself, you need to be highly intoxicated to get though a stay here. 
As the days went on, I noticed more and more things that were dirty and broken. I took pictures when I arrived because I dont trust that Carla will tell the truth when it comes to something being broken, based on how she was acting when I first arrived. 
This was a super upsetting stay. I recommend finding elsewhere."
6219587,"This house is very misrepresented. As I was looking for the hairdryer and iron I found drawers of junk, closets with luggage, plastic tubs full of stuff (clothes maybe?) The shelves are full of books, mail, knick knacks, an almost empty bottle of alcohol. I'm pretty sure someone lives here on a normal basis (which is fine, but I would like to be informed of that). Never found the iron, by the way, which I needed.  Had to pay ‚Ç¨5 a day for power, I was aware of that. But Carla made me worried I would run out of power. When I checked out the website to top up (just in case) I couldnt use it because I do not have an Irish phone number. So I lived in the dark for the first day worried I would run out of electricity.  I ended up figuring out how to check my electricity usage and by the 4th day as I was leaving I had 3 days worth of power left. (The website states that for a whole family ‚Ç¨25-28 a week would be average) So ‚Ç¨5 a day for a solo person that is touring the country is overkill.  So I paid for electricity for the rest of the week for whoever lives there. And if no one does live here,  the apartment needs to be cleared out of all unnecessary objects and half eaten food. 

Couch had a hole, chair seat was ripped, tile floor had huge chunk missing, coffee table was marred up, dishes all chipped, silverware bent beyond repair. Cords duct taped to walls. Dead flowers left on the coffee table. Half used bottle of tomato sauce and some ham in the fridge. Open corn flakes on the counter. Bathroom was decent, shower walls were funky though, stained grout had been painted over. No bathroom garbage can. Towels were like sandpaper. Bed was springy and uncomfortable.  Light fixtures hung down in front of doors and I was constantly worried about ripping the paper shades. Front door lock was a pain. Tv was basically useless,  only youtube, and you couldn't even use the search feature,  so I was stuck watching the popular videos that popped up.  Creepy phone on the wall that when picked up you could hear someones tv and living noises. I actually wanted to leave, but didnt want to pay for another room without a guarantee of getting my money back, so I just sucked it up and stayed. 

Location was pretty inaccurate. 5 mins to guiness, yes. But not 15 mins to trinity college, my Gps said 28 mins. Bad neighborhood.  Route home was dark and scary to walk at night."
6484506,"While we enjoyed the spaciousness of Peters place for our group of 6, the place was dirty - mouldy food left on counter, rotting flowers, empty dirty food wrappers in kids bedrooms, piles of things under the beds and generally just unclean. We also found the place to be lacking in the amenities we have found standard in other Airbnbs - phone chargers, blow dryers, laundry soap, etc. The area is a bit of a walk to shops, coffee etc but did feel very safe and quiet. Overall a 3/5 - large and safe but needs a good scrub and some little touches."

The mattress is supper old and smelly too. Everyday morning I have to leave the window open so I can stay  at night in the room .  

2)	Bad host behavior.  I was not be allowed to do laundry until after 11:00pm because Adam need to watch TV in the living room, he said it is very noise, but the water laundry is such a small one, the noise is not bad all, he just do not want to sacrifice even a little for his guest at all. The worst thing is that , he put his short in my laundry, next day in the morning I saw a man short in my laundry, I was pissed off and ask him why he did that , he denied what he did, so the short has leg and walked into the laundry itself?

3)	Unflushed toilet. Yes!!!!! Can you imaged that when you used the toilet in the morning, there some unflushed poop in the toilet and you saw it? That is f** so disgusting, it happened couple times, even tho on the day the day I checked out the place,  I saw it again, basically I lost my whole appetite  the whole day by seeing that, trust it , if you stay there ,you need to prepare for unflushed poop and the image will just hang in your mind all the time.  

4)	Horrible shower. It is impossible to take a good shower in this apt,  I have to go to gym everyday only for shower, feel free to stay here if you never shower 

5)	 the apartment is very old, which is fun, I paid $2000 for one month, I felt I definitely overpaid for a place like that for sure

6)	Lies. I asked Adam, how many people stay in the places, he said only himself, but turns out his girlfriend came to stay over all the time. Sometimes I have to wait for them to stop use the restroom so I can use the restroom, if I know there are 2 ppl stay there and I have to share the restroom with 2 other person I will never stay there. 

7)	Dirty Kitchen, if you want to use the kitchen to wash an apple, forget it, there are always dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and supper smelly with flies. 

8)	Noise from street, it is very close to the road, the noise is not too bad at night, but it will become really bad start early morning. I got woke up early in the morning by the car noise from the street, so I have to have a Nosie proof headset on, so I will not be woke up in the morning, which is very uncomfortable. 

All my Airbnb stay in last 3 years are all positive, this is my first time to give a negative review, because I have to speak out my mind this time , because it is such bizarre experience"
6782117,Dirty and a very noisy location.  May be OK for college kids but for a family I would not recommend this place at all.
7213049,Sadly the house was not as clean as we expect it. There were dirty sheets with some yellow spots and not enough towels. It looks a little chaotic to us.
7590197,"We are seasoned airbnb guests and this was, unfortunately, our worst experience. Luckily, the other airbnbs we stayed in for the remainder of our trip were fantastic and super clean.
Our friends said the pictures on airbnb reminded them of online dating - not showing accuracy of how tired the carpet and furniture looked. My first comment of the place was it reminded me of a frat house including the strong smell of marijuana when we got out of taxi.  Our friends said they didn't think the sheets had been washed properly because pillow cases smelled like women's perfume and sheets smelled like they had been in washer too long.  Towels were clean, but old.

We arrived after being up 24 hours from travel and there was one roll of toilet paper for 4 people in a 2 bathroom unit. 

When Micheal showed up at the unit the next day he was highly defensive,  arrogant and rude. He yelled, ""Get OUT!""  He could have handled it so much better by asking, ""Can you show me what is dirty?""  
His communication was generally quick, but the toilet paper and paper towels didn't show up until we were packed and ready to leave. We stayed less than 24 hours cutting our stay by 2 days. Finding a new place and moving our stuff took valuable vacation time away from the four of us. 
After we complained to airbnb, Micheal said his tenants on first floor complained of loud music. We are in our 60s,  we had been up 24 hours and never even turned the tv on.  Total fabrication.
It was conveniently located close enough to city centre. We walked 5-7 minutes to the Dublin Luas Black Horse station which was a few blocks from property.  
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

The distance to the train was accurate and that was helpful. We learned from locals and from researching crime in the area that Drimnagh isn't considered the best area and has had gang crime. You can research this yourself by using search term (Drimnagh Crime.) The impact was cabs wouldn't pick us up. We had 4 cabs cancel on us when they learned pickup address. The girl at the hotel told us she was afraid to park her car in Drimnagh for fear her tires would be stolen.
We knew going in that it was a moderately priced airbnb not upscale. Had it been clean, we would have stayed the entire time."
7749107,"Accommodation was still dirty, hairs were left in bedroom and bathroom. Bed linen had marks on already. A bit of a walk to the city centre"
449556,"(Zero stars not available) Doors to bedrooms share keys, so if you expect a secure stay don't stay here. We were woken up in the middle of the night by someone entering our room with a key!! We were startled awake at 12am and as a result we got NO sleep what so ever because we became fearful for our families safety.  We had an early morning flight so we wanted to get to sleep early.  However they do not turn on the hot water until 7pm and it does not get warm enough to take a shower until 8pm.  We had been traveling all day and got to the Hostel at around 4pm and could not get cleaned up until 8pm.  I call this place a hostel because that is all this is.  For the price you get uncomfortable beds, people screaming outside, no hot water until 8pm, and strangers unlocking your door at 12:30am. 
 We were in Ireland for 2 weeks and stayed at various locations across the country...this was by far the worst accommodation we've stayed in...in Ireland or anywhere else for that matter. The owner never responded to our emails about security issues. Honestly, pass this one up folks!"
3495749,"Isa is the worst host I've ever dealt with. She was unresponsive, didn't honor our agreement, gives out the wrong phone number that a guy named Jonathan answered and it apparently happens a lot because he tried giving out a different phone number for her that doesn't exist. She ruined my vacation to Ireland, WOULDN'T RECOMMEND!"
7749107,"It's an ok place to stay but we wouldn't book this accommodation again! 

There are certainly a few things that need updating in this flat. The worst bit for us was the shower situation - we specifically booked a place with two bathrooms and two working showers for a good reason... but we ended up with only one shower kind of working ( it had very weak water pressure, awful if you try to rinse off shampoo from long hair). We have been made aware of the broken second shower two days before arrival and let Joan know that this is very inconvenient for us. We received a small discount after contacting Airbnb with the  issue but would have preferred a working shower. Apparently she couldn't fix it as the apartment was fully booked for the whole week but one could have at least tried it since we only arrived in the evening - that made a minimum of 9 hours to get a plumber in.

Anyways, apart from that there have been a few other issues with the flat regarding cleanliness (spider webs on the ceilings, dusty) and a weird smell in the whole house (we couldn't figure out where it came from). The beds are very uncomfortable and there are multiple lose or broken appliances - one of the armchairs in the living room e.g. is broken and can't be used. Also, the flat in general is not soundproofed at all - bring some ear plugs for the night."
7749107,"Dublin is extremely expensive so other places are likely even more expensive. However, despite this apartment being newù, the furniture is obviously not. The beds are noisy, the handles on the doors fell off and the overall quality of the furnishings is low. No television and though the city is within walking distance, the neighborhood is not great."
3665546,"Unfortunately Sabrinas place did not work well for us.  We didnt have hot water 2 out of the 4 days we were their.  We would leave early and come back late and their must be some type of timer that turns off the water heater.  Despite following the instructions it never worked for us.  In addition the place needs a good thorough clean, it was very dusty.  Many of the amenities were rusted or had holes in them, kitchen items were dirty.  The walls are very thin, so if the neighbors are loud it can be disruptive.  The location is definitely the best thing about the apartment.  Checkin was also very easy.  If you want the best location and the other stuff doesnt bother you then it might work for you, for us it didnt."
261248,"Myself and sister were disappointed in our stay. We loved the location and the surrounding area was beautiful, however we found the room extremely dated and dusty. We also felt the room smelt very musty, forcing us to go and buy an air freshener. We slept poorly due to an uncomfortable bed, and noisy surroundings."
6219587,"This place is a nightmare. 
Carla was very suspicious of me because I was traveling alone and kept asking me to confirm how many were staying. One thing the listing doesnt mention is that you need to pay for your electricity (¬£5 a day per person) you must pay in Cash/ on your phone as you are checking in. 
While you pay for electricity, not all of the lights work, the power stopped working on the outlets because I plugged in the electric fireplace. After waiting 30 minutes I got a text back from Carla saying that I was not allowed to use that and I was in the wrong for trying to but this apartment is COLD. Im warning you right now, the pictures make it look better than it is. It is run down, uncomfortable, and over all for the $275 I paid for 3 days, not worth it in the least. I would have rather spent $25 more and stayed in a hostel. Its dirty, I had to sleep on the couch the first night because the sheets had hair in them and I had to hang them up to dry. 
The washer (works horribly and smells like mold) in the kitchen had old cloths in it from a previous guest (Im assuming) and the cooktop was very slow. 
Im warning you now, dont let the location get you because in this case, it is not location location locationù it is bad bad badù
Save yourself, you need to be highly intoxicated to get though a stay here. 
As the days went on, I noticed more and more things that were dirty and broken. I took pictures when I arrived because I dont trust that Carla will tell the truth when it comes to something being broken, based on how she was acting when I first arrived. 
This was a super upsetting stay. I recommend finding elsewhere."
3591840,"The apartment was very clean. However, the bathroom door did not close/lock. The beds were mattresses/box springs on the floor and were beyond uncomfortable. The springs in the mattress were broken, therefore, the bed wrapped around you like a cocoon. The neighbor cooked something nasty 24/7 and the smell leaked into the apartment. The fold out beds in the front room have stained mattresses. The washer appears to be only hooked up to hot water so our clothes shrunk. There was 3 of us staying at the Airbnb for 3 nights and only 3 towels were available. I actually contemplated finding a hotel but due to the marathon and festivals, they were booked and expensive."
266856,Too bad to mention.
451611,"Unfortunately, I was not happy with my experience in Daraghs apartment. After reading this review, you may very well decide that the things that disappointed me about the apartment are not the kinds of things that would bother you. But personally, I would not rent this apartment again. And Im sorry and sad to have to state that. With that mentioned, there certainly are a lot of positives about this apartment. The location is pretty wonderful. Its so close to the city center, and there are plenty of great restaurants, and shops, and just about anything you would need or want within just a few blocks. The proximity to St. Patricks Cathedral right across the street, and viewable from the apartment windows and balcony, is super charming and kind of romantic. The cathedrals park and gardens across the street are really beautiful. In good weather (hey, it can and does happen in Dublin!), its a great place to sit and people watch and take a little break from your hectic travel schedule. The park flowers are gorgeous. Super location. Daragh is a very nice guy. If there is something/anything he can do to help you, he certainly will. Hes eager to make thoughtful suggestions, and hes a very congenial host. His restaurant suggestions are especially excellent. However, I found the apartment to be in poor shape in terms of being worn, and in terms of a serious brown and black mold problem in the bathroom within the grout throughout the shower/bath area. I shared all of this with Daragh after my stay, as none of the worn or mold problems could have been remedied during my stay. They all require a period of maintenance when the apartment isnt in use, otherwise Im sure Daragh would have tried to help. I found the laminate flooring to be very worn and in serious need of replacing. I understand from Daragh that the apartment is scheduled to be painted in early June, and thats great because it really does need it. The doors are very scuffed and worn. There are black water stains on the wooden countertops around the kitchen sink that looks really bad. Ive stayed in more than 18 different apartment rentals in Europe and the US, and Ive never come across an apartment in this kind of worn condition. It was especially surprising and disappointing given so many positive reviews. I can only guess that the kinds of things that Ive mentioned here that disappointed me are the kinds of things that simply didnt bother the people who wrote those reviews. Everyone is different and has a different personal perspective. I get that. Ive been very honest about everything Ive mentioned here, and I hope it will help you in making your own decision about the apartment you ultimately decide to rent in awesome Dublin. And it certainly is awesome. I also hope my review will encourage Daragh to continue making improvements to the apartment. Best of luck to you on your upcoming vacation!"
742656,"Daragh and his girlfriend are very nice. Although, we did not quite enjoy our stay. Our ""bed"" cannot be called a bed anymore. The mattress is so bad I cannot even describe. Haven't slept so badly in years. You literally feel every single spring. Two nights there felt like nightmare.
Also, we didn't expect to be 6 people using the same bathroom. We knew that we will have a shared bath, but it was not only Daragh using the shower/ toilet but also his girlfriend and another couple he rent a room at the same time. Being upstairs you need to be very lucky to get an empty spot, otherwise you're walking down to the toilet/ shower and back to the room several times before you can use it..."
3374950,"Budget accommodation, unreliable communication with host, place looks not  maintained from outside, very bad smell by the front door. Kitchen is not functional, uncomfortable bed, all of this would  have been ok IF...  we has been able to sleep !  First night loud music until very late, 2nd night a  20 min dog barking session around 4am. It does appear that we were overcharged as well.  Did not use the kitchen at all ! So disappointed !"
3552721,We had a really bad time with Lina... but thanks to Airbnb we could leave the place and find something better. Thanks to the costumer service from Airbnb ‚ô•Ô∏è we would never ever recommend Lina.
3665546,"The apartment not clean 
The apartment not enough for 3 person 
Bad smell in the apartment"
4470132,"I writing this as an experienced host and traveller. I booked a room for 2 nights, drove from wexford to visit my sick mother in hospital, locked myself out of my room on the second morning, I had to go upstairs where the landlord Bernard lives and ask for spare key, he seemed very agitated, he unlocked and barged in, walking around, he spotted my dog lying on the couch trow over, and lost the head, using bad language and aggression. No way could I stay another night,. Its a tiny bed sit which is way over priced, no radio TV, no room to swing a cat,no double lock, didn't feel safe leaving belonging there. Cracked door, where it had ovbiously been kicked in. Hot water only lasted 5 mins after an hour wait . I told him if he had a problem with pets just don't advertise, to which he hung up the phone after more cursing.  I'm not one for confrontation, but there was no talking to this man. Enter at your own risk."
4470132,Unfortunately the apartment did not live up to our expectations and the host did not respond to our queries once we had arrived.
4470132,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5095083,"My husband and I were very unimpressed by this rental. We arrived around 6pm and had an awful time finding our way to the room. Luckily there was a nice gal who lived in the building and she helped us find our way. If it wasnt for her, we would have never found it. Our key was left in a mailbox that was completely open and anyone could have grabbed it. I cant stress enough how UNSAFE this building is.. as a woman, I could never imagine coming here alone. Also, as we were walking in there was someone going the the restroom right outside the entrance. So that made sense why it smelt like urine everywhere. The building is absolutely disgusting. Once we finally found the room, we were welcomed by an awful smell in the hallway and the entire hallway was filled with toys and equipment, they must have been a neighbors but nonetheless,  it didnt leave much room for walking. Once we got into the SHARED apartment, there was stuff everywhere. The kitchen had probably 20 alcohol bottles out on the counter and the whole place just looked a wreck. After being in the apartment for all of two minutes we knew there was no way we could stay here. We ended up booking a hotel for two nights, that was not cheap but there was no price tag we could put on it. Save yourself the time and I would never even consider this place. I have never written and bad review on Airbnb, and we dont feel like we are picky travelers but we felt it was necessary to warn anyone that is considering staying here."
449556,We were disappointed with our stay.   The place isnt inviting to say the least. Its very basic and bare bones. A question of cleanliness.  Not for a family.

449556,"Basic accommodations, one notch above a hostel and therefore over priced. Compared to the 4 other Airbnb we stayed at in Ireland it  was disappointing."
649740,"Initially, we were very excited to stay at Daves place as he gave a long explanations of meet up, check in and things to do in the city. It seemed to be a great deal, location and host but when we got to Dublin that was not the case. We had agreed on meeting at a location not at the Airbnb and the plan was for me to message him when we arrived at the airport so we could plan the timing accordingly. Our plane was slightly late but I messaged him as discussed when we landed. I also messaged him when we got on the bus and were headed towards the meeting location. Then again when at said location. This was over a span of two hours without a response. We continued to wait another hour but he never responded. We had a snack at a cafe next door waiting for a response and still nothing. We ended up having to cancel the reservation since we had all of our luggage with us and wanted to make sure we could find a place for the night. It was very disappointing and upsetting that there was no communication so last minute causing us to lose money and a place to stay."
649740,Im very disappointed in this Airbnb. We went without water for over half of a day and the person assisting us didnt respond for 8 hours.  I wouldnt stay here again unless the host actually stayed in town for the next stay.
692956,"After reading many of Jim's good reviews, I was entirely disappointed in my experience at his unit. Jim provided a deceptive and untrue description of the unit. Remarks that he will not enter unit unless proper notice is given; instead comes inside, unannounced to drop off ""shampoo"", contacting me after the fact. This is 100%, unacceptable and an invasion of privacy. What if I was in the shower or sleeping? Unacceptable invasion of privacy. 
Boiler is on a timer, and unit was freezing cold 24/7. Small, ancient, unsafe space heater could not be left on due to fear of fire or electrical hazard. Unbelievable that in the cold, Irish winter, Jim would not allow the inadequate heater to run sufficiently. Description stated that Jim is flexible with check-in, however,  after contacting him, he showed no flexibility whatsoever. Linens and towels were stained and did not seem sanitary. Washer & Dryer are on a remote timer, Jim tries to force the occupant to pay extra to wash clothes when the equipment is already there and available to use. WIFI coverage was borderline unusable on my mobile, with constant drops and disconnections. The only useable connection would be if I held my mobile by a window. A WIFI repeater is needed to maintain a good connection in the unit. Jim's frugality has severe repercussions on the unit's viability."
1073487,"For at least two people living under the same roof and only one bathroom for all people it should be not allowed to host strangers. No privacy!! Walls are so thin that any noise is heard in the entire home. Attitude of host is more than annoying. Issues with cleaning, everywhere in the home there are flying hairs of the 2 cats and 2 dogs running around. Disappointed as the price paid was very high compared to what you get...."
1332458,"We stayed in this property at the beginning of July for 3 nights to celebrate an upcoming wedding.  This property should be avoided at all costs,  if you are expecting it to look anything like the photos you will be greatly disappointed.
Every part of the property has issues which are not just down to the age of the property and a need of paint as the host would have you believe.
The property has many health and safety issues starting with the stench as you enter the building.  This come from the damp, mould and mildew that is evident on every floor.  The stench is a mixture of damp, mould and filth and permeates to every floor.  We had to buy scented candles to try and mask the stench.   During our stay the few windows that could be opened led to a plague of flies entering the property, they came from the garden area that could not be accessed.
Other safety issues are the electrics, there are broken sockets and light fittings and dubious wiring. There are broken floorboards, unsafe bannisters, raised threshold with raised screws.  Wall coverings are held together with masking tape and plaster to the walls with baton.  
The property looks like it should be condemned and locals told us it was supposed to be.  No one in the local area could believe it was being rented through Airbnb and they warned us to keep our bags and belongings with us as we were not safe.
We were a group of 14 women of various ages and not one of us had ever experienced staying in such squalor.
The property made our trip memorable for all the wrong reasons."
7290341,Location is good. Disappointed about a couple of bits like the dishwasher but really handy for a night in Dublin.
7290341,We were disappointed by our stay at Jerrys place unfortunately. The apartment was conveniently located and check in was smooth enough. However we found the apartment was grubby and damp smelling and had no river view as suggested by the photos. The towels provided were damp. The beds were fairly comfortable. It was fine for a 1 night stay but I would not like to stay longer and would not stay again as I believe there are better options available.
1332458,"We stayed at this property for a hen weekend in July. I have stayed in many airbnbs over the years and have only had positive things to say about my experiences. But I cannot find anything good to say about this house. 
As per the description of this property we were expecting the house to be a little rough around the edges due to its age but what we found at the property was far from a few rough edges. Every part of this property had issues. Starting with the smell as you enter the building. It was clear that none of the beds had been changed with some of the bedding noticeably dirty and covered in hair. Immediately on our arrival we had to find clean bedding and change them ourselves. There were flies throughout the house, the bathrooms were visibly dirty, the showers had grime around the tray and the carpets didnt appear to have been hoovered for some time. This is not what we had expected, not least considering the exorbitant cleaning fees. 
In addition, there were multiple health and safety issues on this property. The windows had to be propped open with sticks of wood to keep them up, and when we did manage to open them, they were dirty and falling apart from the damp. Other safety issues, noticed and pointed out to us by the fire service were the electrics, including broken sockets and light fittings and unsafe wiring. The fire service were shocked at the number of safety issues in the property, nor could they believe that the property was being rented out as an Airbnb.
There were broken floorboards, unsafe bannisters and exposed screws. There was little thought to fire safety; over the four floors, there was just one fire escape through the main entrance with the second door to the back garden bolted shut.
On the second night of our stay, a water pipe burst in the kitchen and we were forced to evacuate by the fire service when we were informed the house was unsafe to stay in. We were told that the key issue was not the flooding from the burst waterpipe but the state of the electrics in the property that made the flooding so dangerous. If we had realised the extent of the health and safety issues at this property, we would not have booked. 
We were a group of 16 ladies of various ages, two of which are pregnant. We had nowhere to go on Saturday. We had to walk half an hour to a 24-hour McDonalds as this was the only place open and we were informed the safest place for us to go. We decided to travel to the airport at 3am and were stuck there for hours with no sleep. Nicole offered us no support during this ordeal, and only questioned why we had phoned the fire service!
Staying here ruined the entire weekend and the stress and risk this stay put us all in was completely unacceptable. We are currently pursuing a full refund for this stay and would warn anyone thinking about booking here to AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

6657775,"This Host cancelled my reservation on night my Stay!
Maria had decided that I was not the man in my profile Picture (it was me!, a picture 5 years old and few lbs extra)  and she stubbornly refused me access to the place.
Maria seriously underestimates how stressful this is for a client. That night in Dublin, there was multiple events in City and it was next to impossible find another place or Hotel.
While AirBnB were trying their best to find a suitable replacement ... it took hours. Four and a half hours in fact.
I have used AirBnB multiple times across Ireland and Europe, and have never experienced this behaviour. I have always got very positive reviews from everyone I stayed with, and I had also presented Maria my Passport/Driving Licence/Credit Card ... But, She still refused me access to place. As ""I was not the person in Photo""???. 
She even had the vulgarity to say ""The Person in the Photo looks Healthy"".
After 4 and a half stressful hours, AirBnB managed to finally find me a replacement accommodation, and this ""unhealthy"" person did manage to run the Dublin half Marathon :)

Unless you want stress and drama ... avoid this host!"
1332458,"Nicole was a great hostess and provided detailed and timely communication. The house is well located and in easy access to much of Dublin. However, I must be honest in my overall review. Upon reading the description of the house, I was intrigued at the notion of a historic home and didnt blink an eye when learning about it being restored. It did not bother me that it was imperfect and that the layout included three flights of stairs, an unconventional bathroom, and multiple beds in one or more rooms. I was prepared and excited for quirky. I was not prepared for the condition of the home in terms of smell, paint, floor coverings, and carpet. While we were there, the entry and stairwell leading to the second floor had such a strong odor that we had to contact Nicole. It smelled horribly of mildew and decay. She came to clean, but the smell returned by the next morning. There was physical evidence of rodents in the home, and the smell of mildew wore on many of the nine of us in the home. The conditions of the walls were in need of repair. The carpet leading up the stairs was very, very unclean. The unconventional bathroom layout did cause some stress in terms of working around 9 guests and their bathroom needs. This house has great potential. It will be great one day. But, in the meantime, its important for future guests to truly understand that the underlying issues are more than just cosmetic. The environmental issues with mold, dust, decay, and so forth are definitely unhealthy and of concern."
4195273,"For our first trip to Ireland, we 3 ladies from the U.S. saw Conors Bright and Spacious Apartment and Back Yard as a welcoming, sparkling & cozy accommodation. What we found when we entered was the FARTHEST from that.  The apartment was cold, dark and filthy with live spiders in the kitchen and cobwebs on the exposed drawer of silverware. The toaster was grimy and had not been cleaned in a very long time. The picture of the brown leather leather sofa with the orange pillows, we thought, was the pull out sofa. When we removed the cushions, flying bugs came out and there was dirt, cobwebs and crumbs.  There was NO hot water to wash our hands nor instructions how to turn it on.  We ended up starting the shower for some warm water.  Some one elses used soap and toiletries were in the shower. We went outside to the back deck and my sister stepped on a piece of rotten wood and fell through, twisting her ankle.  There is not a little white table and two chairs on the deck as the Conors pictures show.  The back yard was full of twigs and leaves, as was the trampoline and hammock.  The BBQ promised to be available for use was full of spiderwebs and had NO propane.  Hanging on the clothesline by the BBQ were sheets and towels, I imagine from the previous guest.  In the apartment, the only place to hang clothes is in an armoire.  It had 8 hangers, three of which were child size.  The clothes rack under the stairs had many coats and childrens clothes taking up space. The pots and pans on the stove and microwave are stored there because there is no room in the cabinets under the counters.  They are full of cleaning supplies. The walls and floors were mucky and unclean.  All in all,  a very unsanitary, unsafe and uninhabitable apartment.  We were and are highly disappointed to the extent we could not stay in those conditions.

When Conor greeted us, we expressed our concerns. We showed him the sofa, the kitchen and the back yard pointing out the rotted piece of decking that my sister stepped on.  Conor discounted everything we said and he NEVER apologized for any of it. Regarding the deck, he said Well, sometimes you have to replace a piece of wood, like I did over there.ù (pointing to a board that was newly replaced). Regarding the uncleanliness, Conor offered to clean the place while we waited. Conor said the person who watches his children did the cleaning for him this time because he was out of town. Conor told us Good cleaning people are hard to find in Dublin, thats why I do it myselfù.  The brown sofa was not the sleeper he stated.  The blue one was but when we pulled out the seat and back cushions, the was hard wood underneath.  The description says it is suitable for 4 guests. Maybe two adults and two very small children, certainly NOT 3 or 4 adults. There were only 2 sets of linens set out even though Conor knew there were 3 of us arriving.  We could not find another set of towels. Regarding the hot water situation, Conor told us there was a timer under the cabinets by the sink that controls the hot water.  There were no instructions in the manual about turning on the timer or how to activate the hot water, only instructions about the shower.

We told Conor that we just could not stay in these conditions and that we were going to a hotel.  It happened to be Pride weekend in Dublin and there were thousands of people in town. I said to Conor,  Since we are not staying, you can rent it out easily with as many people that have converged onto Dublin.  You wont have a problem.ù  Conors response to me and my guests was,  I cannot cancel the reservation and rent it again because that will affect my SUPER HOST STATUS and I will lose that distinction.ù  We all looked at him in disbelief. I asked him what sort of compensation he could provide since we were not staying and he only offered the cleaning deposit returned.  He said, Many people love this place, thats why I am a Super host.ù  Conor never once apologized, acknowledged our concerns or asked how my sisters ankle was.  Being more concerned with his status rather than the comfort of his guests does not make one a super host. I am appalled and dismayed at Conors lack of respect and integrity.  If this is the experience Conor wants to provide to first time guests to Ireland, I would never come back.  Thank goodness we ended up in a nice hotel for the final part of our vacation."
4319495,"Unfortunately, and strangely (given the other reviews), our stay was definitely not as we expected. In our case, specifically, the room was not clean. We imagine that other stays have been much more ideal, however our room was unclean bordering on unhygienic - it was definitely uncleaned, or poorly cleaned, after the previous guests. After good communication prior to our stay, the communication regarding some issues that required resolving was poorer. The room was cleaned adequately, but other issues were eventually ignored. The lock on the room was broken, there were some wires exposed on the ceiling of the bathroom, and the pipe under the sink was leaking creating a little puddle under the sink. This, it was communicated, would be fixed, but none were. It seemed clear to us that the hosts simply didn't have time for the maintenance required with hosting an AirBnb accommodation. Furthermore, and this was our experience, they therefore definitely didn't have the time to create the coziness advertised - we didn't feel welcome to use any of the shared spaces, mainly because the other people living in the house barely looked up to say hello, definitely not up for a chat or offering any advice (as also advertised). After all, this is an AirBnb that we are paying to stay in, not a favour that is being done for us - and we certainly felt like we were a nuisance in this space. We spent quite a bit of time contacting the hosts and Airbnb support during this stay, and it definitely tainted our trip.

This is our first negative experience with AirBnb, and we are disappointed with how the hosts dealt with this after us raising our concerns after the stay. We have not received any communication since the second day of 4 (nights) of our stay.

Besides this, the location has a good connection to the city, and our bed was comfortable. It was one of the more affordable rooms we found, and if none of these issues existed it would definitely have been good value for money."
6484506,"While we enjoyed the spaciousness of Peters place for our group of 6, the place was dirty - mouldy food left on counter, rotting flowers, empty dirty food wrappers in kids bedrooms, piles of things under the beds and generally just unclean. We also found the place to be lacking in the amenities we have found standard in other Airbnbs - phone chargers, blow dryers, laundry soap, etc. The area is a bit of a walk to shops, coffee etc but did feel very safe and quiet. Overall a 3/5 - large and safe but needs a good scrub and some little touches."
3374950,"I feel as if you're renting an Airbnb its an extension of your home. I truly hope this host home is cleaner. This place is filthy. Too much detail to go into lets just say the ENTIRE place needs to be cleared out and scrubbed like its never been scrubbed before.  Walking barefoot just long enough to realize I needed to put shoes on ASAP. Never been mopped and rarely swept is my guess. I large collection of partially used personally product are left behind in the bathroom. Cabinets are full of opened food packages. 6 bottles of olive oil?  I get the impression someone lives here when not rented, which is ok. But you need to do more than just change the sheets when a guest is coming. it looked as the sheets were changed? It's listed as a 2 bed unit. When we arrived there was only 1 towel and ZERO toilet paper. Only one bed had sheets. I messaged  Fionnuala about more towels she stated that she didn't know how many people were coming? Two of us on the reservation, lets go with two.  Lights hanging from the ceiling, paint falling off. I paid $126.00 USD to stay one night. It's not worth $1.26 USD. Its all very unfortunate. This place could be great place is only host took a slight bit of pride in her rental. Fionnuala seems like a nice person. And was respectful of our privacy, but she need to spend a day scrubbing this place top to bottom.  I can't recommend this Airbnb. The only good thing about this place was the wifi speed."
5893921,"If youre thinking of staying at Malcolms apartment in Customs House Harbour make sure he had attended to - water that wont go down the bathroom sink and shower, the faulty room heaters, the cupboard with only half a hinge, the shower handle hanging by one dodgy screw, the filthy cooking utensils, the moth-eaten and tatty towels, the weeds on the balcony, the filthy glass on the balcony doors, the filthy oven, the dirty  and damp linen of previous renters in the cupboards and make sure the cupboards are free from clothes of previous renters. If he can guarantee those things, then the location is good. And be careful not to pay too much for what you get and dont take Malcolms word that he will deliver what he promises."
6719721,"AWFUL!  BEWARE!  My husband and I walked in, looked at each other and walked out (that's how bad it was).  We were fortunate that we were able to find a room at a hotel that evening.  After all, we were in Dublin, on St. Patrick's Day!!  My husband and I planned a trip to Ireland and had a layover in Dublin, coincidentally on St. Patrick's day.  All hotels were booked, so I took to Airbnb.  I found Christian's listing and reluctantly booked.  I read prior reviews, and in fairness, all were not great but come to find out TRUE! The walls, floors and windows were filthy, the bed felt like a concrete slab and it had a felt like we were in a youth hostel which is fine but not for the price we were paying.   All that aside, Christian  quadrupled the price because it was St. Patrick's Day.....not cool, not kind!  When I reached out to Christian he was non-apologetic and condescending. I reached out to Airbnb and had little success because I did not take photos (lesson learned).    Safe travels..."
6914056,Good location.  Very sad situation in the suite with a large rabbit in a very small and filthy cage - depressing - left alone and trapped in this small cage in the middle of the living space.  Safe yourself a bunch of euros and stay in a hostel - same type of set up!
6972110,"Stay clear of this place.  The photo is not what it actually is.  If you have no problems with filthy floors, carpet, furniture and extremely questionable, old sheets and towels, this is your Dublin city-center dump.  (I have never written a review like this.)"
3858756,"Although this was a nice apartment in a central location, we had no hot water for two of our four days (first and last).  Owner quickly fixed the water heater the first day and the next two days were fine. Then on our last night and morning, we had no hot water (none). Upon review of other renters reviews, I now see this is an ongoing problem. Renter beware. 
Owner did not reply to my check out message/complaint although she was responsive prior to that. 
Great location. Secure building with elevator (3rd floor apartment). Washer/dryer in unit."
6494825,"Pros:
1. Excellent location in the heart of the old city. 
2. Responsive nice host.
3. Minimal noise in bedroom.
4. Toys for kids.
5. Great grocery store across the street.
6. Bunk beds in master.

Cons:
1. Not very clean. It was surface level cleaned but inside drawers, walls, washer, beds, etc it was  dirty and unkept. Beware of you open drawers.
2. Flies get in whenever open windows. It needs window screens. It was impossible to get ventilation without flies getting in. 
3. Master also has zero ventilation outside a door that leads to fire stairs and loud vents which limits the poss of opening at night.
4.. Limited hot water in shower. It was only warm enough for 5 minutes or so shower then gets cold and you will have to wait another 20-30 minutes  for it to heat up again. Remember to turn on the switch ahead of time. 
5. Large cell phone tower across the way a street or two away which was a big safety concern for us. This of course is of no fault of the owner. There is plenty of research that proves negative health impacts of distance to cell towers. Would have not rented it if wr had known ahead of time. I would be most concerned for children who ate most suceptible and adults who have health issues. 
6. Building needs to be kept up. There were dirty towels left outside the main door. While it's an old building with charm it felt very seedy and we questioned whether we made a mistake from the moment we arrived.

All in all the unit has tremendous potential to be lovely unit if it is kept up, deep cleaned after all guests and better organized."
6518542,"Pictures are not accurate- lot of stuff in shared space, no lock on bedroom door, both bedroom & bathroom were very dirty (i.e. found a womans hair accessory in the bed that was not mine, lot of mold in bathroom- beware of allergies). However, Adam was very nice & accommodating with check-in & communication."
449556,"Lovely location, but awful host"
3529607,"I would not recommend this place especially for the price she charges. The heater didnt work. It smelled like something died because water was sitting in the washer and smellled awful. I paid $133 for a place that I thought would be cozy but it was uncomfortable and to expensive for the tiny space. Isa is very sweet as a person so this has nothing to do with her as a person. Just, if you have to stay there and absolutely dont have any other option then maybe consider it. Just a fair warning though..."
5095083,"My husband and I were very unimpressed by this rental. We arrived around 6pm and had an awful time finding our way to the room. Luckily there was a nice gal who lived in the building and she helped us find our way. If it wasnt for her, we would have never found it. Our key was left in a mailbox that was completely open and anyone could have grabbed it. I cant stress enough how UNSAFE this building is.. as a woman, I could never imagine coming here alone. Also, as we were walking in there was someone going the the restroom right outside the entrance. So that made sense why it smelt like urine everywhere. The building is absolutely disgusting. Once we finally found the room, we were welcomed by an awful smell in the hallway and the entire hallway was filled with toys and equipment, they must have been a neighbors but nonetheless,  it didnt leave much room for walking. Once we got into the SHARED apartment, there was stuff everywhere. The kitchen had probably 20 alcohol bottles out on the counter and the whole place just looked a wreck. After being in the apartment for all of two minutes we knew there was no way we could stay here. We ended up booking a hotel for two nights, that was not cheap but there was no price tag we could put on it. Save yourself the time and I would never even consider this place. I have never written and bad review on Airbnb, and we dont feel like we are picky travelers but we felt it was necessary to warn anyone that is considering staying here."
6657775,"Maria met me at the trolly stop and walked me over to her flat.  It took less than 5 minutes.  Once I got into the flat I could smell a cat box.  Maria explained to me about five times how to shut my bedroom door.  When I moved the night stand to plug in my phone, Maria moved the nightstand back to its original place - she didn't even give me a chance to.  There were about 59 rules for using the kitchen.  Maria mentioned no less than three times not to open the doors quickly or I would bump her cat.  Unfortunately, I could not understand how to make the front door lock and unlock.  Again, there were like 48 steps to make the door lock and unlock.  Maybe it was because I had had a very long flight and an even longer day, but I had a difficult time putting all the steps together to make the door lock and unlock.  Maria was so rude when I made mistakes.  She was condescending, impolite, impatient and did not hide her anger with me.  The whole experience was so awful that I just gave up and checked myself into a hotel.  I just left Maria's space altogether.  Not recommended."
7749107,"It's an ok place to stay but we wouldn't book this accommodation again! 

There are certainly a few things that need updating in this flat. The worst bit for us was the shower situation - we specifically booked a place with two bathrooms and two working showers for a good reason... but we ended up with only one shower kind of working ( it had very weak water pressure, awful if you try to rinse off shampoo from long hair). We have been made aware of the broken second shower two days before arrival and let Joan know that this is very inconvenient for us. We received a small discount after contacting Airbnb with the  issue but would have preferred a working shower. Apparently she couldn't fix it as the apartment was fully booked for the whole week but one could have at least tried it since we only arrived in the evening - that made a minimum of 9 hours to get a plumber in.

Anyways, apart from that there have been a few other issues with the flat regarding cleanliness (spider webs on the ceilings, dusty) and a weird smell in the whole house (we couldn't figure out where it came from). The beds are very uncomfortable and there are multiple lose or broken appliances - one of the armchairs in the living room e.g. is broken and can't be used. Also, the flat in general is not soundproofed at all - bring some ear plugs for the night."
898411,"We would not recommend this place for the following reasons :
- too expensive for what you get despite the location. Dave is banking solely on the central location but doesnt offer a comfortable space
- too cluttered with personal belongings

- poor facilities : poor quality threadbare old bedding and towels, shower wasnt working and wasnt being fixed while we were there for 4 nights"
3411757,"We felt it was over priced as we had on going mainenance issues of broken dish washer, bathroom door didn' t lock. Surely when the host knew they had the appartment booked they should have made repairs or refunded some of the payment as they didn't fulfill what was paid for. Also rumbling noise of trains could be heard as the appartment is below ground level and poor mobil reception. Location was good."

When I got to the apt, which was not so easy to find, the concierge told me that there were no keys left so I couldnt get in although I was told beforehand that I can arrive at any time î and I was even late for the official time as stated in the profile. Alison was on vacation so the communication took some time. It came out that the cleaner completely forgot. After 2.5 hrs I finally had the keys. After this unfortunate start, I had a nice stay at this place. Great view from the loft, great location. Hope the key issue was only a one time thing :)"
800026,"Roy was a very warm and kind host who responded promptly to our questions. Unfortunately, this is the first property (in 4 years on Airbnb) I have felt compelled to give a critical review. (1) Airbnb should never have listed this under 'entire place'. The description says it is only 'entire place' if 10 people book. We had nine, and although Roy didn't host anyone else, his description claims he could have. Further, there was someone walking through the halls late at night talking on the phone, which has never happened in another 'entire place' booking. (2) I would recommend clearly reading the whole description more carefully than normal. Even so, I feel some of what is said (and not said) is misleading. The 'kitchen come sitting room' is really a small kitchen with a small table. He never mentions that there is no living room. (3) He also never mentions that the property is disjointed. My in-laws stayed in one section of the house, and they had to walk outside to the kitchen. The rest of us stayed in another part of the house, and we also had to walk outside to get to the kitchen. It was an Airbnb built around three sides of a house, not a single unit. (4) The upkeep of the property was not great, and we felt more like we were in a camp than somewhere 'warm and cozy'. The hot water system was not equipped to handle a large group taking short showers, and Roy advertises enough beds for 5 more people. (5) The price was out of proportion to the value. If you are having a Stag party, this property works well, but I would not recommend it for other groups."

1754515,"I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, but after flying for 6 plus hours and then having to walk around an unknown city to Jamess wifes old work to get the keys at 5:00 in the morning it makes it hard. The accommodations were subpar at best. The bed felt like we were sleeping on a box spring and the pillows were paper thin. The couch had a giant rip in it, and there was only a small heater for the whole place. I would not recommend this place to anyone staying in Dublin."
6518542,"I would not recommend  stay in this place at all
1)	Bed and smelly mattress and bedset. I have been stayed in many Airbnb for last 3 years, I never had any problem with any of the place, but this place the bed set, matters is so old and smell horrible, I have to spent 80 Euro to buy a whole brand new bed set , so I can sleep. The mattress is supper old and smelly too. Everyday morning I have to leave the window open so I can stay  at night in the room .  

2)	Bad host behavior.  I was not be allowed to do laundry until after 11:00pm because Adam need to watch TV in the living room, he said it is very noise, but the water laundry is such a small one, the noise is not bad all, he just do not want to sacrifice even a little for his guest at all. The worst thing is that , he put his short in my laundry, next day in the morning I saw a man short in my laundry, I was pissed off and ask him why he did that , he denied what he did, so the short has leg and walked into the laundry itself?

3)	Unflushed toilet. Yes!!!!! Can you imaged that when you used the toilet in the morning, there some unflushed poop in the toilet and you saw it? That is f** so disgusting, it happened couple times, even tho on the day the day I checked out the place,  I saw it again, basically I lost my whole appetite  the whole day by seeing that, trust it , if you stay there ,you need to prepare for unflushed poop and the image will just hang in your mind all the time.  

4)	Horrible shower. It is impossible to take a good shower in this apt,  I have to go to gym everyday only for shower, feel free to stay here if you never shower 

5)	 the apartment is very old, which is fun, I paid $2000 for one month, I felt I definitely overpaid for a place like that for sure

6)	Lies. I asked Adam, how many people stay in the places, he said only himself, but turns out his girlfriend came to stay over all the time. Sometimes I have to wait for them to stop use the restroom so I can use the restroom, if I know there are 2 ppl stay there and I have to share the restroom with 2 other person I will never stay there. 

7)	Dirty Kitchen, if you want to use the kitchen to wash an apple, forget it, there are always dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and supper smelly with flies. 

8)	Noise from street, it is very close to the road, the noise is not too bad at night, but it will become really bad start early morning. I got woke up early in the morning by the car noise from the street, so I have to have a Nosie proof headset on, so I will not be woke up in the morning, which is very uncomfortable. 

All my Airbnb stay in last 3 years are all positive, this is my first time to give a negative review, because I have to speak out my mind this time , because it is such bizarre experience"
6685082,"This comment is NOT linked to the property itself, we never had the chance to go there.

We booked a room for 3 people, and Betty contacted us few hours before the arrival to say that she only had 2 spaces available. 

We kindly asked her to cancel in order to find another room, she declined saying that we have to do it. 

This is a false information, in that situation SHE cannot welcome is so SHE has to cancel, otherwise we are the faulty one. 

We had to call the support in order to get some help. 

Would not recommend, based on our exchange with Betty. 

many thanks to AirB&B for helping us finding another roomù"
6782117,Dirty and a very noisy location.  May be OK for college kids but for a family I would not recommend this place at all.
7108543,"This apartment is in a great location, with great views. Booked for a birthday weekend with friends and first impressions were great. However, the finishing touches were lacking greatly. The apartment was dirty, with food crumbs in cupboards, dirty cupboard doors, dusty surfaces in all rooms. Bathrooms were also dirty and taps did not work properly meaning one shower was cold and the other scorching hot. The window seals in the double bedroom had been sealed with gaffer tape which did not stop the draft. 
The host did assist quickly with the broken remote controlled blinds and when we were without water for a night (no working toilets). Such a shame as this apartment could be amazing. Considering the high price tag for our stay, I would not recommend."

The unit has two bed rooms that were comfortable and two full bathrooms and a living area. No TV but Wifi and a large kitchen. Right below the unit is Dublin Cookie company- great for coffee or cookies in the morning. There is a Lidl just a short walk (2 mins) down the road for snacks, sandwiches, wine/drinks or whatever else you may need. We walked to Arthurs Pub for a great lunch and drinks. Also to Guinness (about a 10 min walk). I would not recommend walking around outside the unit late at night alone. The entrance door to the unit is in an alleyway that is dark..."
4319495,"Overall this was a very disappointing Air B and B experience. 

My partner and I;
¢	travel extensively, 
¢	stay in Air B and Bs regularly, 
¢	are Air B and B super hosts in Canada,
and this is the only negative review that we have ever given.

Essentially, 7 St Finbars Rd is a boarding house. There were 8 other people renting space in this house and the owner/host lives off-site. We never met him or his partner, the other host. There are 6 permanent tenants who live upstairs and 2 Air B and B suites downstairs. The kitchen and laundry room are in constant use by all of these people.
The problems we encountered were as follows:
¢	The shared bathroom on the main floor has no ventilation and there is an overpowering smell of mould. The bathroom has no window or operating fan. The mould appears to be in the sub-floor level and everyone living in the house comments on it. The regular tenants use the upstairs bathroom. Both Air B and B rooms must use this bathroom. 
¢	We had only one meeting with a co-host. Juan briefly explained the house rules. We did not see the co-host again throughout our 4 day stay. We were not advised if we were allowed to use any of the common space.
¢	The bathroom sink did not drain. We advised Juan of this issue on the first day. For 3 days we brushed our teeth in the shower as the issue with the drain trap was not addressed.
¢	False advertising. The listing advertised that the hosts were a gay couple. This attracts people like ourselves. We are gay and were hoping to be in a home that was welcoming. Instead, we were 2 of 10 people in a small house where there was no communication between the permanent residents and the temporary (Air B and B) residents. 
¢	There were multiple posters and signs telling us the rules (eg. take out the garbage). But there was no attention to cleanliness of the bathroom or laundry area. No bath mats or towels were replaced throughout our 4 day stay (even through there was another Air B and B couple staying in the next room.
¢	The bed linens were threadbare and bleach stained. The pillows were ancient and lumpy.
¢	The 2 Air B and B rooms are aside the common bathroom and laundry. The Air B and B area (including the laundry and bathroom) is converted garage and the laundry runs constantly due to the high number of residents in this house. At times we would have to move the laundry racks and baskets just to enter our room, which was beside the laundry room. 
Overall, even considering the low price, this was our most disappointing Air B and B experience ever."
449556,"Basic accommodations, one notch above a hostel and therefore over priced. Compared to the 4 other Airbnb we stayed at in Ireland it  was disappointing."
3374950,"My wife and I had a horrendous experience with this AirBnB rental. While we found that the host was responsive during the booking process, that was not the case the day prior to or during our check-in. The day of arrival we tried to reach out to the host through Airbnb messages, (Hidden by Airbnb) , and SMS to see if we could check in early. We failed to receive any sort of response (later she claimed via Airbnb message to have sent a message earlier that did not go through but AirBnB customer support says that there was no issue with their system). When we arrived at the location early (~12:30-1pm) she did allow us to drop our bags off early and ~specifically~ said she would clean the place prior to the official check in time at 3pm. We left the location to allow time to clean and returned at 3pm. In person she stated that her son had been at home the previous night to party in Dublin and had used the rental the previous evening; later via AirBnB this changed to previous Airbnb rentersù. Upon return (during our official check-in) we began to experience severe issues with the property and host. 
The first issue we discovered was that the property had not been cleaned. A quick walkthrough showed several problems: the bed sheets were dirty, the sink was full of unwashed dishes, several used acrylic nails and false eyelashes were found on the couch and the bathroom floor, and general dirt and what appeared to be salad leaves on the floors. Further inspection revealed more worrying conditions than just general grime. The fridge had old food in it that expired months ago. The freezer was filled with frost and unusable. The toaster oven was covered in grim on the inside and clearly had not been cleaned in a while. There were lights falling out of the ceiling. In addition to 2 empty rolls of toilet paper on the holder, there was 1 spare toilet paper roll on the top of the cabinet in the bathroom, but this was thoroughly saturated with water and covered in dirt. The shower looked as though it had not been cleaned in a long time and appeared to have black mold on the grouting. There were makeup stains on one of the couch cushions. There is a door in the bed room that leads upstairs that you cannot lock from the renters side yet allows full access from the main house. However, most concerning is the fact that the dry wall above and behind the bed has water damage and peeling paint. Its clear there was or is a leak in those two areas and that the damage has yet to be addressed. This is concerning due to the possibility of mold behind the drywall. My personal observation is it appeared someone tried to scrub the walls with cleaning agent, however, these two locations were directly above the bed, and worse, in the murphy bed where the bed sits against the wall (meaning the mold from the wall was likely in contact with the bed).  
Within 20 min. of check-in we contacted AirBnB for resolution of the stated issues. After explaining the issue with the property and providing photo evidence of each issue to 2 different AirBnB customer service representative they finally contacted the host for resolution (more than one hour after the initial conversation and check-in). From my understanding upon discussion with the AirBnB rep, the host told AirBnB that we did not ask for the place to be cleaned when we showed up early. The host then showed up at our door and asked if we would like to leave so that she could clean the place. Bear in mind that this was the beginning stop of our honeymoon, where my wife and I had spent at least 20 hours non-stop in travel time, and it was now 5pm after spending over an hour on the phone trying to resolve this issue when we really wanted to eat and rest. We inquired as to how she would fix the larger issues like the dry wall, freezer, and very dirty shower grouting. Her response was a flustered and angry Ill tell you what¶thanks!ù She then angrily turned around and walked away. At this point AirBnB fully refunded our rental, but we were forced to find and book a hotel that evening with very limited options and time. AirBnB offered to help rebook us in a new AirBnB, however, due to the fact we had booked this accommodation weeks earlier, there were no other comparable options in either location or cost to the original booking. A hotel was the only available option to us at such a last minute, and the cheapest one cost us an additional $1,000 above what we expected to pay. AirBnB reimbursed $291 of this cost but it is still a substantial loss for us.   
This was an especially frustrating and disappointing start to our honeymoon, which included a large monetary loss and a wasted day and a half dealing with the host and AirBnB. We were fully aware of the limits to the accommodation we had booked and were not expecting a penthouse, but we were expecting it to be meet a basic level of cleanliness and safety. I cannot stress enough how much I would recommend staying away from this location and host due to the issues we had and monetary loss we suffered."
3789686,Not worth the price as compared to the other places we stayed at. The place was in a good location but was extremely tiny and felt crowded. Pictures online were misleading. Just seemed like the owners storage space which we lived in. Cupboards still contained the owners shoes etc and a huge cupboard taking up alot of space in the room which was locked. Everything was basic. If u just need a bed at a high price then this is for u. The common areas didnt feel like so as U get the feeling the owner does not want u there. U get sent from the door directly to the tiny room on arrival. Quite disappointing. Good location is what u pay for perhaps..
4319495,"Overall this was a very disappointing Air B and B experience. 

My partner and I;
¢	travel extensively, 
¢	stay in Air B and Bs regularly, 
¢	are Air B and B super hosts in Canada,
and this is the only negative review that we have ever given.

Essentially, 7 St Finbars Rd is a boarding house. There were 8 other people renting space in this house and the owner/host lives off-site. We never met him or his partner, the other host. There are 6 permanent tenants who live upstairs and 2 Air B and B suites downstairs. The kitchen and laundry room are in constant use by all of these people.
The problems we encountered were as follows:
¢	The shared bathroom on the main floor has no ventilation and there is an overpowering smell of mould. The bathroom has no window or operating fan. The mould appears to be in the sub-floor level and everyone living in the house comments on it. The regular tenants use the upstairs bathroom. Both Air B and B rooms must use this bathroom. 
¢	We had only one meeting with a co-host. Juan briefly explained the house rules. We did not see the co-host again throughout our 4 day stay. We were not advised if we were allowed to use any of the common space.
¢	The bathroom sink did not drain. We advised Juan of this issue on the first day. For 3 days we brushed our teeth in the shower as the issue with the drain trap was not addressed.
¢	False advertising. The listing advertised that the hosts were a gay couple. This attracts people like ourselves. We are gay and were hoping to be in a home that was welcoming. Instead, we were 2 of 10 people in a small house where there was no communication between the permanent residents and the temporary (Air B and B) residents. 
¢	There were multiple posters and signs telling us the rules (eg. take out the garbage). But there was no attention to cleanliness of the bathroom or laundry area. No bath mats or towels were replaced throughout our 4 day stay (even through there was another Air B and B couple staying in the next room.
¢	The bed linens were threadbare and bleach stained. The pillows were ancient and lumpy.
¢	The 2 Air B and B rooms are aside the common bathroom and laundry. The Air B and B area (including the laundry and bathroom) is converted garage and the laundry runs constantly due to the high number of residents in this house. At times we would have to move the laundry racks and baskets just to enter our room, which was beside the laundry room. 
Overall, even considering the low price, this was our most disappointing Air B and B experience ever."

The host did say he would turn on the water heater in the morning (for shaving), but there was no hot water when I shaved at 7am. Otherwise, everything else was OK. Host (Albert) was pleasant, the location is about 20 minute walk from 'downtown' Malahide."
